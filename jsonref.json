Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Too much of it and the reader may well want their money back. Too little and what’s left of suspense, mystery, drama? In literature as in life, there is much to learn from what is left unsaid.For writers, silence is a gift. Whether it comes in the form of characters confined to silence or those committed to muting voices that are deemed dangerously other, there are few authors who haven’t at some point grappled with the question of how best to represent, well, nothing.I have long been fascinated by silence. As noisy child and adolescent, I experienced a fair few arched eyebrows when I decided to write my undergraduate dissertation on ellipsis in modernist literature. Fast forward four years to when I started writing fiction and the subject of silence was still at the forefront of my mind, specifically the sort that can settle at the centre of a long-term relationship.In my novel, The Silent Treatment, Frank and Maggie have been married for 40 years but they haven’t spoken for the last six months. It is at once an uplifting love story and a mystery, an emotional drama and a meditation on trauma in a family. The further I explored the subject of silence in my characters’ lives, the more I learned that it is a compound of nuances that mean something different to everyone. Silence can be both terrifying and calming, at once isolating and communicative in its own way, depending on who is expressing it.If I were to identify one unifying feature in the books listed below, it would be the way in which readers themselves are made to work harder when confronted with an impenetrable quiet. After all, it could be saying anything …1. Titus Andronicus by William ShakespeareAfter being brutally raped, Titus’s daughter, Lavinia, also has her tongue pulled out and her hands cut off to stop her reporting who is responsible for the attack. Incapacitated and robbed of her precious chastity, Lavinia’s powerlessness becomes a potent symbol of the silencing of abused women.2. The Silence of the Girls by Pat BarkerBarker retells the Iliad primarily from the perspective of Briseis, the woman awarded as a prize to Achilles after the ransacking of Lyrnessus. With the narrative in her hands, there is nowhere to hide from the misogyny of ancient Greece. Ajax may be convinced that “silence becomes a woman”, but it is through Barker’s reclaiming of the voices muted by history that we realise just how much modern resonance these classical stories hold in the #MeToo era.3. A Quiet Kind of Thunder by Sara BarnardWhen Steffi, a selective mute, meets Rhys, a deaf pupil at her school, their worlds begin to open up. For Steffi, the prospect of speech is riddled with anxiety and Barnard provides a sensitive exploration of the issue for a young adult audience. Steffi and Rhys communicate in part through BSL, a fascinating entry point into deaf culture. As their friendship quietly builds in something more, will Steffi find her voice and the courage to use it, again?4. The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullersJohn Singer starts the novel as one of two mutes in a small, Georgia mill town. When his best friend George is taken to a mental institution, John becomes isolated. Until, that is, he begins to take his meals in a local cafe and establishes himself as the silent confidant for the various people who frequent it. A beautiful exploration of conversation, its difficulties and the often-mystical search for understanding.5. The House of Spirits by Isabel AllendeFollowing the lives of three generations of the Trueba family, this novel is marked by the decision of matriarch Clara to fall silent for nine years after the death of her older sister. In place of speech, Clara turns to writing, art and her spiritual powers as alternative means to connect with the world around her. This is suitably beguiling proof that shouting the loudest isn’t always the best way to be heard.6. The Girl Who Smiled Beads by Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth WeilIn this memoir, we follow Wamariya’s journey from the Rwandan massacre in 1994 through the six years she and her sister spent displaced in seven African countries, until they are eventually granted refugee status in the US. As she reflects on her trauma, Wamariya struggles with the inability of language to do justice to her lived experience. It is impossible to forget the passage where she explores why “genocide” fails to capture the full scope of an atrocity: “You cannot bear witness with a single word.”7. Pilgrimage by Dorothy RichardsonThis little-known novel follows Miriam Henderson across 13 volumes (or “novel-chapters” as Richardson wanted them to be known), following her quotidian life as a young working woman in early 20th-century London. The text is characterised by a high quantity of ellipses (‘…’) as Richardson plays into a wider modernist fascination with absence and its representation. A long read, but one that more than rewards the effort and, in the process, sheds light on the silence that lies at the heart of consciousness.8. Atonement by Ian McEwanTo keep shtum, or not to keep shtum – that’s one of the big questions in play in this Booker prize-shortlisted novel. From Paul and Lola’s silence over Robbie’s wrongful imprisonment to Briony’s attempt at repentance through voicing her version of the truth, it’s a story that shows just how compelling silence can be as a narrative device.9. The Outrun by Amy LiptrotAt 30, Liptrot moves from London to Orkney, the site of her childhood, as she comes to terms with the alcoholism that characterised her 20s. In the dichotomy between city and island life, urban noise and wild silence, it’s a stunning meditation on the restorative power of nature and its power to heal.10. Silence: In the Age of Noise by Erling KaggeAs an adventurer, Kagge was the first person to complete the “three poles challenge”, reaching the north pole, south pole and the summit of Everest. Rest assured, he isn’t encouraging a trip to anyall of the three in a quest to find silence in the modern world. Rather, Kagge advocates finding pockets of quiet throughout everyday life – whether that’s on the walk to work, in the shower, or taking a moment of stillness over a sandwich during lunchbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822c1c325599f98be074a5bf95361c3e62b3b67c/0_0_2379_3234/master/2379.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=178837e5145884c8064a9a4f6b74fcdd 960w","title":"trust in airlines and holiday firms plummets says which coronavirus","story":"Public trust in the travel industry has plunged to an all-time low as airlines and holiday companies continue to deny and delay refunds for coronavirus cancellations, in breach of the law, according to new research from a UK consumer group.The latest consumer insight tracker from Which? reveals that trust in airlines and holiday companies has slumped from a net score of nine in February 2020 to -12 in May 2020, a fall of 21 points and the lowest in the seven years of collecting the data.Last month Which? said all of the UK’s major airlines and holiday companies were openly breaking the law by delaying refunds for cancelled trips or removing customers’ refund rights. The industry’s own estimates suggested that up to £7bn of travellers’ money was affected.Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said:“These latest figures are a damning indictment of the behaviour of many airlines and holiday companies in recent weeks. With customers being told to either wait months for their money back or accept a voucher that may prove worthless if a company fails, it should come as a surprise to no one that trust has plummeted so drastically.”He urged the industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to “come down strongly on any airlines found to be systemically denying or delaying refunds for cancelled flights and holidays” and for the government to set out how it will support the industry and restore trust in the sector.A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: “The impact of Covid-19 on UK aviation has been severe and truly unprecedented, with a huge increase in cancellations following travel restrictions and lockdowns around the world. Airlines continue to face a far higher volume of refund claims than normal. They are doing everything they can to work through the backlog and thank customers for their patience.”Separately, the UK’s independent watchdog said some rail commuters are waiting six weeks or more for a refund on their season ticket. The new survey from Transport Focus found that more than a third of passengers holding season tickets had not yet received a refund. In addition, six out of 10 passengers hadn’t been kept informed how long their claim could take."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e660868a9b240a1ba1649da4c553eec53f3c9dce/0_204_3052_1831/master/3052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24d9e98fb78f844e091104337fa67612","title":"uk inflation tumbles energy clothes discounting covid 19 ftse pound business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as UK inflation hits its lowest level since 2016Fast food chain McDonald’s has taken another step towards normality by resuming drive-through services at nearly 40 restaurants in the UK and Ireland.All the UK restaurants are in the South East of England - including in Luton, Peterborough, Chelmsford, Ipswich, Watford, Medway, Harrow and West Sutton. Six sites in Dublin are also reopening.McDonalds says it expects high demand. It has introduced new safe working measures to prevent Covid-19 spreading, but warns that sites could close again if necessary to protect staff. World trade volumes are likely to “fall precipitously” in the first half of 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic batters the global economy.That’s the latest warning from the World Trade Organisation, which says its goods barometer is now “flashing red” as trade volumes fall.This index of trade volumes has slumped to 87.6, the lowest since it was launched in July 2016 - and some way below the 100 points baseline.The WTO warns that there is “no sign of the trade decline bottoming out yet”. Shipments of new cars have fallen particularly dramatically, the WTO adds, although technology products are holding up better.The automotive products index (79.7) was weakest of all, due to collapsing car production and sales in major economies. The sharp decline in the forward-looking export orders index (83.3) suggests that trade weakness will persist in the short-run.Declines in the container shipping (88.5) and air freight (88.0) indices reflect weak demand for traded goods as well as supply-side constraints arising from efforts to suppress COVID-19. Only the indices for electronic components (94.0) and agricultural raw materials (95.7) show signs of stability, although they too remain below trend. City analyst Kit Juckes of Société Générale has spotted some interesting trends in the this morning’s UK inflation report:Newsflash: Inflation across the eurozone has slumped to its lowest level in almost four years - just like in the UK.As in Britain, lower energy prices pulled CPI down - thanks to the glut of crude oil caused by the pandemic and the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.But, eurostat also found that food, alcohol and tobacco prices rose last month:In April, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from food, alcohol \u0026amp tobacco (+0.67 percentage points, pp), followed by services (+0.52 pp), non-energy industrial goods (+0.09 pp) and energy (-0.97 pp).My colleague Zoe Wood explains how M\u0026ampS’s sales have deteriorated under the lockdown:Just in: UK house prices picked up in March, just before the pandemic forced the housing market to freeze.Here are more details of Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s plan to ride out the pandemic, via the BBC’s Emma Simpson.Here’s our news story on today’s inflation report:Looking ahead... Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, warns that inflation could spike once the pandemic is overHe points out that the huge stimulus measures launched by central banks and governments could ultimately push up the cost of living:“The drop in inflation to its lowest level since 2016 reflects a fall in petrol costs as well as the impact of lower end demand on factory gate prices. “In the short term, disinflationary pressures will mount as the economy slows under lockdown, consumers become more cautious and companies start to prepare for life beyond furlough support by reducing their workforces. Further out, there is a growing fear that monetary and fiscal policy choices could lead to higher inflation, perhaps significantly so. “Investors have started to prepare for a more inflationary environment by adding to their holdings of gold, the traditional hedge against rising prices. The precious metal is trading close to a seven-year high.”But in the short-term, the trend is clearly downward:High street chain Marks \u0026amp Spencer has outlined how the lockdown will hurt its business - and it’s an alarming picture.M\u0026ampS has already been hit by the pandemic, telling shareholders:The firm also reported that costs and stock write downs for Covid-19 have cost £212.8m.

Then Boris Johnson et al deliberately de-prepared usWe are trapped in a long, dark tunnel, all of whose known exits are blocked. There is no plausible route out of the UK’s coronavirus crisis that does not involve mass suffering and death. If, as some newspapers and Conservative MPs insist, the government eases the lockdown while the pandemic is still raging, the eventual death toll could be several times greater than today’s. If it doesn’t, and we spend all the warm months of the year in confinement, the impact on our mental and physical health, jobs and relationships could be catastrophic.We have been told repeatedly that the UK was unprepared for this pandemic. This is untrue. The UK was prepared, but then it de-prepared. Last year, the Global Health Security Index ranked this nation second in the world for pandemic readiness, while the US was first. Broadly speaking, in both nations the necessary systems were in place. Our governments chose not to use them.The climate modeller James Annan has used his analytical methods to show what would have happened if the UK government had imposed its lockdown a week earlier. Starting it on 16 March, rather than 23 March, his modelling suggests, would by now have saved around 30,000 lives, reducing the rate of illness and death from coronavirus roughly by a factor of five.But even 16 March would have been extraordinarily late. We now know that government ministers were told on 11 February that the virus could be catastrophic, and decisive action was urgently required. Instead, Boris Johnson told us to wash our hands and “go about our normal daily lives”.Had the government acted in February, we can hazard a guess about what the result would have been, as the world has conducted a clear controlled experiment: weighing South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand against the UK, the US and Brazil. South Korea did everything the UK government could have done, but refused to implement. Its death toll so far: 263. It still has an occasional cluster of infection, which it promptly contains. By contrast, the entire UK is now a cluster of infection.While other countries either closed their borders or quarantined all arrivals, in the three months between the emergence of the virus and the UK’s lockdown, 18 million people arrived on these shores, of whom only 273 were quarantined. Even after the lockdown was announced, 95,000 people entered the UK without additional restrictions. In fact, on 13 March, the UK stood down even its own guidance, which had gently requested travellers from Italy and China to self-isolate. This decision, taken as other nations were stepping up their controls, seems baffling.Similarly, on 12 March, Johnson abandoned both containment and nationwide testing and tracking. A week later, the status of the pandemic was lowered, which meant that the government could reduce the standard of personal protective equipment required in hospitals, and could shift infectious patients into non-specialist care. Again, there was no medical or scientific justification for this decision.Exercise Cygnus, a pandemic simulation conducted in 2016, found that the impacts in care homes would be catastrophic unless new measures were put in place. The government insists that it heeded the findings of this exercise and changed its approach accordingly. If this is correct, by allowing untested patients to be shifted from hospitals to care homes, while failing to provide the extra support and equipment the homes needed and allowing agency workers to move freely within and between them, it knowingly breached its own protocols. Tens of thousands of highly vulnerable people were exposed to infection.In other words, none of these are failures of knowledge or capacity. They are de-preparations, conscious decisions not to act. They start to become explicable only when we recognise what they have in common: a refusal to frontload the costs. This refusal is common in countries whose governments fetishise what we call “the market”: the euphemism we use for the power of money.Johnson’s government, like that of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, represents a particular kind of economic interest. For years politicians of their stripe have been in conflict with people who perform useful services: nurses, teachers, care workers and the other low-paid people who keep our lives ticking, whose attempts to organise and secure better pay and conditions are demonised by ministers and in the media.This political conflict is always fought on behalf of the same group: those who extract wealth. The war against utility is necessary if you want to privatise public services, granting lucrative monopolies or fire sales of public assets to friends in the private sector. It’s necessary if you want to hold down public sector pay and the minimum wage, cutting taxes and bills for the same funders and lobbyists. It is necessary if corporations are to be allowed to outsource and offshore their workforces, and wealthy people can offshore their income and assets.The interests of wealth extractors are, by definition, short term. They ert money that might otherwise have been used for investment into idends and share buybacks. They dump costs that corporations should legitimately bear on to society in general, in the form of pollution (the car and road lobbies) or public health disasters (soft drinks and junk food producers). They siphon money out of an enterprise or a nation as quickly as possible, before the tax authorities, regulators or legislators catch up.Years of experience have shown that it is much cheaper to make political donations, employ lobbyists and invest in public relations than to change lucrative but harmful commercial policies. Working through the billionaire press and political systems that are highly vulnerable to capture by money, in the UK, US and Brazil they have helped ensure that cavalier and reckless people are elected. Their chosen representatives have an almost instinctive aversion to investment, to carrying a cost today that could be deferred, delayed or dumped on someone else.It’s not that any of these interests – whether the Daily Mail or the US oil companies – want coronavirus to spread.

However, this isn’t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it’s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are safe enough to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff and parents alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of “test, trace and isolate” strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.That scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. A recent study in the Lancet found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don’t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can’t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.Given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium, that aren’t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils – because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities – or to focus on older pupils – because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead – is a political one.Flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.Given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented – and then only if “test, trace, isolate”, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.The tragedy is that the countries that moved the fastest and “crunched the curve” are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what’s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the UK government’s poor decisions over the past 12 weeks.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.That wasn’t to be. Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has limited effect on Covid-19’s spread. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.With the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pitting himself against the bulk of his party over a gradual rather than a rapid easing of lockdown, the UK is now on course to move at a more stately pace than its European counterparts when it comes to socialising, the reopening of bars – and holidays. While the EU has a three-stage plan to restart tourism, and Italy and Spain aim to reopen for visitors as early as June, the UK is taking a rather different approach.Next month, a two-week quarantine is being introduced for all new arrivals to the UK, including British people returning from abroad. The move has been heavily criticised by the travel industry, with one trade body warning it will have a “devastating” impact on the UK aviation industry and the wider economy.However, with Johnson determined to press on with what one No 10 adviser describes as the “slow and steady” path out of lockdown, the focus in government is not on appeasing airline companies but working out how to keep a potentially restless British public onside while its neighbours holiday.Even if talks of “air bridges” – allowing quarantine-free travel to and from low-infection countries such as Greece – come to fruition, the general sense in government is that the bulk of Britons will not be jetting abroad this summer.As well as quarantine and safety concerns, the economic reality means extravagant holidays just won’t be an option for many. With unemployment set to increase even further and many on reduced household incomes, holidays are likely to be a luxury that people cannot afford. Social distancing practices mean that budget flights, too, could soon become much harder to find.As a result, ministers have begun to work out what they can do to keep morale up over the long summer months. While public support is now very much for lockdown continuing, the worry is what happens when other countries enjoy breaks with more ease. “If the R number rises in these countries as a result, we’ll be praised for our response – if it doesn’t, we might start to get some heat,” explains one government figure.The great hope is that the weather gods will shine on the UK. The evidence suggests that activity outside carries a much lower risk of transmission than inside. Just look at how Northern Ireland is now allowing a half dozen people from different households to gather, if they are outside. All the plans to relax socialising coming down the tracks are based on being outside. “If it rains, we’re fucked,” says one rather blunt Tory MP.“Britain’s going to look like the 1940s this summer,” predicts a government insider privy to discussions. Expect Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beach, camping breaks and, if we’re lucky, drive-in cinemas.Talks are under way across departments to see what can be done to help retail businesses move outside. There is a focus on encouraging local councils to make it easy to cut red tape for businesses so they can adapt to a new normal in which trading outside is the preferred option. Inside No 10, one good-case scenario for mid-summer is that people will be permitted to dine outside at a restaurant with someone they don’t live with.While restaurants and cafes are viewed as potential beneficiaries of good weather, the prospects for a lazy summer afternoon in the pub are bleaker. The concern is that the low cost of a pint means that it won’t be financially viable for a pub to open its garden while taking in just a small number of people – whereas a more expensive restaurant could manage. But entrepreneurial landlords will be encouraged to think outside the box.The first holiday likely to be allowed will be camping – if that works out, then private home hire could be next. Hotels are viewed as harder to reopen due to the number of people coming and going. Discussions are under way over an extended holiday season – not just the typical high season of peak summer months – given that changing circumstances mean the traditional holiday period cannot be relied upon.Ministers are considering promoting parts of the UK that are usually off the tourist trail. With an increase expected in the number of domestic tourists, it’s not only viewed as an opportunity to promote undiscovered spots – it could also be what’s needed to keep MPs on side. On Tory WhatsApp, Devon and Cornwall MPs are already worried about an influx of people to their constituencies – with locals concerned about the virus spreading. However, in No 10 there’s a sense that “common sense” will allow everyone an opportunity to explore.However, for all the efforts to keep the UK entertained this summer, the biggest risk factor may be not the weather but the economy. The furlough scheme is up for review in August and companies will be asked to pay a higher contribution. There is concern among MPs that this could be a crunch point for high unemployment. If that comes to pass, no amount of ice-cream by the coast or sitting around campfires will be enough to distract from the bad times ahead.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cd85a5ba561cf69258ef5b9218b5ff2ca3acb5f/0_68_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=575e2d8c34a2c74a2e83589030170aff","title":"what is the secret of the laughing buttocks the great british art quiz","story":"Dorich House Museum in London has set today’s quiz, the latest in a series that enables you to explore the art collections of British museums closed due to coronavirus – while answering some very tough questionsThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists.

Now, as a deep recession bites, conservation funding is likely to be further hit as donors and philanthropic funders channel money towards human health.During the austerity of the 2010s, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) suffered bigger cuts than any other department. Is there any reason to expect anything different this time around?Many environmentalists hope there is. The eight-week experience of lockdown has transformed public attitudes towards local green spaces, neighbourhood nature and wild species. Conservation charities are determined to mobilise this new interest.“We’re definitely in an unfrozen moment with being connected to nature,” said Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB. “There’s this shift from consumer to citizen and all that goes with that in terms of community, place and sense of where you fit in the natural world and the global world. There’s a real opportunity to open that door which is tremendously exciting.”NGOs such as the Wildlife Trusts, with its popular #30dayswild campaign in June, whereby people pledge to undertake “random acts of wildness” each day, are encouraging public engagement in nature by showing its physical and mental health benefits. This will be key to ensuring that nature is seen as relevant by policymakers as society adapts to the coronavirus world.“Nature conservation charities need to be part of the green recovery,” said Julie Williams, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation. “It’s vital charities are welcomed into a post-Covid-19 recovery programme fully funded by a government that grasps that interest in nature which people are discovering. Could we work in greater partnership with Public Health England and the NHS to help with that health and wellbeing agenda which will be so important as we start to recover?”Butterfly Conservation and the RSPB are also developing more projects to boost urban wildlife, while the very white conservation sector is acutely aware it needs to become more erse to encourage a more widespread range of supporters.Transformed public appreciation for nature and green space may push government policy, but conservationists know their ability to reverse decades of bioersity losses ultimately depends on funding.The impact of austerity, according to Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, is evident in cash-strapped government agencies such as Natural England and the Environment Agency. “Statutory agencies are no longer delivering even a minimally acceptable service,” said Shardlow.Although the government announced on Monday a £15m boost for Natural England this year, it will only make up a small amount of the cuts to the body over the past decade, during which funding dropped from £265m in 2008-2009 to a low of £86.5m in 2019-20. The key, says Shardlow, is to ensure the countryside is restored so it can perform ecological functions again – prevent flooding, for instance, and become rich once more in pollinators and other insects that provide natural pest control. The most cost-effective method is wildlife corridors so species can move through the landscape when challenged by climate change.Even in a deep recession, there is money. Under the EU, British farming received £3.4bn each year. The post-Brexit farm subsidy, the Environmental Land Management scheme, is still being developed. If reality matches its vision – public money not for unsustainable farming practices but for public goods, such as preventing flooding, improving soils or boosting bioersity – nature conservation could be transformed.“A lot of the £3.4bn does need to go to bioersity and the environment,” said Shardlow, who hopes that the new public mood will be matched by increased determination within Defra to resist further cuts.“Defra were very compliant last time,” said Shardlow. “I hope they’ve learned their lesson.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/630142d6f0a7a740a74851850a82720ecc1a29bd/37_0_2411_1446/master/2411.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6dbbb739c429b3bfc1ea503f1cbf566","title":"rare uk wildlife thriving in lockdown reveals national trust","story":"Orca, cuckoo and peregrine falcon some of species enjoying breathing space of quieter worldFirst came the goats. During the first days of lockdown the bearded, ghostly white creatures wandered down from their north Wales clifftop home into the town of Llandudno and made headlines around the globe.Now the National Trust is reporting that emboldened wildlife, from raptors and warblers to badgers, otters and even orcas, appear to be enjoying the disappearance of humans from its gardens, castles and waterways across the UK.The charity is asking people to be aware that when they eventually return to the countryside they should take care not to disturb wildlife they would not usually expect to encounter.Reports from rangers and gardeners include peregrine falcons nesting in the ancient ruins of Corfe Castle in Dorset, English partridges rootling around an empty car park near Cambridge, and a cuckoo calling at Osterley Park in west London, having not been heard there for 20 yearsDavid Brown, the National Trust’s ecologist at Corfe Castle, said: “This is the first time peregrines have nested here since the 1980s. With the site the quietest it has ever been, the great curtain walls are an ideal spot for these birds, which look for isolated and inaccessible places to build a nest. Amongst all the uncertainty, it has been heartening to see nature colonising the landscape in our absence.”At Plas yn Rhiw, a manor house on the Llyn Peninsula in north Wales, stoats, weasels and hares have come in from the woodland to explore the gardens, which are usually filled with visitors.In Norfolk, a buzzard managed to get into the orangery at Felbrigg Hall and happily tucked into its lunch there. At the Ashridge estate in Hertfordshire, the rare sound of a grasshopper warbler was recorded in a typically busy dog-walking area.Little owls have also been making their presence felt at Ham House in south-west London, venturing into the garden from the adjacent river meadows.Some creatures appear to be missing human visitors, however.Jackdaws, which enjoy feeding on scraps of food dropped by people, for example, have not returned to Ham House since the lockdown. And with no audience to show off to, the peacocks at Powis Castle, in mid-Wales, have taken to following gardeners on their daily rounds.But the overall picture is positive. A family of badger cubs has been spotted playfully exploring the Mount Stewart estate in Northern Ireland by daylight, while a rare albino badger has been seen in the woods at Cliveden, in Berkshire.On Friday, two male orca were seen in Strangford Lough, in Northern Ireland. They are believed to have belonged to a pod of just eight animals, the UK’s only resident group. They spend much of their time in the Inner and Outer Hebrides and the western seaboard of Scotland. It may be that the quietness of the lough during lockdown tempted them in.Otters have been spotted enjoying the quiet at Nunnington Hall in Yorkshire and at Mount Stewart in County Down, with those at the Northern Ireland site travelling from the lough to explore the lake in the grounds of the neoclassical house.Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said: “It has only been eight weeks but wildlife seems to be enjoying the breathing space. With less traffic and fewer people, we’ve heard deafening levels of birdsong and seen famous monuments and formal gardens colonised by wildlife.”While its properties are temporarily closed, the trust is working on its reopening plans.As it begins to welcome back visitors to its countryside and coastal sites, however, the conservation charity is asking people to be particularly careful not to disturb wildlife that may have moved into typically busy areas.McCarthy added: “As the lockdown begins to be eased, we all need to play our part to ensure that this wildlife remains undisturbed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf64a2273c23896b6449c5e1ea542a17629482d4/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c028f9a1bc0cb45b643978a1d057eb2e","title":"relax to the sounds of british wildlife","story":"Our interactive takes you on an audiovisual journey through a lush forest across the course of a dayAs the coronavirus crisis and lockdown still thwart most of our social plans, many of us are looking to escape feelings of cabin fever and the perennial cycle of bad news by reconnecting with nature.Perhaps you are taking more notice of your natural surroundings these days, or you have seen animals move into the spaces that humans have vacated.But what if you could enjoy some of that natural beauty from the safety of your home?Our interactive experience takes you on a journey through a lush forest in spring and lets you listen to the sounds of iconic British wildlife. The samples were collected by prolific wildlife recordist Lawrence Shove in the 1960s and 1970s and provided to the  by the British Library. This interactive is best experienced with your sound on. As we wake up to an early start around sunrise, many birds are already up and singing at full throat to stake off their territory and attract potential mates.The nightingale likes to hide in thick brush when delivering its powerful song. It can be heard between April and June and is most active at dawn and dusk.The robin is a pugnacious little bird that will try to maintain its territory throughout the year.Fallow deer often stalk the forest at dawn before lying down to ruminate during the day. They give off powerful bellows to establish dominance or signal alarm. Around midday, the forest gets quieter as birds and other small animals are cautious not to attract the attention of predators. But not all animals fall silent … The woodpecker’s distinctive drumming can often be heard during the day. The woodpecker uses its drumming like other birds use their song: to attract mates, defend a territory or summon help.The great tit is known for its vast repertoire of short calls.The grey squirrel spends much of the day scavenging for nuts, fruit and fungi. It will give off loud alarm calls when spotting a predator. As the sun goes down, more animals can be heard stirring in the undergrowth again.  The red fox is an extremely adaptive species not afraid of exploring gardens or farmland. Its diet includes rodents, insects, fruit and vegetables – and sometimes scraps found in the garbage. The elusive pine marten is a close relative of the weasel and critically endangered in England and Wales. It is a stealthy, acrobatic hunter that likes to venture out at dusk. The mole is active for about four hours at a time and then rests for a similar amount of time. It makes shrill chirping noises when alarmed. Many animals awake only after nightfall to move or hunt under cover of darkness. The badger emerges from its underground home after dusk to feed on worms, birds’ eggs or small animals. It is a highly social animal and communicates through chortling sounds. The tawny owl glides almost soundlessly through the night as it looks for prey. The male gives off an eerie hoot when attempting to court a nearby female. Finally, we hear a hedgehog snuffling as it moves through the undergrowth. The hedgehog can also become surprisingly noisy during its lengthy mating ritual. If you enjoyed this interactive, you might find that some of these animals live right on your doorstep.If you decide to exercise outdoors, remember that the government’s coronavirus advice is to stay at home as much as possible.

When different minority groups stand up and stand together, there is an astounding level of support that can change the tides for a more equitable and peaceful future.”It is a potent message, in the climate of racially based Covid incidents and Donald Trump labelling the pandemic the “Chinese virus”. “Assigning a race to this virus is exactly the type of misinformation we have to fight against to ensure we are well informed,” says Gurung. Lim agrees that the incendiary language around Covid is having a toxic effect. “It is frustrating to watch the leaders of this country blatantly gaslight the American public with this type of xenophobic rhetoric,” he says.“I genuinely believe that most people want to do good,” says Gurung. “That said, I was not surprised by the racism. While I see the incredible beauty of this country, I have always been aware of the cracks in its foundation and the systemic racism that pulses under the surface.”Gurung has been political in his work before. He sent models down the runway with statement T-shirts featuring slogans such as “The future is female” and “Our bodies, our choices, our power” and “I am an immigrant”. He stopped his 10th anniversary New York fashion week show being held at Hudson Yards when he found out that the owner hosted a Trump fundraiser. Provocatively, in the era of Trump’s immigration ban, his SpringSummer 20 show featured a erse cast of models wearing prom-like sashes asking: “Who gets to be American?”.He said the idea for the collection came to him while he was in a business meeting. “I was sitting across from a group of businessmen, telling them about my goal to redefine the Americana aesthetic, and one of them said: ‘You don’t look American, so how can you define what America is?’” He said this exchange, along with Time magazine’s Who Gets To Be American cover, set off the central idea for the collection.“The sashes were a powerful visual moment, with all these erse models from all over the world representing the different possible identities and stories of living the American dream,” he says, adding that the collection was about “questioning who gets to claim that identity in today’s climate”.This political moment in fashion also marks a generational shift. “In Asian culture, our parents tell us to keep our heads down,” says Lim. “Don’t make problems and ignore racism so that it will just go away it’s so ingrained in our subconscious as a means of survival. In our current situation, that mentality has the opposite effect. Being quiet strips away your right for a voice and it takes away the opportunity to be seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd0d59e31fc8cb0f504f314541d33729b974db53/0_147_3695_2216/master/3695.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0d106f1bb3a5313d420103729a57cff8","title":"peter gallagher one of the most toxic things in the world is success","story":"The actor on 40 years in show business, why he channelled Donald Trump in American Beauty – and having a face that makes directors sickThe director Robert Altman used to tell Peter Gallagher, the suave star of his 1992 movie The Player: “Gallagher, you’re so good-looking it makes me sick.” To hear Gallagher impersonating the gruff auteur, it was not quite a compliment. But he was used to that.During a heated rehearsal for The Real Thing, Gallagher’s breakout role on Broadway at the age of 29, another director, Mike Nichols, admitted to not being able to stand the sight of him. “And we were close!” says Gallagher cheerfully, speaking over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. He responded by growing an “awful white goatee” until Nichols pleaded for him to shave.Critiques of Gallagher’s performance often linger on his looks. They seem integral to the cocksure ne’er-do-wells he plays: from a vengeful spouse in Altman’s Short Cuts, to a lawyer sleeping with his wife’s sister in Sex, Lies and Videotape, to the braggadocious “real estate king” in American Beauty. Altman said he cast Gallagher as a shortcut to character, just his face communicating “handsome, vain, sleazy”.Even at 64, Gallagher continues to play bad guys: an absent father in the sitcom New Girl, a three-time orcee and white-collar criminal in Netflix’s Grace and Frankie. “It has a lot to do with how I look,” he agrees. “When I was younger, I had the kind of face that if I saw me walking down the street, I’d say: ‘What an asshole! Look at that rich kid who’s had everything handed to him! Fuck him!’”Yet Gallagher has little in common with his privileged parts. From working-class Irish-Catholic stock, he carved out a 40-year career in show business by “showing up”, he says. “The only thing I know is you’ve got to be willing to work harder than everybody else.” Even now, quarantining at home, Gallagher is practising singing daily, so as to “not completely go to seed”.The character he seems most like is Sandy Cohen, the statesmanly patriarch of the 00s teen-dramedy The OC, one of television’s greatest-ever dads. “After Bill Cosby fell a few spots …” he jokes drily. As a father, to film-maker James and musician Kathryn, Gallagher says: “I try to be Sandy Cohen. I never, ever wanted my kids to see me angry, because I know that anger just stops a kid. It chokes everything off.”Gallagher’s own childhood was characterised by that emotional instability. “The impression was we were always sort of living on the edge.” He was born in New York City in 1955, the unplanned youngest of three. He was close to his mother, a bacteriologist, but for much of his childhood she suffered from social anxiety and depression, which he connects to her parents’ experience of emigrating to the US from Ireland. “She would be unable to get out of bed, and I had to take care of her.”Gallagher’s parents, both of whom are dead, fought constantly. He remembers, at age six, seeing the family’s brand-new television sailing through the air. “I used to pray for them to get orced, it was just so noisy sometimes.”Later, as an adult, he saw the love between them, and “that there was grace to be maybe had, if you stayed the course”. That has informed his own marriage, to Paula Harwood, a former producer turned interior designer, whom he met in his first year at Tufts University in Massachusetts. This month they mark their 37th wedding anniversary, which is, says Gallagher, “embarrassing for Hollywood”.But his relationship with his father – a second world war veteran and advertising executive – casts a long shadow. Gallagher describes a distant, dismissive figure. “I would try my whole life to reach him, just to get him to respond to me. ‘Dad, what were you in the war?’ ‘A general. Now go clean the gutters.’ ‘Dad, what are taxes?’ ‘You’ll figure it out.’”Young Gallagher took his father’s indifference as a personal failing. In his career – he says, in that cogent way that comes with therapy – he sought out surrogates such as Nichols, Altman and his co-stars Jack Lemmon and Peter O’Toole. Lemmon gave Gallagher a set of golf clubs. O’Toole took him to a football game.On stage, following a script, Gallagher felt liberated, finally confident he “wasn’t doing anything wrong”. In fact, he was getting enough right to land the part of Danny Zuko in Grease on Broadway, from an open audition in 1978. Yet he was not immune from the fickleness of show business. He notes the irony of “the best creative experience I ever had” – 1984’s The Real Thing, alongside Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons – precipitating his quarter-life crisis of confidence. Despite all his promise, opportunities dried up. Now Gallagher blames his agent then it coalesced with his “self-loathing, lack of confidence” and childhood trauma. “I started to question every morsel of my being until I couldn’t really function.”Even in his depression, Gallagher recognised he was at a “transition point … I could keep banging my head against the wall and have a tragic outcome – or pay attention to what was going on inside.” He quit the play and started over, with therapy and acting classes. “It was like a key into a lock.”Focusing on the craft allowed Gallagher to distance himself from the outcome – for better and worse. What he identifies as his career low, the 1992 Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls, was a critical and commercial hit. But Gallagher felt boxed in by the director, prevented from giving his best that “rough treatment” led him to avoid musicals for 25 years.“When something works in show business, it’s a miracle,” says Gallagher – so he has little time for big egos making it harder. Seeing someone get fired on a film set “just for a power thing” made a lasting impression. “One of the most toxic things in the world is success. I’ve seen people think they have all the answers, like: ‘If I’ve succeeded at this, then there’s nothing I can’t succeed at!’ You want to say: ‘Dude – you’re a member of the effin’ lucky club.’”Besides, he says: “I think the whole idea of stardom is kind of baloney I never really bought into it. I wouldn’t have had the skills, the way of thinking … I’ve seen the people who have achieved it, and what they’ve done to get there.”There is more freedom to being a character actor, he says more scope to surprise. The benefit to playing bad guys is that the parts were often underwritten. “They just wanted him to be an asshole … so it gave me a little elbow room,” says Gallagher. In the 1995 romcom While You Were Sleeping, he resisted the writers’ attempt to zhoosh up his character by making him an “awful person”, instead of just poorly suited to Sandra Bullock. “Why burden the audience with someone to hate? There’s just more opportunity in playing the character truthfully.”For all the writers’ occasional “capriciousness”, Gallagher says The OC was successful because of “the organism of the ensemble” – and the timing. Post 911 the US had “run with the wrong ball”, closing borders and embracing xenophobia, “the most cowardly, un-American thing”. Sandy Cohen was a corrective: a principled public defender, a New York Jew married to a gentile Californian, “not afraid to welcome others into his home. I thought that was the perfect story to be telling.”Gallagher sees parallels with his latest project, Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, which just concluded its first season on NBC (E4 in the UK). In the whimsical musical dramedy, Zoey hears others’ private thoughts as songs – highlighting, for Gallagher, the importance of a sympathetic ear “in an era when we’ve been intentionally ided”.The Trump presidency has special significance for born-and-bred New Yorkers, he says sombrely. “We knew his father was a white supremacist,” he says, but they didn’t take Donald seriously until his attacks on the Central Park Five, a group of black teenagers who were wrongly convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman. “We realised he was no longer funny there was a darkness, and a willingness to do harm.”Still, it was a “no-brainer” to look to Trump for Buddy Kane, Gallagher’s ludicrous character in American Beauty: “I thought, who has the hugest opinion of themselves in real estate?” Gallagher was made heavier and older, and approximated the “pouffey thing going on” with an old wig of Cary Grant’s. “So when I was in bed with Annette Bening, Cary Grant was on top of her.”Twenty years on, it is “heartbreaking”, says Gallagher, to see the country “bamboozled by this con man … It really feels like they left the back door of the Capitol open.” He mimes a bandit, egging others on. “Take anything you can and get the hell out before they catch on! You want the parks?”And amid coronavirus, the stakes have never been higher. Gallagher winces: “It’s a little painful, having been raised by a bacteriologist mother, to hear someone blatantly disregarding science.” His mother had helped to develop the Romansky formula during the second world war, revolutionising the administration of penicillin. She died in 2004 after a 20-year struggle with Alzheimer’s disease.The experience informed his role in Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist he plays Zoey’s father, who is paralysed by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a somewhat similar brain disease. “What gave me some relief was that PSP doesn’t always find the same expression in people,” says Gallagher. The series creator, Austin Winsberg, whose father died of PSP, was also a check. “I knew that if I was screwing it up, he’d go: ‘No!’ And if he was leaving because he had to cry, I thought: ‘I’m in the ballpark.’”Gallagher has been gratified by praise from people with experience of PSP, or of caring for a parent – but some criticised his casting, as an able-bodied actor. What is his view: that disabled parts should go to disabled actors? That there is a limit to the experience that can be portrayed by acting? Gallagher flips the question: “I would say, people with disabilities shouldn’t be automatically excluded from playing any role.” He notes that one episode features deaf actors and musical numbers in sign language. And “hard and fast rules about who should do what” do not recognise the hurdles a project has to clear in order to get made, he says, with mounting (and somewhat surprising) impatience.The answer, as he sees it, is more, and more erse stories – and by that measure progress is fast. He points to Grace and Frankie, in which he plays Jane Fonda’s love interest. “What an extraordinarily disruptive notion: people older than 25 have life experience that deserves investigation and sharing!” he says with good-natured sarcasm. “And, my God – there are people 25 and under that want to watch!”It is the chance to be part of those stories that have “a place in the world” that keeps Gallagher singing his scales in quarantine and, he believes, will see show business through the challenge of coronavirus. “Broadway was supposed to be over with 911 it turned out to be exactly what the world needed. And what are people doing in quarantine? They’re watching a lot of Netflix. Because these stories are important.”And even the bad guys have a part. Days after 911, Gallagher was asked to go to Ground Zero to boost the morale of emergency workers who had missed out on visits from the president and the Yankees. “The fires were still burning, the smell of death …” Gallagher’s last big picture had been American Beauty. “I’m thinking: ‘What have I done with my life? I’ve got to change jobs, do something that counts.” And all of a sudden, one of the firefighters …” Gallagher erupts in a New-Yoik holler. “‘LOOK WHO’S HERE! ‘FUCK ME, YOUR MAJESTY’, IT’S THE KING!’”Buddy Kane was an asshole. But they were still glad to see him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a35af141e25dd4cef06d8eb0cbf8243f4da36e/0_69_4832_2898/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0ecb05ea6674e1ce22636b158c0eace","title":"michel piccoli a life in pictures","story":"The prolific actor Michel Piccoli, who has died aged 94, acted in dozens of films for virtually every major French director across seven decades, including Godard, Malle and Rivette here are some of the highlightsPeter Bradshaw on Michel Piccoli: a fierce, strong performer who became the object of cinephile fan-worship"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206a42f178655b73d1e49824b7707943709d7102/0_1534_4905_2941/master/4905.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=51a5124e7832196c28b60b19ff0e4380","title":"have any football champions gone out of business faster than hallelujah fc the knowledge","story":"Plus: long gaps between players winning the same trophy, the ultimate leisurely pro and Demeaco Duhaney’s ups and downs“Hallelujah FC, who were the first professional club in South Korea, won the inaugural K-League in 1983,” writes Kári Tulinius. “Two years later they had ceased to be professional, and continued as an amateur club until 1998, when they were dissolved. Despite the name, they were never resurrected. Has any professional club been permanently dissolved so soon after being champion?”It turns out there are plenty of examples of champions who have tumbled into oblivion in double-quick time. “There are quite a few in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states,” writes Jack Mey. “Unirea Urziceni won the league title in Romania in 2009. By the end of the 2010-11 season, they had been relegated and were subsequently wound up. In Estonia, Lantana Tallinn won the league title twice, in 1996 and 1997. The club was disbanded in 1999. Over the border in Latvia, FK Vindava from the city of Ventspils, won the Latvian Championship in 2007 before being dissolved in 2009. FK Ekranas were one of Lithuania’s most successful clubs, they won the last of seven titles in 2012 and were wound up in 2014.”John Morrow takes us to the Emerald Isle. “It has been a regular occurrence in the volatile League of Ireland, especially in Cork, where the predominance of Dublin clubs in the league meant crippling travel expenses. Cork United emerged in 1940 after the dissolution of Cork City (a separate entity to the current League of Ireland members) and took the league by storm, winning three consecutive titles and adding two more in 1945 and 1946. A mere two years later, however, and they too were gone. Dolphin were a Dublin club who won the title in 1935 but resigned in 1937, unable to compete with the more established city clubs.”Dean Whearty has another League of Ireland example. “Sporting Fingal – founded in 2007 and dissolved in 2011 – had 965 days between their first and last match. In that time, they won the domestic cup, won promotion to the top ision (finishing fourth in their one and only season) and lost a dramatic Europa League tie 6-4 to Maritimo.”But Dave Mellinger can offer us two champion clubs who disappeared so quickly their crowning wins were mere whispers in the wind. “In 2009 in the top tier of US WPS, the Los Angeles Sol won the regular season, which ended on 9 August. This being the States, there was also a playoff winner, but we’ll ignore them for now. Before the next season started, the team was dissolved – on 28 January 2010, only 172 days later. The Sol were tortoises, however, compared to what happened next. The following season, FC Gold Pride won the playoff championship on 26 September 2010 – they had won the regular season shortly before – and folded, never to be resurrected, on 16 November of the same year. That’s a hare-like 51 days between the championship and dissolution.”“Edwin van der Sar won the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 and Manchester United in 2008. Has any other player had a longer gap between winning the same major trophy?” asks Todd Bonzalez.Geoff Edwards has found another former Manchester United goalkeeper who can pip Van der Sar: “Jimmy Rimmer was (an admittedly unused) substitute to Alex Stepney in 1968 and Aston Villa’s No 1 in their 1982 European Cup victory, so a gap of 14 years.”Jonathan Churchill offers up an FA Cup winner, pointing out that David O’Leary won it with Arsenal in 1979 and again in 1993, but Dirk Maas has found a winner in longevity’s Paolo Mandini. The Milan legend won the Intercontinental Cup in 1989 and 1990, then waited 17 years to win it again, when called the Fifa Club World Cup.“After he was mentioned last week, I looked up Hans Segers and was interested to see that he had played Premier League football with Wimbledon, Conference football with Woking, then Premier League football again with Tottenham,” notes Ricardo Sentulio. “Can any other player claim to have dipped even lower to play a competitive match between spells in a top flight?”“Not quite what you are looking for, but Demeaco Duhaney made his professional debut in the Premier League for Huddersfield in a 1-0 win against Wolves in 2019,” begins Richard Askham. “He was substituted at half-time with an injury that kept him out until this season. His second professional appearance was on loan for Boston United in National League North, five down from the top flight (four from where Town are now). He’s played once in the Championship (against Leeds) for Town since returning from Boston. If he isn’t selected again in 2019-20 and Town are relegated, his first appearance in League One would be a proper (albeit unwanted) record. Surely a record of sorts and a question in its own right, perhaps? Please ask if anyone can ‘beat’ Demeaco’s ups and downs, (with respect to Boston, who were in the same ision as Town in 2003-04).”“After an obscure discussion I ended up on the Wikipedia page of former Liverpool and Leicester goalkeeper Pegguy Arphexad who, it says, made 39 appearances in a 16-year career,” begins Neal Robb. “I thought this must be a record and checked back to see if this had been a topic and I see from this Knowledge article on the fewest appearances in a professional career that Stuart Taylor’s 86 was the lowest found.”It would appear you do indeed have a new leading leisurely pro, Neal. Transfermarkt has Arphexad’s career appearances at 46 and Soccerbase at 49. He “played” for 16 years so either of those figures make Taylor look like an overworked stopper. Despite Arphexad’s aversion to actually starting games, he can still boast these medals:“Steven Gerrard famously kissed a mobile camera after scoring at Old Trafford but has anyone else done this before him?” asks Tim Underwood.“At Porto, Paulo Ferreira won the Uefa Cup in 2003 and the Champions League in 2004. Later, at Chelsea, he won the Champions League in 2012 and the Europa League (aka the Uefa Cup) in 2013. Are there any other cases of players winning these two trophies in successive years, twice?” wonders Benjamin Dom.“Which two clubs have done the most transfer business with each other?” enquires John Ruddock.“Has a player has ever featured in all their team’s wins in a season, but none of the losses?

The trio are among six iniduals across three Premier League clubs to have tested positive for Covid-19 in the first round of top-flight testing, with the Burnley assistant manager, Ian Woan, the only person identified as having done so.Watford have been one of the most outspoken clubs regarding plans to restart the Premier League in June. The squad are due return to training on Wednesday but the captain, Troy Deeney, said he would not participate and the manager, Nigel Pearson, raised concerns about a coronavirus-related death in the league.Watford said all three club members would isolate for seven days before being tested again, in line with Premier League guidelines.This week Deeney said he had raised questions at a meeting involving the league and captains and had not been satisfied it was safe to train. “We’re due back in this week I’ve said I’m not going,” he told Eddie Hearn and Tony Bellew on their Talk the Talk YouTube show. “Within the meeting I asked very simple questions. For Black, Asian and mixed ethnicities they are four times more likely to get the illness and twice as likely to have long-lasting illness. Is there any additional screening? Heart stuff, to see if anyone has a problem?“I feel that should be addressed. I can’t get a haircut until mid-July but I can go and get in a box with 19 people and jump for a header? I don’t know how that works. No one could answer the questions – not because they didn’t want to, because they didn’t have the information. I just said: ‘If you don’t know the information, why would I put myself at risk?’”Pearson told the Times in an article published last Saturday: “God forbid we have a fatality. People are closing their eyes to the threat. Yes, we would like to restart it but it’s got to be safe. We should be cautious. To ignore possibilities is foolhardy. It’s about safeguarding people’s health.”Premier League protocols have been drawn up in consultation with the government and health officials. Covid-19 tests were conducted on 748 players and staff at 19 clubs on Sunday and Monday and the 20th club completed testing on Tuesday their figures will be in the results from a second round of testing, due to be published on Saturday.Burnley said of Woan: “Ian is asymptomatic and is currently safe and well at home.” Premier League clubs were allowed to resume training, on a physically distanced basis, on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe412c5eca3f65fd886b7e8f1f013f61a432b2e/0_49_2449_1469/master/2449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=755f96751645b6415fdda33abc3add6d","title":"can virtual reality help get you through lockdown","story":"From global exploration or robot warfare to virtual family get-togethers, a VR headset could offer an alternative to going outRight now, it feels as if there is no escape. We’re stuck at home for most of the day, our only respite coming from the odd stroll around the block.But make a list of the things you miss most from your pre-lockdown life and chances are you can probably do some form of them in virtual reality. From travelling abroad to exercising outside, and even visiting friends, it’s all possible if you’re willing to strap on a headset.There are alternatives. PlayStation VR (£260) plugs into a PS4 console and provides a decent though comparatively low resolution experience with a really vast range of games, including platformer Astro Bot Rescue Mission and epic space exploration sim No Man’s Sky.Being freed from a bulky PC opens up the possibilities of VR as a casual home entertainment option. It means you can sit on your sofa (or in bed) and explore space or climb a mountain while your partner is watching TV. Over the past fortnight I’ve been happily trawling YouTube, Amazon and Oculus for short 360-degree VR movies (mostly available for free), and have spent many happy minutes swimming with sharks and gatecrashing LA pool parties. Quest has also made energetic games like the excellent Beat Saber and SuperHot feel safer because you’re not worried about tripping over a cable that’s coming out of your head. Apps such as AltSpaceVR have also let me meet strangers with weird avatars in virtual hangouts, which has been as unsettling as it sounds.Recently, I may have taken my interest in VR technology a bit far by accepting a Roto VR Chair on loan from British tech startup Roto VR. It looks like a sports car seat mounted on a circular plinth, but it comes with an ingenious head-tracking device that you attach to your VR headset so that the chair rotates in the direction you’re looking.At first the movement is rather unsettling, but as you get used to it, it adds a rather wonderful sense of being physically present in a world, which is perfect for virtual tourism apps as well as multidirectional games such as Robo Recall. The head-tracking rotation is also meant to cut down on VR motion sickness because it reduces the disparity between the screened activity and our body’s sense of where it is and what it’s doing. (There are also foot pedals to control forward and backward movement, although few games currently support this feature.) It’s expensive at $999 (£800) – Roto VR says most of its pre-orders have been from universities, businesses and arcades – but perhaps if the lockdown goes on much longer, many more living rooms will have one.Even without a revolving chair, VR games and experiences are now providing a true sense of “presence”, the holy grail of the technology – and for a few minutes every day, I have genuinely forgotten that I’m standing alone in the living room in my pyjamas swinging my arms about.Here are some of our favourite lockdown apps for VR:Everest VR: Journey to the Top of the World (Oculus TV Oculus and Samsung Gear VR)Jaw-on-the-floor VR documentary with crisp visuals.

This cardio fitness app will transport you to stunning photorealistic landscapes for a workout. Put on a fan to feel the breeze, as you bop to pacey daily routines, each accompanied with energising music. We tried it out before launch – it’s a tremendous amount of fun and very sweaty. Similar to Peloton, Supernatural has a library of on-demand fitness programmes. New sessions are released every day, each with a virtual coach who hovers in front of you.The Climb (Crytek Oculus Quest and Rift)A thrilling rock-climbing simulator, which feels surprisingly similar to the real-life experience, with players having to select the best route and regularly apply chalk to their hands. Best to do short sessions as you might get a little queasy. Oh, and don’t look down.Surprisingly decent flight simulator considering the current limitations of VR graphics. Island-hop from airport to airport in a microlight, glider or aerobatic plane.Several VR apps offer the option of playing films, but none recreate the full experience of heading to the movies like this one. With several blockbusters playing at any one time, enter a cinema lobby with friends and see what’s on. Spillable popcorn and soda included.Rec Room is your go-to app for fun group activities. The visuals are undoubtedly cartoonish, but when you’re splurting off rounds in a paintball game or playing virtual dodgeball with others around the world, you’ll soon forget. Also included are escape rooms, although maybe lockdown is already claustrophobic enough.Some of you might even be missing the office by now (ahem, parents?) Job Simulator goes some way to recreate the experience of pre-pandemic employment. Don’t be put off, though, it’s not for workaholics. If you like, you can spend your time throwing coffee mugs at the boss.A nature exploration and relaxation app recommended to us by VR developer Sam Watts of Make Real: “It has a series of calming interactive scenes you can chill out in and influence, with a yoga breathing mode.”Basically, the VR version of experimental virtual world Second Life, now sold by Linden Lab but still in development by much of the same team. “Great if you’re looking for more realistic graphics,” says Dan Page of VR firm Opposable Group. “Its major focus right now is music, but there are all sorts of socials and podcast recordings that regularly take place on the platform.”A brilliantly designed and truly engrossing VR take on the award-winning smartphone puzzle game series, where you explore an archaeological museum deciphering hidden codes and unlocking intricate devices.The long-awaited new addition to the legendary sci-fi shooter series is an absolutely stunning showcase of virtual reality technology, putting you right in the middle of humanity’s fight against alien invaders.Other games to tryWe also recommend: ridiculous comedy romp Accounting+ surreal wildlife adventure Paper Beast heartwarming action puzzler Moss the atmospheric Star Wars demo Vader Immortal and the frenzied multiplayer co-op experiences, Star Trek Bridge Crew, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes and Spaceteam.

Sunday’s episode saw couple Stephanie Matto and Erika Owens hash out what went wrong in their failed relationship, and some viewers suggested that a screenshot showing an exchange between them might sum their problems up.“I’m so sad about this,” Owens texts Matto, seen in a WhatsApp chat. Then she adds: “I feel so lead on.”There are a select number of situations in which someone is allowed to correct someone else’s grammar: if you are a teacher if you are paid to correct grammar or proofread work or if you are a parent. Then it’s acceptable to say: “Actually, it’s you’re, not your.”In some cases, the question is blurrier. Perhaps you’re learning a new language, and you have either asked, or the other person assumes, that you’d appreciate not looking silly every time you get something wrong. If you are a waiter and your boss corrects your grammar because they’re worried about the impression you give off, or if you’re the nanny to someone’s children and the parents are worried you’ll impart incorrect wisdom … then it becomes a little more subjective.Some might say that if good grammar isn’t in the job description, it shouldn’t count it could certainly end up feeling like an overreach of someone’s power if they continue to correct you.But if you correct someone’s grammar in the middle of an argument, even if you are in any of the above positions, you are most likely wrong. Sure, they may have meant fewer, rather than less. But it is both a power move and a way of detracting from what the person is saying, of putting them down instead of listening to the substance of their argument. Slate summed up exactly what’s wrong with this when it coined the term “language bully” in 2013. There’s nothing wrong with knowing more than others, writer Matthew Malady wrote, but “those who use their advanced knowledge to embarrass or humiliate others are the absolute worst”.If correcting someone else’s grammar is routine for you, consider this: are you genuinely trying to help, or are you just trying to gain the upper hand? Are you listening to what the other person is saying, or simply looking for an excuse to show them that they are wrong? And really, does it matter that they confused their and there, or could you let that one go this time?

To nobody’s surprise more than mine, my pandemic experience so far has been fine. More than fine.As someone who has lived alone and worked from home for years, I expected that in some ways self-isolation would be easier for me than for others. However, as someone with major depression, the lack of human contact and a sharp decline in work also spelled potential disaster. But disaster never came. Or hasn’t come (I shouldn’t count my chickens). I mean, I’m anxious about money, worried about the refugees I advocate for and terrified for all humankind, but that’s all in a normal day for me. Compared with the utter trainwreck forecast by my mental health history, I’m going well. Killing it, even.Part of the answer is that I’ve continued seeing my sister and her family on limited, socially distanced occasions throughout lockdown. As boring and entitled as it sounds, daily yoga and exercise help too. But perhaps the biggest reason for my shockingly stable mood is increased contact with my friends, near and far.Before coronavirus (BC) I only saw a handful of friends with even semi-regularity. With jobs, kids, sea-changes and sheer laziness, phone calls are hard. One-on-one catch-ups harder, and group events near impossible. And though I’m super close to my family, when I’m not dating someone I can feel quite isolated. Even when I am dating someone. The virus has changed that. Even though I’ve hardly seen a soul in-person for months, in a way I’ve never felt less alone.Ever since this collective nightmare started, I’ve barely gone a day without a video call or two. There’s no way to say that without sounding like I’m bragging about having friends – so just know, I know.In the past, self-consciousness has seen me decline all video calls, personal and professional. It’s seen me decline a lot of things, actually – I barely let anyone take my photo. I’d make excuses about my laptop camera being broken or the wifi being too unreliable, or I’d just flat out say no. But, through self-administered immersion therapy, I faced my fears and it’s opened up a whole new world.Hanging out with mates without having to leave the house or wear pants is amazing. And it only took a global pandemic for me to realise this.Now seeing my phone light up with an incoming FaceTime call no longer paralyses me with dread. I’m having regular Zooms with friends all over the world. I’ve had cocktail parties, we’ve done trivia and group yoga together and taken live dance classes. I’ve advised on outfits, read bedtime stories and had Passover with my extended family.Embracing video-telephony has enabled me to be there for my friends in a more present and meaningful way. When a friend was having relationship problems, we had a video call. I felt a thousand times more helpful than I would have had we just texted, which is what we would have done before.When another friend lost her job, an all-too-familiar tale right now, a group of us were able to cheer her up, at least briefly, by being silly on Zoom. It’s a strange comfort to know that if I break – still a very real possibility – they’ll watch me cry and do stupid dances in their underwear for me too.Of course, there’s no substitute for spending time with your favourite people in the same place. And as the rules relax, I’m excited to see my friends without the NBN causing their faces to freeze mid-sentence. I’m excited about hugs. I’m excited about patting dogs, playing with my godsons and sharing meals.If I could go back in time and reverse the decisions that got us into, worsened and prolonged this horrific mess, I would. Especially all the ones to do with cruise ships, the sick bays of the sea.But if I can pinpoint even the faintest of silver linings on this gigantic black dot, it’s the lesson that I really do get by with a little help from my friends, and a lot of help from telecommunications technology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84dd40a4b177c134f055219326f426176529b948/0_218_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52fd3db8413811d6b8fe3c7baec4f7b3","title":"bbc three could return as broadcast channel under proposals","story":"BBC’s annual plan to more than double channel’s budget over next two yearsBBC Three could make a triumphant return as a broadcast TV channel after enjoying a run of hits – from Fleabag to lockdown obsession Normal People – that have rated with the youth audience the corporation is desperate to win over.The corporation is actively exploring reviving the broadcast channel, four years after it was taken online-only, according to the BBC’s annual plan due to be published on Wednesday.Regardless of what is decided, the channel will have its programme budget more than double to £80m over the next two years. This bulking up will mean it is able to commission enough programming for a linear TV schedule, but will entail cuts elsewhere in the corporation.The annual plan, which sets out the BBC’s intentions for the next financial year, says the corporation has turned around the slide of youth audiences trickling away to other services such as Netflix.Two years ago the corporation said it faced a crisis over reaching younger audiences, revealing that 16- to 24-year-olds spent more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer.“BBC Three has become home to some of our biggest shows,” said a BBC source. “We need to back that success, so within an environment where we are making difficult cuts, this is one of a limited number of areas where we will seek to invest. Who wouldn’t want more Fleabags, Killing Eves, This Country or Normal People?”Earlier this month, Normal People, which the corporation says has now had more than 38m requests to view it on the iPlayer, helped deliver the best week ever for BBC Three as TV viewing soared under lockdown conditions.The annual plan will point to BBC research that shows there is still a big available audience on broadcast television. The huge success of digital channel ITV2’s in attracting millions of younger viewers to Love Island is a case in point that has not gone unnoticed at the BBC.One executive at the corporation said BBC Three “has been a real hit machine … but it’s also reaching the wider population as well.”The channel’s new budget will be almost twice that of BBC Four’s £44m, as rumours circulate that the arts and culture channel could face the threat of closure.BBC Four attracts a small, niche audience of mostly older viewers to its schedule of shows, although it was responsible for creating the hit comedy The Thick of It. The corporation has made it clear that its goal is to pursue younger audiences.Speculation intensified earlier this month when it was announced that Cassian Harrison, BBC Four’s long-serving controller, is to move to BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm, on a nine-month attachment.While the annual plan does not explicitly protect the future of BBC Four, sources say a closure is not on the cards.“This is not about playing off BBC Four against BBC Three,” said a BBC source. “Contrary to reports, the BBC has no plans to close it or diminish our arts portfolio.”The annual plan will also address the negative impact the pandemic is having on the corporation’s finances. The BBC has predicted its income will fall by £125m this year as people stop paying the licence fee during the coronavirus pandemic and as revenue from its commercial arm drops substantially.A source says the corporation will set out plans on how to “balance its books” in the autumn as a result, once the full financial impact of the coronavirus is clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20a460ac5941995f56754ff80b402239b0ce41a2/8_245_2707_1624/master/2707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e81d41677c5407df9e4ec15cc38431","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 13 frankie goes to hollywood relax","story":"Amid 80s homophobia and repression, this gleeful banger about banging thrust its way to the top of the charts, its success boosted by a BBC ban In 1983, Margaret Thatcher swept to general election victory on a moralistic platform of “Victorian values”. The Victorians are well-remembered for their culture of sexual repression, and – as a direct result – their obsession with sex and erotica. So perhaps Thatcher should have seen it coming: mere months later, the country’s No 1 single was the most gloriously filthy in chart-topping history.Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Relax, the ultimate banger about banging, made little impact on its first release on ZTT Records in late 1983. But after a performance on Top of the Pops in January 1984, it shot to the top of the charts and stayed there for five weeks, beginning a year of total chart dominance for the Liverpool group. It remains the sixth bestselling single in British history, beaten only by Band Aid, Candle in the Wind, Bohemian Rhapsody and some novelty songs. Its immense success proves that, besides charity, nothing brings the UK together quite like extreme horniness.With not only its flagrant innuendo, but its wide-open synths, and swooning, psychedelic disco structure, the song was a complete wildcard – and the band performing it even more so. Frontmen Holly Johnson and Paul Rutherford were both openly gay, still a rarity in pop at the time, and courted controversy with the use of fetish wear in their performances and videos. Famously, it was censorship from the BBC that propelled the song to its peak: when it was at No 6 in the charts, BBC Radio 1’s breakfast DJ Mike Read yanked it off air after taking a cursory glance at the lewd lyrics and cover art. He declared he’d never play it again. The BBC backed him by banning it across all its shows – including TOTP. For five weeks, Frankie were announced as No 1 – and then the show played out on a different track.The song’s runaway success was testament to the fact that censorship and repression don’t work. It was a powerful message at the dawn of the Thatcher era: this was towards the beginning of the HIVAids epidemic that would devastate the LGBT community and lead to a dangerous increase in homophobia, and just three years before Thatcher would introduce the regressive Section 28 amendment. It was an era of hate, in which homosexuality was pushed even further to the fringes of society than it had been before. And yet, Frankie Goes to Hollywood prevailed.In an interview with the  in 2014, journalist Paul Morley – one of ZTT’s masterminds – reflected that the group’s success was like a “weird hallucination … The fact that something so successful yet is part of a shadowy history is ultimate proof that it was special.” It’s true that their dominance of British pop culture was momentary: they had two further No 1 singles and a bestselling album in 1984 1986’s Liverpool flopped, and Johnson went solo to some success. But at a pivotal, deeply conservative time in Britain’s history, their crowning glory was what they brought out of the shadows and thrust into the light."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e4627447f3152b3a1f64d2eea5563eb863cff9/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292598d450c3dedc4a233bd98e20b8e0","title":"how coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels","story":"Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales.

What contact tracing app that was supposed to be the key to ending lockdown? Oh that one! We never meant to imply it was that important. Or that it would necessarily be ready when we said it would. Rather it was just an adjunct to some other measures that we haven’t yet thought of. So we are in a game of musical chairs for the morally bankrupt. Which means that Michael Gove is in with a definite chance of winning.Gove is the ultimate shapeshifter. The politician who, more than any other, bends reality to suit his needs. Tonight, Matthew, he will be whoever he wants to be. All failures and shortcomings rewritten as outstanding successes. His two attempts to become party leader? Massive triumphs.Listening to the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster – there is no Brexit secretary any more – answer an urgent question on the third round of Brexit talks that had ended in deadlock you would have had no idea the UK was in the middle of the biggest public health crisis for a century. Or that the economy was contracting by the day and that there were now 10 million people on the furlough scheme, many of whom could be out of a job within months.Rather it was as if the clock had been rewound six months to the Brexit culture wars of late 2019. There wasn’t even a nod to the fact that it might be prudent to even consider the idea of extending transition by a short period, just to see what kind of state both the UK and the EU might be in come December. And whether we might cooperate with one another. Rather, we were fighting an ideological war in which everything Brussels did or said was bad and independence day couldn’t come soon enough.How dare the EU insist on making the demands it had always said it would make and had been largely agreed in the political declaration of the withdrawal agreement? And how dare Brussels demand we keep a level playing field on standards, hygiene and workers’ rights when ours were already far higher than the EU’s? Apart from the ones we were were going to lower to get a free trade agreement with the US.Labour’s Rachel Reeves did try to talk Mikey down. Though appealing to his reason is never the best tactic, as the Govester isn’t strong on rationality. She rightly observed that seven months wasn’t long to try to iron out all the remaining details – the cabinet can’t even agree among itself whether customs and border checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland – and that adding to the uncertainty in such uncertain times was potentially catastrophic.Gove had no answer other than to accuse Labour of having no clear plan and that he was sticking to his own regardless. Get Brexit Done. Which had been rather Reeves’s point all along. That not having a clear Brexit plan and hedging your bets over the length of transition was the only sensible option under the circumstances.In the end the Speaker had to interrupt Mikey mid-rant but Gove continued in much the same vein for the rest of the half-hour session. Why were people so obsessed with the coronavirus? It was just an EU plot to thwart Brexit. The people had voted for Brexit and that was what they were going to get. Regardless of how many people had to die or lose their jobs in the process.As if to reinforce the idea that the government was fed up with everyone going on about the coronavirus – what was the big deal about 50,000 deaths and the disappearance from public view of Boris Johnson? – the environment minister, George Eustice, was sent out to take the Downing Street press conference. Because no one is more likely to make people reach for the off button than the most forgettable of cabinet ministers. More so even than Thérèse Coffey, who at least has some unintended comedy value. Earlier in the day she had unwittingly told the BBC that there were plenty of unfilled jobs. I guess she had the Cabinet in mind.Eustice did the prime minister proud by giving a masterclass in banality. He had come with nothing to say and was determined to make sure he said it. So he raced through the same slides that have been shown at every other press conference, before lamenting there were no foreigners to pick soft fruit these days – who would have guessed? – and begging Brits on furlough to support the national effort. It still hasn’t dawned on the government that EU workers were quite handy for doing the low-paid work Brits couldn’t be bothered to do.Within minutes the minister had put almost his entire audience to sleep. That meant few heard him saying it had been a brilliant idea to stop testing and tracing in March because it made the current levels of testing look all the more impressive. And it had been absolutely right to fill care homes with residents who hadn’t been tested because zzzzzzzzz take back control zzzzzzz making our own laws zzzzzzzz and they would have died sooner or later anyway zzzzzzzz. Come the end, I couldn’t even be sure if Eustice was still awake. Another day had passed in which no one had taken responsibility for anything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b96e3dd1228c3f85f901542f90a7e639b763f2e4/0_401_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d4801741d4cae8829056bc4f759d4b1","title":"unions call national recovery council rebuild uk economy","story":"Exclusive: Frances O’Grady says working people ‘can’t pay the price againThe leader of the Trades Union Congress has declared “the state is back” as the UK’s biggest unions urged the government to form a national recovery council in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The TUC, which represents 48 unions in England and Wales, has called in a report for the establishment of the body, which it argues would bring together government, unions and employers to create a greener and fairer economy.In an interview with the , the TUC general secretary said there could be no return to business as usual after the pandemic.“We’ve got to get that safety net strung again, we’ve got to invest in our public services, which may have to build resilience for a long time to come,” Frances O’Grady said. “Unions are back … but the state is back too.”“This can’t be about working people paying the price again,” said O’Grady. “I think there is a real sense that this has got to be a people’s effort. It can’t just be left to employers or politicians, we’ve got to step up too.”The TUC, which represents 5.5 million members, is also calling for an overhaul of the UK’s business model – which it argues is based on low-paid, insecure jobs and the exclusion of workers from decision-making. It has called for an increase in the minimum wage to £10 an hour, a public sector pay rise, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme – particularly for young people facing a bleak future.In the far-reaching document the TUC argues that systems for trade and finance damage the interests of poorer countries and drive unfair pay, and calls for changes to international rules and institutions, as well as a plan to tackle discrimination faced by black and minority ethnic people, women and disabled people.It praises the government’s “constructive” work with unions on the creation of the job retention scheme, adding that the ability of local authorities to take homeless people off the street, the emergence of mutual support groups and the adaptability of the workforce, as well as government interventions, “show the speed and scale of what can be done when it is necessary”. It adds that the same commitment and urgency must be applied to tackling the climate emergency.“We’ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy,” said O’Grady.Industry bailouts and any state investment in the next few months must come with an “Olympics-style plan” for jobs and a minimum requirement for the use of UK products and services to rebuild UK manufacturing, says the report. With unemployment levels set to increase dramatically, it argues jobless people should be given a “funded inidual learning account” to learn new skills, with the promise of a job at the end of training.“We’ve got to build back brick by brick, but it has to be fair, decent rewards, fair taxes – all of that has got to be back on the agenda,” said O’Grady. “I think the centre of gravity has shifted and people are remembering why equality matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc460bfd66f9f7e8431649cf7c758441abe1dcf/0_27_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=689cdee1fa49d0019bef97a7146eaaf5","title":"petition key workers exempt london congestion charge","story":"No one should be financially penalised for working to keep people safe, say criticsThe government and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, are being urged to exempt key workers from the reimposed and increased congestion charge amid warnings it will penalise those serving the public during the pandemic.An £11.50 daily charge was reintroduced this week as a condition of a £1.6bn government bailout for Transport for London (TfL).The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..As part of the deal the cost will rise to £15 from 22 June. The charge, which had been suspended during lockdown, will also be extended from weekdays to the whole week and for longer hours.Critics say the plan runs counter to pleas by ministers for commuters to use cars if they can to relieve pressure on the transport network. NHS and care home workers will be be entitled to a refund if their employers are based in central London.A TfL spokesman said: “The rationale for the exemption is a recognition of the essential role they are playing in responding to coronavirus, and the fact that they could come into close contact with a large number of people who have coronavirus, and could infect people they come into contact with.”But he confirmed all other workers including teachers, police officers, firefighters, and transport workers would have to pay the increase charges in full.The politan Police Federation chairman, Ken Marsh, said officers should not be “penalised” for trying to keep London safe. “Since the beginning of this pandemic, police officers in London have worked tirelessly to keep the public safe at no little risk to themselves,” he said.“To be told that they now have to pay the congestion charge when other key workers retain an exemption is a slap in the face to our brave colleagues. At a time when we are being discouraged from using public transport to get to our places of work, this seems to go completely against government guidelines.”More than 3,000 people have signed a petition calling for a full exemption for all key workers.The petition, by Lee Steery, an emergency worker from Thurrock in Essex who works outside the NHS, said the changes would “cost thousands of hard-working people who need to drive into London for work, hundreds, possibly thousands of pounds, a year extra”.He added: “This will affect key workers, who will be the ones impacted the most due to being shift workers, unable to use public transport at all hours, with no other means of transport, who are the people keeping the currently moving during this pandemic.“I, like thousands who work for the emergency services, will find it impossible to get to and from work from currently paying barely anything a month in congestion charge to potentially having to pay £75 per five-day working week.”The former Labour minister Dame Joan Ruddock tweeted that the new charge was a “kick in the teeth” for low-paid key workers. She also claimed the conditions imposed on the bailout were designed to discredit Khan.One commuter, Kath Stirling, told London’s deputy mayor for transport, Heidi Alexander, it would cost key workers an extra £57.50 a week for following official advice to travel by car.Another asked Boris Johnson: “How are we meant to maintain social distancing when you … @SadiqKhan are reinstating the congestion charge forcing us all back onto public transport.”The GMB union, whose members includes couriers, and bus and minicab drivers, said it had “legions” of emails and calls from members worried about costs that could put some of them out of business.Steve Garelick, its London regional organiser, said: “Those who are carrying out private hire work are now seeing a further increase in the cost of work during an incredibly austere period. They have got to find a way of covering this extra cost at time when there is little or no work. Private-hire drivers feel like they have been sold down the river. Thousands of people feel hurt and angry about this.“If you are a courier having to deliver into central London, you’re suddenly having to pay a congestion charge, which is taking money off your bottom line. The government needs to put a halt to this until we have come out of the crisis, and then reconsider how and who pays for such a charge.”Joseph Onyegbule, a private-hire driver, said: “The increase of the £15 congestion charge is more than any of us can bear. I am already having to work a minimum of 14 hours a day.”He fears the fee increase, which will cost him an extra £6,000 per year, will force him out of business.He pointed out that for a typical fare to central London he would make £8 or £9, but it would now cost him £11.50 and from next month £15. “I’ll be working below the minimum wage and I’ve got a mortgage to pay,” he said.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f12eb78b762a35840885aaa1fbfd2d9b4abce3c/0_85_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d04d913c2ad7a05adcf9023644484ed","title":"nasa head of human spaceflight doug loverro suddenly resigns days before historic space mission","story":"Doug Loverro quits ahead of next week’s mission to send two astronauts to the International Space Station on a SpaceX flightA leading figure at Nasa responsible for the agency’s human spaceflight programs has suddenly resigned just days before the US is set to send astronauts back into space from American soil for the first time since the Space Shuttle program was retired almost a decade ago.Doug Loverro, the official in charge of the human spaceflight ision, left on Monday, Nasa said.Next week, Elon Musk’s SpaceX is due to put two US astronauts on a much-anticipated test flight of the company’s Dragon capsule to the International Space Station from Florida.Nasa indicated on Tuesday the launch would proceed according to that schedule.

A spokesperson did not immediately respond to media queries about the background to Loverro’s abrupt departure.But the announcement took the space community by surprise, Space News reported.Loverro was a Pentagon official in the past. He had been in the human spaceflight role at Nasa for a matter of a few months. The Washington Post reported that his resignation came after he broke a rule during Nasa’s recent procurement of a spacecraft capable of landing humans on the moon, quoting two people with knowledge of the situation.Earlier this year Nasa selected three private space companies to lead the development of lunar landers for its forthcoming moon landings.The three companies are Blue Origin, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Dynetics, based in Huntsville, Alabama.

However, those wanting to play contact sports – including rugby with full scrummaging, boxing and mixed martial arts – are likely to have to wait until September or October before a full return to action is deemed safe.One government source stressed while the new proposals were dependent on the wider picture across society, there had been a shift in thinking and that guidelines from representatives of the UK’s 7,000 gyms to potentially reopen were now being actively considered.Another source said gyms had worked “really hard to bring sensible solutions” to the table and that, as a result, they could open much earlier than October, as had originally been envisaged.A meeting between the government, health officials and representatives of the gym and leisure industry will take place in the coming days to sketch out a potential roadmap back.Huw Edwards, the chief executive of UK Active, which represents thousands of gyms and leisure centres, said he was cautiously optimistic the industry – which employs 400,000 people and is worth around £8bn a year – could be back on its feet by the summer. “We want to open in a way which is safe for staff and customers, allows people to come back and train, and then gets businesses up and running again,” he said.“The government has said to us nothing before the fourth of July. Our plan is to take government and Public Health England officials out to sites to reassure them that gyms can safely implement social distancing. We are going to be a completely open book.”Edwards said UK Active have spent five weeks drawing up plans for how gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools could reopen while observing government guidelines. The advice includes spacing exercise equipment two metres apart or marking every other machine as out of order and a maximum capacity for users at any one time depending on the size of the gym.“The guidance goes through everything: from deep-cleaning equipment and reworking gym floors and studios to maintain social distancing rules and the need to have signs to direct people so the flow feels more when you enter a supermarket,” he said. “Naturally, there will be reduced capacity too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2fb43104f440911ee25bb378546b1754610fe63/0_122_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=902727116b47a20503bbed8f8e9a6098","title":"merger of equals johanna konta backs idea to combine atp and wta tours","story":"Johanna Konta has cautiously offered her support to the idea of the ATP and the WTA tours merging.While discussions about the viability of a merger were pushed into the spotlight by tweets from Roger Federer in April – since when both ATP and WTA chief executives, Andrea Gaudenzi and Steve Simon – have expressed support for it, Konta has underlined that it remains only an idea.A prominent member of the WTA player council – which has convened frequently since the tour suspension – Konta points out that “not so much” has been said since the initial discussion following Federer’s tweets. Should anything come to fruition, she stresses the need for equality.“For me, for my comprehension, I don’t understand how it wouldn’t be of equals because if we are then talking about that, would it be us literally saying we are worth less than our male counterparts? It would have to be a merger of equals because that’s what we are. I wouldn’t see how, right now in today’s age, it would be allowed to be called anything else.”It is not difficult to understand Konta’s caution. This time last year, her run to the semi‑finals at Roland Garros ended against Marketa Vondrousova after they were forced on to a half‑empty stadium away from the show courts following bad weather. She said afterwards that she was tired of women having to “justify their scheduling or their involvement in an event or their salary or their opportunities”. She understands the potential cost of the WTA losing its independence.As eloquent as Konta has always been on general issues, she can be less forthcoming about her own tennis. She often projects her mentality, cocooning herself in relentless positivity. It can be difficult to know how she really feels. One year later, it is refreshing to hear an honest reflection of her Parisian fortnight.“To make it to the semis for the first time since 2017 was something special. But then there was bit of heartbreak for me … it was a tough match to lose because I had opportunities, and my opponent played well. Definitely whoever was going to lose that match was going to hurt, and it definitely hurt. But I can look back and say I am a semi-finalist at the French Open and it’s something I can be proud of. And who knows, I may get another opportunity.”As for now, Konta’s ongoing knee injury is “getting there” but is something she will always have to manage. She is open to contesting the planned LTA national tournaments as the tour remains frozen, now suspended until at least 31 July with the US Open’s status to be declared in mid-June. She has started the Johanna Konta Podcast to pass the time. She misses strolling to her favourite cafe in Battersea Park.“I miss people being relaxed as well,” the 29-year-old player said. “When you’re outside you can feel people being anxious. I think there are quite a lot of angry people about, although there are a lot of very kind people who are being more friendly than normal and want to interact. But there is a lot of anxiety about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c440a8654f3ac628ca55523430d8106a6887adcd/420_334_4873_2925/master/4873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbca512eb29fcdd06b09c6e318f43d64","title":"surface go 2 review microsofts smaller cheaper windows 10 tablet","story":"New model squeezes bigger screen in same body, for an excellent, affordable ultraportable PC The Surface Go 2 is Microsoft’s second iteration of its low-cost, smaller tablet computer and continues to prove that cheap Windows PCs don’t have to be terrible.The Surface Go 2 starts at £399, but for that you don’t get the £100 Type Cover keyboard, which is a must-have. That places the Surface Go 2 in the low-end PC bracket and makes it Microsoft’s cheapest current PC, undercutting the Surface Pro 7 by £300.Tested here is the £529 Intel Pentium Gold 4425Y version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of faster SSD storage with the £125 Alcantara Type Cover.Not a lot has changed since the original. The Surface Go 2 has a slightly larger 10.5in screen, which helps boost the real estate you have on there. Other than an extra 22g in weight, the magnesium body of the machine is identical to the original Surface Go, at 8.3mm thick, 245mm long and 175mm tall. It weighs in at 544g. By any metric the Surface Go 2 is a tiny portable PC, that’s easy to carry or fit in a bag, much like Apple’s similarly priced and sized iPad Air.The 10.5in LCD touchscreen is great. Crisp, bright, good looking and responsive. The kickstand on the back continues to be fantastic, while the build quality is top notch.The new Pentium Gold 4425Y performs more or less the same as the Pentium Gold 4415Y in the original Surface Go, according to both benchmarks and real-world experience. That means it’s not exactly fast, but is capable of more than you might imagine.Photo editing in Affinity Photo was a just little slow for complex tasks, word processing and general office duties were no bother, while the new Chromium-based Edge browser handled 10+ tabs with ease. Only a little slowdown was noticeable when you tried to do too much at once, such as updating apps, browsing and using a word processor all at the same time.The tablet even managed to power a 4K display at 60Hz via USB-C without issue.When just used for video playback the Surface Go 2 lasted closer to eight hours, streaming video via Netflix.Like the recent Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3, the Surface Go 2 continues Microsoft’s trend of more repairable devices, and was awarded a score of three out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit, which is two-points better than the previous generation Surface Go.Some of the components are modular but not user-replaceable, except for the detachable keyboard, and repairs must be performed by authorised service providers. The out-of-warranty service fee for the Surface Go 2 from Microsoft is £236.40.The Surface Go 2 ships with Windows 10 Home in S mode, which restricts the installation of apps to those from the Microsoft Store for greater security. Turning off S mode is a one-time operation that cannot be reversed, but it takes just a couple of clicks.S mode is great if you live within Microsoft’s ecosystem, or if everything you need is in the Microsoft Store, but it blocks the installation of programs such as Chrome, WhatsApp desktop and Signal, which aren’t available.As a productivity machine the Surface Go 2 is solid. It managed everything I do as a journalist without much fuss, including simple word processing, spreadsheet-wrangling, browsing, note taking, image editing and video conferencing. It would struggle with serious video editing.The slightly larger 10.5in screen helps with split-screen multi-tasking, such as Evernote on the right and PDFs on the left of the screen, but still requires lots of sideways scrolling in documents and websites.As a home-entertainment machine, things are little trickier. The great screen and good speakers make the Surface Go 2 good for video, but there’s still an large app gap compared to Apple’s iPad.The Microsoft Store sells movies and TV shows, and has a great Netflix app, including offline downloads, Virgin TV Go, Demand 5 and iTunes. But others such as Disney+, Amazon Video, Google Play Movies, ITV Hub, BBC iPlayer, All4 and Sky Go have to be viewed in a browser.BBC iPlayer and Sky Go have fairly clunky programs that allow offline downloads, but they are not in the Microsoft Store, so not accessible in S mode.Reading apps are equally few and far between, with no Kindle, Comixology or Marvel Unlimited apps at all.One big advantage Windows 10 has over Apple’s iPad OS is support for multiple users. This includes limited and monitored kids’ accounts, which work great with Windows Hello face recognition.The Surface Go 2’s Type Cover keyboard is the same as the previous version and is cross-compatible, costing £100 or £125, depending on the material.The Type Cover is one of the best keyboards available on any laptop or tablet, matching those available for the larger Surface Pro 7, but with a slightly smaller layout, which took about five minutes to get used to.The keys feel great and the trackpad is smooth, responsive and accurate. It will beat any keyboard and trackpad fitted to any Windows laptop or Chromebook under £500, and should have been included in the price of the tablet.The Surface Go 2 once again proves that budget Windows PCs can be good.It won’t win any awards for speed, but it will handle most things without locking up or driving you nuts. The magnesium body and 10.5in screen are far better than what you’ll get elsewhere for under £400, while the kickstand and range of accessories are great.As with the original, the app gap means the Surface Go 2 is a better productivity machine than media-consumption tablet. But it’s also good for sharing with the family, and is up to being your only computer or used as an ultraportable second computer.The 64GB version will be slower as it uses eMMC storage instead of the faster SSD technology. And while £399 is an extremely attractive starting price, it doesn’t include the essential £100 Type Cover keyboard.Other than wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5 support, only the slightly larger 10.5in screen really separates the lower-end Pentium Gold Surface Go 2 models from the equally excellent original, so look out for cut-price deals.At the real price of £499 or more, you can certainly get a more powerful Windows laptop, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better experience. The gutsy little Surface Go 2 is simply great.Cons: relatively short battery life, no USB-A ports, £100 keyboard essential but not included, relatively slow performance This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.”Le Bonniec, 25, worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Cork offices, transcribing user requests in English and French, until he quit in the summer of 2019 due to ethical concerns with the work. “They do operate on a moral and legal grey area,” he told the  at the time, “and they have been doing this for years on a massive scale. They should be called out in every possible way.”Following the revelations of Le Bonniec and his colleagues, Apple promised sweeping changes to its “grading” program, which involved thousands of contractors listening to recordings made, both accidentally and deliberately, using Siri. The company apologised, brought the work in-house, and promised that it would only grade recordings from users who had explicitly opted-in to the practice.“We realise we have not been fully living up to our high ideals,” the company said in a statement in August. It eventually released a software update in late October that allowed users to opt-in or out of their voice recordings being used to “improve Siri dictation”, and to choose to delete the recordings that Apple had stored. The company also emphasised that, unlike its competition, Siri recordings are never linked to a specific Apple account.But, Le Bonniec argues, the company never really faced the consequences for its years-long programme in the first place.“I listened to hundreds of recordings every day, from various Apple devices (eg. iPhones, Apple Watches, or iPads). These recordings were often taken outside of any activation of Siri, eg in the context of an actual intention from the user to activate it for a request. These processings were made without users being aware of it, and were gathered into datasets to correct the transcription of the recording made by the device,” he said.“The recordings were not limited to the users of Apple devices, but also involved relatives, children, friends, colleagues, and whoever could be recorded by the device. The system recorded everything: names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, background noises, films, and conversations. I heard people talking about their cancer, referring to dead relatives, religion, sexuality, pornography, politics, school, relationships, or drugs with no intention to activate Siri whatsoever.“These practices are clearly at odds with the company’s ‘privacy-driven’ policies and should be urgently investigated by data protection authorities and Privacy watchdogs. With the current statement, I want to bring this issue to your attention, and also offer my cooperation to provide any element substantiating these facts. Although this case has already gone public, Apple has not been subject to any kind of investigation to the best of my knowledge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

Tourism feeds me and my daughter. It lets me give jobs to 22 people. It goes into the whole community,” says Naima Montejo, owner of Surf Meds Caribe, the only female-run surf school on Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast.“We’ve been planting, growing food, trying to come back to our roots,” she says. “There’s not much money, so we’ve been trading. Some trees or seeds, some yucca or plantain. We switch. People are getting together, being creative. What we can do is help each other.”Montejo lives in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, a coastal town known for surf, three-toed sloths and an eight-mile stretch of jungle-edged sandy beach (now behind police tape). With a tropical climate and jubilant mix of Tico, African-Caribbean, indigenous and nearly 70 more nationalities, it touts pared-back beach life and an offbeat Caribbean vibe: languid yet lively. Much of the region is nature reserve. Most of its residents remember a time when the only route to town was the beach and, like a lot of the country, tourism is its lifeforce.Puerto Viejo has been “shut” since 16 March, when Costa Rica declared a state of emergency, and then closed borders, businesses and beaches in quick succession. The country’s mantra, main greeting and answer to all questions, pura vida (literally, pure life), was traded for quédate en casa (stay at home).With the exception of a local ley seca (dry law) banning booze sales – quietly dropped in April – the general view is that the swift, strict response worked. With its hotels and rental homes shuttered and driving access restricted, remote Puerto Viejo has no registered cases (or hospitals).But running a surf school when the beach is behind police tape, you have no students and strict social distancing is in place “has been hard on all of us,” says Montejo, whose team are all ardent pro-level surfers “usually more in the water than out”.With lessons off, Montejo has got back into landscaping and garden design, and her work as a jeweller. Making ends meet “takes a lot more energy,” she says, “but the only thing that really worries me is the guys: a lot of them live from teaching.”The government is paying out a monthly unemployment “bonus”, but only to those “officially” employed before the crisis. Which leaves out the casual workers, from fishermen to bike rental people, who usually cater to the 400,000 international visitors Costa Rica’s Caribbean area sees every year. Many of this number, plus thousands more Costa Ricans, come especially for Semana Santa, Easter week. Last year, hostel Selina, in Puerto Viejo, sold 1,045 beds between 14 and 20 April.“I’d never seen anything like it,” says Matías Llaituqueo, who runs Spanish language classes , as well as managing a local hotel and several Airbnb properties. He moved to Puerto Viejo from Argentina 13 years ago. “Semana Santa is incredible here: the people, the traffic, it’s so busy. But this year, nothing. No people on the street: like a ghost town.”The tourist exodus left established expats and a smattering of travellers, including several escapees from Panama’s locked-down Tribal Gathering festival. Some are pleased to wait out the pandemic jungle-side others are concerned about the start of dengue season and the flesh-eating papalomoyo parasite (fun to say, terrible to have).Of the unafflicted expats, many are following the worldwide upskilling trend. Llaituqueo’s Spanish classes have, if anything, increased: “People want to use their time well,” he says. “They can’t move, they can’t travel, they can’t go to the beach – so they decide to learn.”Rohrmoser and her mother – both originally from the capital, San José – opened the hotel a year and a half ago. They’re now facing relative inaction until the end of the year. “It had just started happening,” Rohrmoser says. “It’s heartbreaking, to give opportunities to so many people and now try to maintain things, keep jobs and keep a sense of perspective.”This week, Costa Rica’s boutique hotels, restaurants and national parks have reopened at limited capacity, while the beach is accessible from 5am-8am. But the impact has already been felt. Shevonne Newton set up Puerto Viejo Esenciales to supplement official food banks with necessities such as cooking gas and pet food, but found the need for food was far more urgent.“This has just made it more extreme,” she says. “Locals were already struggling. Now they definitely don’t have their gardening or their cooking positions. Without tourism the businesses just go under.”The impact may go beyond people and harm the environment, too. “You can’t ask people to prioritise conservation when they’re struggling to eat,” says Becky Cliffe, who runs the Sloth Conservation Foundation in Puerto Viejo and holds a PhD in sloth behaviour. Fewer visitors means fewer cars, and fewer tourists harassing the town’s sloth residents, she says. But on the other hand, the crisis can “mean the exploitation of nature: hunting, cutting down trees for wood – and lost income for the rescue centres”.Nature guide Abel Bustamante agrees: “Many conservation programmes are closed because there are no volunteers. We go to the beach first thing to stop people taking turtle eggs and selling or eating them. Sadly, they mean money or food, and you don’t think about sustainability when you need to eat.”The community is using the time to preserve its cherished pura vida, with landlocked surfers reforesting the beachside areas affected by erosion: “We used to come out of the water, grab some mango, eat right there and go back to surf – but these trees have disappeared,” says Montejo. “Tourism picked up really quickly here. Hopefully, after this we can manage it more respectfully.” There’s a lot to work out for Montejo’s team: from how to run a biosecure hotel to how to teach surfing in a world of social distancing. But for now, she’ll join the town’s surfers, swimmers, dog-walkers and fishermen for the sanctioned 5am-8am migration into Puerto Viejo’s indomitable ocean swell. Pura vida."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

He’s a true national treasure.”Moore raised a record-breaking sum by completing 100 laps of his garden – and provided welcome relief from relentlessly grim headlines at the peak of the virus’s outbreak.He turned 100 at the end of April, shortly after becoming the oldest artist to claim a UK No 1 single after collaborating with Michael Ball and the choir NHS Voices of Care on a cover of You’ll Never Walk Alone.Ball was among those to congratulate Moore on his knighthood, tweeting that he “couldn’t be more thrilled and proud” and calling it “a fitting honour for a true British hero”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: “On behalf of the Labour party, I congratulate Captain Tom Moore on his knighthood. In these difficult times for our country, Tom brought inspiration to millions and helped all of us to celebrate the extraordinary achievements of our NHS.“In his actions, Tom embodied the national solidarity which has grown throughout this crisis, and showed us that everyone can play their part in helping build a better future.”Starmer has accused the government of failing to do enough to protect veterans, many of whom are now in the care homes that have become coronavirus hotspots.A government spokesperson said they would also be saying more about how “frontline heroes” could be recognised in the days ahead.The spokesperson continued: “We know there is huge appetite to say thank you to all those supporting the nation during this emergency and doing incredible things day in, day out, up and down the country. “We will ensure these unsung heroes are recognised in the right way, at the right time.”Ministers have declined to say at the regular press briefings whether they believe nurses and other NHS and care staff who have put their lives at risk should receive a pay increase.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said last week “there has been a significant pay rise for nurses, and I think one of the things the crisis has shown is just how much the nation values our staff across the health and care system, including nurses.“When it comes to how we reward their efforts in this crisis, what I can tell you is, as the health secretary, I will be making sure that we fight to have that fair reward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0ff74f72845ef3b19603548036504bd51b37e4/0_256_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dd0ad566d56ac2f22fcebbeef4e3390","title":"up to 1500 english primary schools to defy 1 june reopening plan","story":"Coronavirus rebellion by councils forces government to say it will not sanction themUp to 1,500 primary schools in England are expected to remain closed on 1 June after a rebellion by at least 18 councils forced the government to say it had no plans to sanction them.As the backlash escalated over the government’s policy of lifting the coronavirus lockdown on schools in a fortnight, a number of new local authorities said on Tuesday they would not force primary schools in their area to follow the plan. Councils joining those already in opposition included Birmingham, Calderdale council in Yorkshire, and Conservative-controlled Solihull. In total they represent more than 1,500 maintained primaries.With more councils likely to join them on Wednesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, met union leaders to address concerns that the plan could put staff at risk and contribute to the spread of coronavirus. Downing Street said its aim was to work “in a consultative way” rather than impose penalties on schools or councils that rejected the reopening date.Reports earlier this week suggested councils that refused to comply could be subject to legal action or even financial penalties, but the prime minister’s spokesman told reporters: “We are continuing to work closely with teachers, schools and the unions, as we have done for the past eight weeks, and remain keen to hear any concerns they may have.“We are preparing for the possible opening of schools for more children from 1 June at the earliest, but that will only happen if it is safe to do so. But we do also have to bear in mind the harm which can be done to children by missing out on important education.”Asked if there could be any sanctions for those who disagreed, he said: “You can see what the focus of our attention is at the moment, which is trying to work with them in a consultative way in order to be able to open schools to more pupils in a way that is safe.”The government has said it wants children in nursery, reception, years 1 and 6 to begin a phased return to schools from 1 June, with other years following soon after, so primary children are in school for a month before the summer holidays, as long as the government’s five tests for easing lockdown have been met.However, another obstacle to the 1 June target emerged on Tuesday when the deputy chief scientific adviser Dame Angela McLean said all changes to lockdown would require an effective system for tracing and isolating new cases to be in place, effectively adding a sixth test. McLean said changes should be based on “observed levels of infection … and not of a fixed date”. Apart from the councils that have said they will not be opening primary schools according to the government timetable, others, including Bristol, Southampton and Newcastle, said they would leave it to inidual schools to decide based on risk assessments.The Labour leader of Calderdale council, Tim Swift, said the “clear professional advice” they have is that not all of the government’s five tests for opening schools are being met. He cited concerns over the local rate of infection and limited access to testing.The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:“There is not enough evidence that the levels of infection in the community are low and falling and we are not confident that there is guaranteed access to testing so that, in the event of a case, both the inidual concerned and all their contacts can be identified and rapidly tested for the virus,” he said.“Our priority as a council and as a Labour group throughout this crisis has been to put the safety and wellbeing of our community first. For these reasons, whilst we want our schools to plan for opening up to more children when it is safe to do so, we are strongly advising schools that they should not be doing this as soon as 1 June.”Labour-held Leeds city council said the government reopening date was impossible. “Due to a variety of factors, it would be impossible for all schools to operate to the government’s timetable of opening reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June,” said Cllr Jonathan Pryor, an executive member for learning and skills. “While some schools will begin to gradually expand their intake from this date, Leeds will not expect all our schools to open to all those pupils from day one.”Birmingham city council wrote to parents saying schools would only open to more pupils when it was safe. “We all know how valuable regular attendance at school is, particularly for the most vulnerable children, and we are committed to having due regard to the guidance that has been issued by the government. However, we recognise that for some schools, opening to more pupils safely may not be possible on 1 June, while parents and s must also feel reassured.”Ian Courts, the leader of Solihull council, said the priority was to ensure the safety of every child and staff member. “The reality in Solihull is that schools will need to use that first week in June to ensure they are completely ready for more pupils to attend. So places may only be available from the week beginning 8 June.”In Bradford, Cllr Imran Khan, portfolio holder for education, employment and skills, said: “Bradford council has no intention of directing schools to open on 1 June or to force parents to send their children back and we are committed to working in partnership with school leaders, families and trade unions so that they can make sure their schools are safe environments for our children whenever they choose to open.”Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, Barking and Dagenham, and Redbridge – both in London – have also expressed reservations about the 1 June date.On Tuesday, a recording emerged of the National Education Union chief, Dr Mary Bousted, telling members that while its “negotiating position” was that it would not engage with the 1 June plan, that could change if public support for its stance waned.Secondary school pupils preparing for exams are expected to get some “face time” with teachers where possible. Schools have been closed since 20 March, except for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9e2031501a7e6fa0c4f252fdc361fa2cca8158/0_226_3648_2188/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553162fbe9646662fa7e3e10fb4f2f28","title":"climate change turning parts antarctica green say scientists algae","story":"Researchers map ‘beginning of new ecosystem’ as algae bloom across surface of melting snowScientists have mapped “the beginning of a new ecosystem” on the Antarctic peninsula as microscopic algae bloom across the surface of the melting snow, tinting the surface green and potentially creating a source of nutrition for other species.The British team behind the research believe these blooms will expand their range in the future because global heating is creating more of the slushy conditions they need to thrive.In some areas, the single-cell life-forms are so dense they turn the snow bright green and can be seen from space, according to the study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications.Biologists from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey spent six years detecting and measuring the green snow algae using a combination of satellite data and ground observation.The result is the first large-scale algae map of the peninsular, which will be used as a baseline to assess the speed at which the white continent is turning green due to the climate crisis and potentially offering sustenance to other species.They have already found the algae have formed close bonds with tiny fungal spores and bacteria. “It’s a community. This could potentially form new habitats. It’s the beginning of a new ecosystem,” said Matt Davey of Cambridge University, one of the scientists who led the study.He described the algae map as a missing piece of the carbon cycle jigsaw in the Antarctic.It identifies 1,679 separate blooms of green snow algae, which together covered an area of 1.9 sq km, equating to a carbon sink of about 479 tonnes a year. This is equivalent to the emissions of about 875,000 car journeys in the UK, though in global terms it is too small to make much of a difference to the planet’s carbon budget.Almost two-thirds of the green algal blooms were found on small, low-lying islands around the north of the peninsula, which has experienced some of the most intense heating in the world, with new temperature records being set this summer. The snow algae were less conspicuous in colder, southern regions.Scientists have previously observed an increase in green lichen and moss, but these grow extremely slowly compared with algae. In future, they will also measure red and orange algae and calculate how the presence of such colourful forms might be affecting the heat-reflecting albedo quality of the snow.“I think we will get more large blooms in the future. Before we know whether this has a significant impact on carbon budgets or bio albedo, we need to run the numbers,” said Andrew Gray, the lead author of the paper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a62aa6bb20a0bb708e1ae146956a2a41dd8344/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1ed68ad2c73445e9e41c660b3976ea69","title":"jacinda ardern flags four day working week as way to rebuild new zealand after covid 19","story":"Prime minister says flexible working options can boost productivity and domestic tourism and improve worklife balanceNew Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent worklife balance issues.In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals.The prime minister’s informal comments have excited New Zealanders, many of whom are questioning whether seismic, systemic change will result from the pandemic – or whether life will return to normal with its associated problems.Speaking from Rotorua, one of the country’s tourist hubs, Ardern said many New Zealanders said they would travel more domestically if they had more flexibility in their working lives. The country’s tourism market has taken a massive downturn after the pandemic, with all borders remaining closed to foreign nationals and many New Zealanders taking pay-cuts or tightening their belt in case of lay-offs.“I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day workweek. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I’ve said there’s just so much we’ve learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,” Ardern said.“I’d really encourage people to think about that if you’re an employer and in a position to do so. To think about if that’s something that would work for your workplace because it certainly would help tourism all around the country.”Andrew Barnes is the founder of Perpetual , a business of more than 200 people that transitioned to a four-day workweek in 2018.Barnes found the shift made his employees happier and more productive and said the regime also had benefits for mental and physical health, the environment, family and social lives, and climate change.“New Zealand could definitely go to a four-day week in the aftermath of Covid, and in fact it would be a strategy to rebuild the economy and particularly the hard-hit tourism market as it pivots to a domestic focus,” Barnes said.“We need to retain all the productivity benefits working from home has brought, including cleaner air and a lack of gridlock lost productivity from commuting while helping businesses stay afloat. We have to be bold with our model. This is an opportunity for a massive reset.”Barnes said New Zealand could model its new way of work on the German system of kurzarbeit, meaning “short work”, allowing more people to stay in jobs and using the extra day to upskill or retrain.“Finally, we have to factor in the need to address widespread mental health problems,” Barnes said.Tens of thousands of New Zealanders have been made redundant during the lockdown period, with building company Fletchers announcing 1000 lay-offs today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ac8b2ddfffd517c7cf548a081d971e8850a6d4/0_125_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36e33878bfac8efb38282fa055f357f5","title":"no one had any idea contact tracers lack knowledge about covid 19 job","story":"Employees told to consult YouTube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved personThey were hailed as stepping up to serve their country, with all the “rigorous” and “detailed” instruction needed for such an important role – but a programme to train thousands of contact-tracers to help control the spread of coronavirus has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits.People hired to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 and advise them to self-isolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system, and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles.New contact tracers have been told to rely on a two-page script and a list of frequently asked questions, both seen by the . When one taking part in a training session, run by contact centre company Sitel, asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus, they were reportedly told to look at YouTube videos on the topic.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on Monday that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England, surpassing the initial target of 18,000. “They have rigorous training with detailed procedure designed by our experts at Public Health England,” he said. “They have stepped up to serve their country in their hour of need.”Hancock claimed the government now had “the elements we need to roll out our national test and trace service: the testing capacity, the tracing capability and the technology”.But one man, who asked to remain anonymous, told the  he had spent three days getting paid, but receiving very little information or training.He said he had applied for a job as a “Work at Home – Customer Service Adviser” for £10 an hour, which was advertised on the job website Indeed. He got an email checking he had the right software, and then received a call to tell him what the job entailed and ask when he could start.The people in the training were told they would be acting as agents in the contact-tracing team, working on behalf of PHE. “You will be acting as the first point of contact with the contacts of confirmed positive cases of Covid-19,” they were told in a slide presentation seen by the .They were told they would be calling up confirmed contacts of positive coronavirus cases, recording their data and escalating “more challenging cases” – including people who refused to cooperate – to more senior call handlers.“After the full day of training, people were still asking the most basic things. Someone also asked what they should do if they spoke to someone whose relative had died of the virus and he said we should look on YouTube where there are lots of videos about empathy and sympathy when talking to someone,” said the man.“Then I looked at the rota and it said I was starting the next morning at 9am,” he said. He logged in first thing and received a message saying “sit tight and wait for us to instruct you”. He did nothing all day, but got an email assuring him he would still get paid and was told that he would be doing more training soon.One woman told the  she had been recruited to be a contact tracer and had spent three days trying and failing to log into the Sitel system. “Matt Hancock was saying last night that it was all ready to go,” she said. “It’s not.”Responding to the complaints about contact-tracing training, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care – also speaking on behalf of Sitel – said that recruits were being trained ahead of the rollout, so were not yet expected to make calls.They said that all applicants were interviewed through a combination of online assessments and telephone screening and had to provide Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and Right to Work information. They added that a suggestion to use YouTube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved person would be investigated and was not in line with their training.“Staff are trained on data security, customer service, safeguarding vulnerable children and adults, operating procedures, and when to escalate issues among other matters,” they said. “Only applicants that have passed the training modules and technical tests are allowed to move onto the next stage and start work.”The testimony from contact tracers is the latest sign of problems with the government’s attempt to establish an efficient track, trace and isolate system, to allow the country to return to something close to normal life.On Sunday, ministers were accused by Labour of “misstep after misstep” after contact tracing applicants were told recruitment was on hold while the government considered an alternative app.Emails sent by one of the private-sector companies handling the recruitment process, Kent-based HR Go, said: “Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the ‘Track and Trace’ app itself while the government considers an alternative app.”DHSC said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion”, though a government spokesperson confirmed the next day that the rollout of the app would not take place by the middle of May, as initially promised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58bb71cef77bae4ab11b12512f8cc61fb7fb18cc/438_0_5106_3066/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7646a30b1190ec730818b817930d74d","title":"palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ends security agreement with israel and us","story":"Declaration follows the creation of a new Israeli government which is officially contemplating annexation of some areas of the West BankThe Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has declared an end to security cooperation with the Israel and the United States, citing the imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank.The PLO voted to end cooperation with Israel and the US in 2018 and left it up to Abbas when to implement such a move. The Palestinian Authority (PA) president has threatened to stop such cooperation several times before, and it was unclear on Tuesday what his declaration would mean in practice, especially in terms of the future of the Palestinian security apparatus.“To pass the bar of credibility as a threat, to show this is not the same as the umpteen threats that they’ve previously issued of a similar nature and that they never acted on, the bar is very high,” said Daniel Levy, the president of the USMiddle East Project “We will actually have to see Palestinian action.”Some reports from Israel suggested that Palestinian security officials had been ordered to stop talking to their Israeli counterparts. But Palestinian officials have to coordinate with Israeli officers even to move between areas within the West Bank.Abbas’s declaration follows the creation of a new Israeli government which is officially contemplating annexation of some areas of the West Bank, apparently with the support of the Trump administration.“I do think this moment is qualitatively different than any other moment in the past, and that’s because Israel does look like it is prepared to annex some part of the West Bank,” Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said.“Not only is there nobody to stop Israel from moving forward, but also the US is a partner to this plan.”According to Israeli Channel 13 television, the Israeli ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, had been urging annexation before the US elections in November.“There is a window of opportunity now, so it must be done now.”Jordan’s King Abdullah warned on Saturday that Israeli annexation could lead to “a massive conflict” between his country and Israel and did not exclude a suspension of the 1994 peace treaty between them.Abbas’s declaration could lead to the end of intelligence sharing between Palestinian, Israeli and US security services. But it gave no hint of what Palestinian forces would do, when Israeli soldiers carry out incursions into Palestinian areas, or what it would mean for Palestinian movement around the West Bank between parts entirely administered by the PA (Area A), jointly run areas (B) and Israeli settlement zones (Area C).“What does it mean on the ground for PA security who – even to travel from area B to area B, through Area C – have to get permission from the Israeli army. Does that mean that if everything is frozen, that PA security can’t access certain parts of Area B,” asked Khaled Elgindy, a fellow in the centre for Middle East policy at the Brookings Institutions.“These are the kinds of questions that I think Palestinians will be asking, and then the Israelis, but I’m not sure there are clear answers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ec59811ae55b6c01322767705542c946e1b5ab/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01cc86860a362a7b62b5bbac048c4260","title":"super cyclone amphan evacuations in india and bangladesh slowed by virus","story":"Thousands of migrant workers left jobless by Covid-19 pandemic are still on the roads, and evacuations have been hampered by distancing rulesThe Bay of Bengal’s fiercest storm this century – super cyclone Amphan – was bearing down on millions of people in eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, with forecasts of a potentially devastating and deadly storm surge.Authorities have scrambled to stage mass evacuations away from the path of Super Cyclone Amphan, which is only the second “super cyclone” to form in the north-eastern Indian Ocean since records began.But their efforts have been hampered by the need to follow strict precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, with infection numbers still soaring in both countries.Many thousands of migrant workers are on the roads trying to get home from big cities after a nationwide lockdown destroyed their livelihoods.Out at sea the vast weather system visible from space has winds of up to 240 kmh (150mph), the equivalent of a category-four hurricane. It is expected to ease slightly before crossing the coasts of West Bengal and neighbouring Bangladesh but could still be strong enough to “cause large-scale and extensive damage”, said the head of India’s weather office Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.The Indian weather department forecast a storm surge of 10ft to 16-foot (3-5m)waves – as high as a two-storey house – that could swamp mud dwellings along the coast, uproot communication towers and inundate roads and rail tracks.Storm surges can force a wall of water to cascade several kilometres inland, and are often responsible for massive loss of life during the most severe cyclones.Bangladesh’s low-lying coast, home to 30 million people, and India’s east are regularly battered by cyclones that have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in recent decades.In 1999, the eastern state of Odisha was hit by a super cyclone that killed nearly 10,000 people. Eight years earlier, a typhoon, tornadoes and flooding killed 139,000 in Bangladesh.Bangladesh authorities fear Amphan will be the most powerful storm since Cyclone Sidr devastated the country in 2007, killing about 3,500 people and causing billions of dollars in damage.The country has been working to bring 2.2 million people to safety, while West Bengal was relocating 300,000 others.The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) aid group said people faced “an impossible choice” of braving the cyclone by staying put, or risking coronavirus infection in a shelter.Authorities in both countries said they were using extra shelter space to reduce crowding, while also making facemasks compulsory and providing extra soap and sanitiser.“We are also keeping separate isolation rooms in the shelters for any infected patients,” Bangladesh’s junior disaster management minister Enamur Rahman told AFP.Although outside the predicted direct path of the storm, there are fears for the safety of almost a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in south-eastern Bangladesh – most living in vast camps and housed in flimsy and makeshift shacks.The first coronavirus cases were reported there last week, and by Tuesday there were six confirmed infections.The UN said emergency items such as food, tarpaulins and water purification tablets had been stockpiled, while authorities said the refugees would be moved to sturdier buildings such as schools.“It will also undoubtedly increase the number of lives and livelihoods already lost to this pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4257536.1589908281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers must declare conflicts of interest when grading leaving cert students","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers’ unions and principals were consulting with the Department  on Tuesday over the final details of the official guidance which is due to be issued to thousands of teachers in the country’s 700-plus secondary schools this week. Photograph: Mark StedmanRollingNews.ieTeachers will be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members under official guidance to be issued shortly.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.School principals are also likely to be required to confirm that assessment grades and the rank order of students in a class are a true representation of student performance, according to sources.Teachers’ unions and principals were consulting with the Department of Education on Tuesday over the final details of the official guidance which is due to be issued to thousands of teachers in the country’s 700-plus secondary schools this week.Calculated gradesFollowing the Government decision earlier this month to cancel the summer Leaving Cert exams, more than 60,000 students are set to receive calculated grades for the first time based on teachers’ estimates.Under this approach, teachers will be asked to provide an estimated percentage mark for each student for each subject. Students will also be placed in a rank over for their class.The guidance is understood to state that teachers should draw on “existing records and available evidence” such as classwork, homework, class assessments, Christmas and summer exams and mock exams. Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions.In order to determine where students rank inidually in a class, each student may be marked out of 1,000 and these scores will then be converted to per centages.These grades will then be sent to the Department of Education where a unit will compare information on how students in the school have fared in particular subjects in the Leaving Cert over the past three years compared to the national standard.It will also review the performance of this year’s group of students against their overall performance at Junior Cycle level.This, the department says, will allow it to check whether the estimated percentage marks in each subject in the school are reasonable. These marks may be aligned upwards or downwards, accordingly.Inappropriate contactThe guidance is also expected to state that any attempt to offer teachers gifts or inducements in relation to students’ results will also be treated as a “serious attempt”to interfere with an entire school’s grades.Unions have also been pushing for a protocol to be included in the guidance which states that any inappropriate contact with teachers or schools will be formally recorded and forwarded to the department.Latest guidance from the department states that parents or students must not under any circumstances contact, directly or indirectly, a teacher or other staff member to discuss estimated marks or class rankings.“Such contact would be regarded as totally inappropriate and a serious attempt to interfere with the fairness and objectivity required of teachers and schools in the assigning of estimated marks and ranking for the inidual student concerned and for the students in the school as a whole,” according to new department guidance.It also says any attempt by teachers to allow discussion of estimated grades before the process is complete would interfere with the process being carried out properly and fairly.If teachers discuss the marks with some students but not others, or if some teachers did this and others did not, these discussions might actually influence or be construed as influencing the mark the teacher submits to the subject alignment group.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe World Health Organization (WHO) special envoy on Covid-19 has said it is now time to think about reopening schools in Ireland.Dr David Nabarro said he remains hopeful a vaccine can be found but that in the meantime getting used to living with the virus is going to be the new normal.Keeping children home from school for too long can have long-term effects on their development, warned Dr Nabarro, speaking to Newstalk Breakfast.“You have to balance the risk. Children staying at home, missing school – that is going to have a long-term impact on their future ability to earn and to be strong in society. “At the same time, we do believe that children, although they can get the virus, are not anything like as important at spreading the virus as some other members of the population – so we have got to give it a try,” he said. However, Dr Nabarro said before schools reopen teachers must be confident they can manage the return to school and that children understand social distancing.Schools had reopened in other countries while managing to keep students and staff safe, he said.“So, I am thinking the time has come, especially as you have got the numbers of cases being suppressed and you have got the defences building up, the time has come to gradually start reopening schools.”Given Ireland’s progress on suppressing the virus to date, Dr Nabarro said it was likely there were going to be people in Government who will start thinking “very, very seriously” that schools could be reopened soon. But he added that he had to be careful not to “overstep” his remit as a WHO representative.Any move to bring some classes back would have to be done very carefully “because so much depends on whether the teachers are comfortable and whether the parents are happy to send their kids back to school”.Earlier this month, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the Department of Education is focused on a September return for schools and that he does “not anticipate” they will open before that date.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on May 13th that “among the safest things” the State can do in the coming months is to reopen schools for children, raising fresh questions over the time-line for reopening schools and childcare facilities.In a submission to the Department of Education over plans to reopen schools in September, the Irish Primary Principals’ Network recommends parents should be required to agree a “general contract” in which they accept new terms and conditions that balance the safety of the school with their child’s right to an education.The document says pupils may end up having to physically attend school on a limited basis, such as every other day or every other week, and learn remotely on the remaining days. An extended week is also mooted as a possibility.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Irish Hospice Foundation calls for \u0026lsquoa national response\u0026rsquo to end of life care after pandemicSharp rise in cases at Irish meat plants to 828 is concerning, says senior health officialDr David Nabarro cites numbers of cases being suppressed and \u0026lsquodefences building up\u0026rsquoGrass growth has been restricted as there has been little or no rain for the last six weeksJames Hayes (17) wins prize for imaginative essay on the man who discovered QuaternionsCoronavirus: Plans aimed at helping maintain social distancing as city re-opensD\u0026aacuteil vote due as Covid-19 outlay likely to deplete \u0026euro8.6bn budget by June, Donohoe warnsResearch challenges ideas around best scenario for desired foetal developmentDeputy leader Catherine Martin urged to try unseat incumbent from top roleScientific expert group raised concerns over effectiveness, preferring medical masksProf Mary Horgan, who worked with Aids victims in US, cautions against stigmatisingDealgan House had to rely on a volunteer, the grand-daughter of resident, to staff phonesLadbrokes plan would replace Ann\u0026rsquos Bakery with third bookies outlet on historic streetThousands of nurses and doctors from abroad form backbone of our Covid-19 battleLast year Peter Tyndall\u0026rsquos office received the highest number of complaints since 2010Dissident republicans and Ulster Defence Association members made threats recentlyThe number of cases in meat plants has increased by more than 300 to 828Operation on HNoMS Thor Heyerdahl 300 kms off Cork at limit of helicopter\u0026rsquos rangeIrish State alleges Lee Canavan was gunman in 2016 killing of David \u0026lsquoDaithi\u0026rsquo DouglasStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258037.1589956860!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork city set to pedestrianise streets and increase cycle paths","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCork city is set to pedestrianise many of its streets as it reopens during the coronavirus crisis.

According to Cork City Council, the first phase of re-opening of the city involved the pedestrianisation of the Marina near Páirc Uí Chaoimh and the re-introduction of pedestrianisation on Oliver Plunkett Street in the city centre.As part of the second phase of re-opening the city, Cork City Council is proposing the pedestrianisation of Emmet Place, Father Matthew Street, Fitton Street East, Liberty Street, Cross Street, Castle Street and Daunts Square. The council is also looking at expediting snagging work on Harley Street between Patrick’s Quay and MacCurtain Street to facilitate pedestrians using the street once again following the construction of the Mary Elmes Bridge. Cork City Council is also looking at making a number of existing pedestrianised streets one way with Tobin Street, French Church Street and Carey’s Lane all currently being examined as possible one-way movement streets.The option of encouraging pedestrians to move on the right side is also being considered for several pedestrianised bridges including Mary Elmes Bridge, Shandon Bridge, St Vincent’s Bridge, Trinity Bridge and Nano Nagle Bridge. “There will be no impediment on pedestrian movement (on these bridges) but like the London Underground, pedestrians will be encouraged to walk on the right,” said a Cork City Council spokeswoman.CyclingMeanwhile new bike stands are to be located at 43 new locations around the city including several in the city centre as well as in Blackpool and Douglas to encourage people to consider cycling. The city council is also examining the possibility of introducing new bike stands in surrounding towns and villages such as Ballincollig, Tower, Glanmire and Blarney which were incorporated into an expanded city in May 2019.Key cycling routes into the city are under review to identify any improvements to cycling infrastructure that could be implemented while opportunities to convert sites to ‘Park \u0026amp Walk’ facilities are being investigated. Cork City Council Assistant Chief Executive Brian Geaney said the plan has been prepared in conjunction with the government’s re-opening road map for the country as a whole over the next few weeks.Cork City Council also utilised the Cork politan Area Transport Strategy (CMATS) and Cork City Centre Movement Strategy (CCMS) as part of the overriding framework to help revitalise the city.“First and foremost, we want residents, workers and visitors to the city to feel that they can safely practice social distancing in our city and that it is an attractive place to visit during these unusual times.“We started with the city centre but are looking out to the wider new city. Our approach protects health and wellbeing but all proposed interventions will need to be fully considered by all stakeholder interest groups in the city.”Mr Geaney said the Covid 19 pandemic had provided Cork City Council with an opportunity to review its management of the city and rethink the future of the city in a way that boosts quality of life, sustainability and opportunity.“While we are informed by other Irish and international cities, Cork is unique in the way that its homes, workplaces, retail and hospitality are configured and so we need a unique response,” he said. “A street-by-street approach will be adopted in relation to particular on-street proposals. Cork City Council will seek unanimity of purpose as specific mobility measures are proposed for various streets,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258068.1589968801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"meat industry says covid 19 spread a huge learning curve","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosderra Irish Meats plant in Roscrea, Co Tipperary, where, according to Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, by April 30th, 140 workers were out sick and 120 had tested positive. Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneA spokesman for Meat Industry Ireland (MII) has said meat plants will continue to work with the HSE and local control teams to combat the spread of Covid-19.The number of cases in meat plants has increased by more than 300 to 828, according to latest figures from the National Public Health Emergency Team.The sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases related to outbreaks in meat processing plants in the past week was described as “concerning” by Dr Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer, on Tuesday.There are now 16 clusters – defined as two or more cases – across meat processing plants. The issue will be discussed at a meeting of NPHET on Friday.“I fully understand concerns at the unfortunate number of clusters,” he said. Mr Healy said where clusters have occurred the HSE has been engaged in “several of those facilities” and full site screenings have been carried out.Mr Healy pointed out that of the 56 meat plants in the country working under approval from the Department of Agriculture, a significant number had zero cases.On the issue of controls within the industry, Mr Healy said such controls had been put in place from the early days of the virus. “Meat Industry Ireland introduced measures well before the government protocols. We put together our own based on knowledge of best practice.”A “significant suite” of measures are in place, he said, and they are constantly being augmented. When asked about the challenge of meat industry workers living in shared accommodation and if plans were being made to provide alternatives where staff could self isolate, Mr Healy said accommodation was shared across many industries.The work force of Meat Industry Ireland was largely Irish and European with fewer than 20 per cent working in the country under the permit system, he added. The rules apply equally to everyone whether they share accommodation or not, he said.

Photograph:  Dibyangshu SarkarAFP via Getty ImagesHeavy rains and winds lashed two eastern Indian states and parts of Bangladesh hours before a powerful cyclone made landfall on Wednesday, with rescue teams evacuating millions of villagers to higher ground in an operation complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.Bangladesh’s disaster management officials said they were working on a war footing to evacuate about two million people from coastal areas as Cyclone Amphan approached from the Bay of Bengal.“It has been challenging to evacuate people while maintaining distancing. We have doubled the number of the cyclone centres to ensure safe distancing and hygiene,” said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management.Officials said they feared standing crops could be damaged and large tracts of fertile land washed away. Farmers were being helped to move fresh produce and livestock to higher ground.Bangladesh officials also said they had moved away hundreds of Rohingya refugees living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal to storm shelters.An Indian federal home ministry official said West Bengal and neighbouring Odisha state were struggling to house thousands of evacuees as existing shelters were being used as coronavirus quarantine centres.Extra shelters were being prepared in wholesale markets and government buildings with allowances made for social distancing, while masks and scarves were being distributed among the villagers.Police in West Bengal state, which is expected to be badly affected by the storm, said people were unwilling to go to the shelters because they were afraid of contracting Covid-19 and many were refusing to leave their livestock behind.“We have literally had to force people out of their homes, make them wear masks and put them in government buildings,” said a senior police official in West Bengal’s capital, Kolkata.Monoranjan, a resident of Choto Mollakhali island in the Sunderbans area that is expected to bear the brunt of the storm, said the rains could inundate stockpiles of rice.“We are just praying for this night to get over,” he said.Railway officials have erted trains away from the cyclone’s path to protect thousands of migrant workers travelling to Odisha and West Bengal from the capital New Delhi where they had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus lockdown. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"come boris get us thislockdown hole late","story":"The Germans called it the Luftbrücke, an air bridge to take supplies to West Berlin, separated from the rest of the country after the war by the Soviet occupation in the east. With its image of isolation and vulnerability, it is an unfortunate description for what the UK is considering to mitigate the impact of a 14-day quarantine on visitors due to be announced later this week.If this country has been anything down the centuries, it has been open to the world, too open, say some. To cut ourselves off just as our neighbours in Europe are dusting down the café tables and putting out the beach parasols seems bizarre to say the least. Post-Brexit we intended to be global now we are North Korea.If we were in the midst of a plague, this might be sensible and, to be fair, from the start the Government has had to prepare for what its disaster plans call the “reasonable worst-case scenario”. Had you or I been confronted with statistical modelling suggesting that if certain action was not taken, 500,000 people would die and we would be blamed, what would we have done?Of course, it was possible to resist a lockdown and, looking at Sweden, that might have worked had the British responded in the same way. But politically it became impossible for Boris Johnson to hold the line. I get that. The difficulty now, however, is that it is far harder to get people to reclaim their liberties than it was to take them away.The quarantine fiasco is a case in point. It may look good on a graph of projected infections in the months ahead to keep visitors under lock and key, but its first contact with reality exposes its weakness.It means the UK being seen internationally as a place to shun, not to embrace. Who would possibly want that?A better way, surely, would be to test people at the airport and if they have symptoms then they cannot travel. There has to be an alternative, otherwise great chunks of the tourism industry, which accounts for 10 per cent of the economy, are doomed.Even if travel does get going again soon, the social distancing rules (and why are we required to separate by two metres when the World Health Organisation guideline is one metre?) means planes will be only one third full, and therefore prohibitively expensive. The queues at airports, already onerous, will be intolerable.The chief executive of Heathrow estimated that if passengers are made to socially distance by two metres to board a jumbo jet, the line would stretch for half a mile – after you have checked in and gone through security on the same basis.Arriving at the airport more than two hours before a flight always seemed ludicrously early. Now it will be four or even five hours of faffing about. It will take longer than most flights just to get on the wretched aircraft.Mass transit flying does not lend itself to keeping people apart. The economic model is predicated upon cramming us all in. It is not surprising that Michael O’Leary, the boss of Ryanair, is lashing out at the proposed quarantine because it spells the end of his business and that of other airlines.Mr O’Leary is that rare beast in the corporate world, an executive who is not scared to speak his mind, and who does not look over his shoulder at the pursuing Twitterati and its accompanying army of moralistic tut-tutters. He tells it as he sees it and what he sees is a disaster, one caused not by the virus but by the response. He accused the Government of “making stuff up as they go along” and sometimes it is hard to disagree with that observation.One day we are told face masks are pointless the next they are recommended in enclosed spaces. We are urged to go back to work, but then asked not to travel there on public transport. People are encouraged to get some fresh air only to find the countryside dotted with “keep out” signs, as though it belongs to the people who live near it.Patricia Yates, boss of the now-ironically named quango Visit Britain, told a Commons select committee yesterday that business may not be back to normal for two or three years because of a lack of consumer confidence, especially among families and older people. Given that the vast majority of people, even if they contract the virus, will be affected only mildly, the fear is completely out of proportion to the threat. But whose fault is that?The nation desperately needs the bold leadership out of this mess that we thought Boris Johnson could be relied on to provide. Worried about the inevitable search for culprits, our tight-knit Government is too diffident.As an election winner and a Covid victim, the Prime Minister has the political and moral authority to look the country in the eye and say that the risks for the great majority are smaller than had been feared and that, provided we protect the vulnerable, we can get back to normal. Not baby steps, but big leaps forward.

All together.Advertisements bearing the new message started appearing yesterday, together with an image of a rainbow, which has come to represent the public\u0027s gratitude to NHS and care workers during the crisis.The new slogan, released without fanfare, was described by government sources as part of a wider public information campaign around the Stay Alert message, which replaced the more direct Stay Home message.The most recent mantra appears against an amber background, a colour recognised as meaning caution because of its use in traffic lights. Questions had been raised about why the red border around the Stay Home message - clearly indicating danger - had been replaced with a green border for Stay Alert.Opinion polls have shown that only a third of the public claim to understand what Stay Alert means.On May 10, the highly effective Stay Home. Protect the NHS. Save Lives message was replaced with Stay Alert. Control the Virus. Save Lives.On the same day, Boris Johnson announced the easing of some lockdown measures by allowing people more freedom to roam outside, play sports and return to work.While 91 per cent of people said they were clear on what Stay Home meant, just 30 per cent of people surveyed the day after Stay Alert was introduced said they knew what it meant.It left the Prime Minister appealing to good British common sense when it came to people deciding what they should and should not do under the new rules.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust properties taken orcas otters bats rare birds","story":"Wildlife has taken over National Trust properties after they were shut to the public at the beginning of lockdown in March.Now, the organisation is cautiously re-opening some venues, with car park spaces booking up days ahead on the first day the system opened.However, rangers at the sites have enjoyed seeing nature spring into areas which once were busy with humans. Badger cubs have been gamboling in car parks and rare birds including a grasshopper warbler have been seen in areas which are usually busy with dog walkers, which scare away shy animals.Other reports from rangers and gardeners include peregrine falcons nesting in the ancient ruins of Corfe Castle in Dorset for the first time in 40 years, English partridges wandering in an empty car park near Cambridge, and a cuckoo calling at Osterley in west London, having not been heard there for 20 years.David Brown, National Trust ecologist at Corfe Castle, said: “This is the first time peregrines have nested here since the 1980s. With the site the quietest it has ever been, the great curtain walls are an ideal spot for these powerful birds, which look for isolated and inaccessible places to build a nest. Amongst all the uncertainty, it has been heartening to see nature colonising the landscape in our absence.”   On Friday, two male orca were seen in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, and were believed to have travelled in the quieter waters down from the Hebrides.The lakes and gardens, usually thronged with visitors, are now full of curious creatures. Little Owls have been spotted at Ham House, London, and at Plas yn Rhiw, on the Llyn Peninsula, stoats, weasels and hares have come in from the woodland to explore the gardens. Otters too have been spotted enjoying the quiet at Nunnington Hall in Yorkshire and Mount Stewart in County Down, with those at the Northern Ireland site travelling from the lough to explore the lake in the grounds of the neo-classical house. The National Trust is slowly reopening sites, with customers having to pre-book car parking spaces online. Spaces at Nostell, West Yorkshire and Wicken Fen Nature Reserve, Cambridgeshire already sold out until more spaces are released next week.Mo Metcalf-Fisher of the Countryside Alliance said “The countryside thrives when people are able to get out and explore it. As it gradually opens up again, we need to ensure visitors from across the country are signposted to the right places in a way that’s manageable- certainly in the early days as it will inevitably be a rush. Car parks should be opening across the countryside to ensure there isn’t overspill in just a handful of select few places. Central to visiting the countryside comes safety and respect for the countryside code, as it is a home and workplace to so many.”Ben McCarthy, head of conservation at the charity, said that people need to be careful of the rejuvenated wildlife when they come to visit.He said: We would ask everyone who visits to be especially mindful of the wildlife around them.“Over the last few weeks we’ve seen endangered birds, as well as more common wildlife, expanding their territories and nesting in places they wouldn’t normally.“As the lockdown begins to be eased, we all need to play our part to ensure that this wildlife remains undisturbed.“By sticking to paths, keeping dogs under control, not approaching wildlife and taking any litter home, we can ensure our places benefit both people and nature.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rspb volunteers repatriated remote island 12 day boat journey","story":"Among the thousands of enforced journeys home from abroad when the coronavirus crisis hit, few would have been as arduous as that made by a group of bird charity volunteers.Twelve RSPB conservationists, including three Britons, had been looking after the rare albatrosses on Gough Island, one of the most remote locations in the world, around 1,700 miles off the southern tip of Africa.The British Overseas Territory, home to 24 species of rare bird, is overrun with giant mice, which eat the eggs and kill young birds, wiping out as many as two million a year. The rangers had been laying pest poison, and monitoring the unusual animals on Gough.When the crisis broke, they contacted the Foreign Office, and officials worked out an 18-day route, the quickest available, involving first abseiling down the steep cliffs of Gough, then a 12-day sea voyage of nearly 2,000 nautical miles before a five-day layover on Ascension Island waiting to be airlifted back to Brize Norton – via Cape Verde.Kate Lawrence, one of the group, said: “Sailing in that boat for 12 days, looking at the endless blue ocean around me, made the world feel quite big, in contrast to the previous ease of air travel, and the rapid spread of Covid-19, which makes the world seem so small.”When the stranded group originally requested help, multiple routes for them to return home were considered. As the closest, South Africa was the most obvious destination, but rapidly developing travel restrictions there soon ruled it out.The Falklands were seen as the next-best option, but it was at least a 20-day sail away on the expedition yacht, the Evohe, against prevailing winds, and in deteriorating weather conditions.Ms Lawrence added: “We knew the team back in the UK were working on a plan, though the information and plan seemed to change almost daily due to the ever-changing border closures and travel restrictions around the world.”Andrew Callender, programme executive of the RSPB Gough Project, said: “We received incredible support throughout the repatriation process from members of the FCO, the High Commissioner in South Africa and various administrators and representatives of the Overseas Territories, especially in the Falklands and Ascension.”Despite their exhausting and stressful journey, the team hopes to return to Gough next year to save the critically endangered Tristan Albatross from the mice, which were accidentally introduced by humans.They are hoping to raise the finance to continue the mission to eradicate the rodents entirely from the island.Michelle Risi, who works for the RSPB and lives permanently on the island, said: “It was amazing to see how people from all around the world united and bonded. Unfortunately, this time has now come to an end. For us remaining, we are sorry to see their friendly faces go as we prepare for another winter on Gough, which will unfortunately consist of documenting another year of mice impact on Gough’s winter breeders.”     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir tom moore 100 year old fundraising veteran given knighthood","story":"Captain Sir Tom Moore said he was overawed to hear that he will be knighted.To get this honour is so outstanding that I really can\u0027t say how different I feel, but I certainly feel I\u0027ve been given a very outstanding honour by the Queen and the Prime Minister, he told BBC Breakfast.I thank them all very much. I\u0027m certainly delighted and I am overawed by the fact that this has happened to me.Sir Tom added he was looking forward to receiving the honour The Queen, but hoped she wasn\u0027t heavy handed with the sword as I’m a weak soul, he said.The 100-year-old Second World War veteran raised almost £33 million for health service charities by walking laps of his Bedfordshire garden.Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Sir Tom as a true national treasure and praised his fantastic fundraising which he said provided us all with a beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus.Mr Johnson recommended Sir Tom be exceptionally honoured by the Queen, who has approved the honour, Number 10 said.His knighthood comes just weeks after he was made an honorary colonel to mark his centenary and fundraising efforts.On receiving the news, Sir Tom said: “I thought this can’t be true, this would never happen but it seems that it has and I would never have anticipated it.”He joked he may have to issue tickets for those who wish to accompany him to Buckingham Palace for the ceremony, as he expects a lot people will want to go with him.Sir Tom set out to walk 100 laps of his garden in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire before his 100th birthday on April 30, and he completed the laps ahead of time.His initial fundraising target was £1,000, but his determination captured the public imagination during the pandemic and within days he had raised tens of millions of poundHe also released a charity single, You\u0027ll Never Walk Alone, with singer Michael Ball, which reached number one in the charts, making him the oldest artist ever to have a UK number one single.Mr Johnson said: Colonel Tom\u0027s fantastic fundraising broke records, inspired the whole country and provided us all with a beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus.On behalf of everyone who has been moved by his incredible story, I want to say a huge thank you.

Now it appears she was on to something.A report released this week by the Resolution Foundation shows under 25s are more likely to suffer the economic effects of this crisis. One in three have been furloughed or lost jobs completely, or have seen pay reduced. The sort of businesses with predominantly youthful workforces are in the hospitality and retail sectors.With bars, restaurants and shops closed for two months and no clear indication of when they may reopen and under what limitations, waiting staff and shop assistants up and down the country may no longer have jobs to go back to.What’s more, workplaces facing financial struggle under future economic fallout may be looking to cut staff and wages. The adage of ‘last in, first out’ could see senior and more experienced workers with far more accrued employment rights have positions protected, while junior staff walking the tightrope of proving themselves before passing the threshold for certain benefits, discover they are more disposable.But it’s not only in the workplace that the young bear a major cost. A generation of school children, university students and apprentices are being forced to forego the education vital for their future employment before entering what could turn out to be a ravaged economy where jobs are few and far between.Tomorrow’s taxpayers will also be forced to pick up the tab for the massive spend furloughing has required while facing a frightened lending market leaving mortgages further from reach. Flights, rents and a multitude of other costs could inflate to paper over losses for years to come. The gap that already exists between Boomers and their babies is potentially set to widen.When you put that in the context of Covid-19 morbidity, where fewer than 1pc of casualties under forty and the majority of deaths among those over 80, you realise that Government policy, which locked down healthy members of the workforce while allowing Covid-19 to rampage through care homes, may have gotten this very wrong.In the West, the population pyramid is an inverse triangle with a limited number of young bearing the burden of an ageing population. Most European Governments’ Covid-19 responses will necessitate borrowing from tomorrow’s workers to protect the retired population of today. Yet tomorrow’s prosperity comes with no guarantees in the resulting recession Covid-19 will bring.The generational wealth gap has been a hot topic among young, often Left-wing voters for a long time, future voters every party needs to reach. While the Conservatives are often accused of forging pensioner-centric policies, taking advantage of their number and propensity to vote, any prospective government must find solutions for a unique generation facing eye-watering student debt and little personal capital. Add to that higher taxes and mounting unemployment, and you realise that the lasting effects of Covid-19 is on those least likely to suffer the virus.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"science behind three key coronavirus rules does stack","story":"The easing of the UK lockdown will change the way in which we go about our daily lives, with new restrictions placed on travelling, visiting shops and touching objects.But are these restrictions justified, and where did they come from?The two-metre social distancing rule dates back to experiments by Harvard scientist Willam Wells, who was looking at the contagiousness of tuberculosis in the 1930s.Wells found that viruses causing respiratory infections are spread by different-sized droplets expelled by coughs and sneezes. Just one single droplet can be enough to carry an infectious dose and recent research has demonstrated the distances droplets can travel, as shown here:At the beginning of March, the Department of Health released guidance on social distancing warning that coronavirus can be spread when people have close, sustained contact, which typically means spending more than 15 minutes or longer within two metres of an infected person.The new contact tracing app is likely to apply a similar distance and time frame when determining whether people have been in close contact.  However, the 15-minute rule appears to have been lost somewhere in the recent guidance, even though there is no evidence to suggest anyone has ever caught the virus by briefly passing someone when out and about.The World Health Organisation advises a distance of one metre, but other countries have given different guidance:On Tuesday, former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith questioned whether Britain should lower its social distancing advice.Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, he said: We\u0027re the only country, certainly in Europe, that I know of that uses the two-metre rule.I think when it comes to the hospitality sector, I think we do need to look at it very carefully.The Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, recently told the health select committee: The risk at one metre is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at two metres. This gives you an idea of why the two-metre rule becomes important.Transmission depends on both the amount of virus present and the duration and method of exposure.The Government Office for Science says two metres is an instance in which risk drops to an acceptable level for face-to-face interactions such as talking. In this case, a six-second exposure at one metre is comparable to a one minute exposure at two metres.However, being exposed to a cough is significantly more risky than talking to someone.  Exposure at two mteres is comparable to talking for one minute at a one-metre distance and talking for 30 minutes at a two-metre distance.Bookshops have said novels will need to be taken off shelves for three days if they have been flicked through by customers.Surface contamination is a major problem for the spread of coronavirus, and is probably where the vast majority of the new infections are happening. Professor Chris Whitty, England\u0027s chief medical officer, has previously warned that there will be some risk of transmission from touching hard surfaces for up to 72 hours.Humans touch their faces an average of 23 times a day while awake, so the risk of inadvertently transferring a virus through the mouth, eyes or nose is quite high if people are not washing their hands regularly. Non-porous surfaces such as doorknobs, mobile phones, railings and tabletops are better at carrying viruses in general, while every surface has a different half life (the time it takes for the virus cells to degrade by half):A study by the University of Hong Kong, published in The Lancet in April, found the virus lasted longest on stainless steel, plastic, and surgical masks, where it lingered for seven days.The life of the virus was tested in average room temperature of 71F (21C)  at 65 per cent relative humidity, mirroring conditions in the home.Within three hours, it had disappeared from printing and tissue paper but it took two days to die on wood or fabric and four days before it was no longer detectable on glass or paper money. Porous surfaces do not allow viruses to survive as long because the small spaces or holes in them can trap them and stop them from moving.Somewhat worryingly, the team found that, of all the materials tested, coronavirus lasted longest on the outer layer of a surgical mask. John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told members of the House of Lords on Tuesday: There are certain surfaces where the virus can persist for longer, such as metal.Typically with cloth surfaces, the viruses don\u0027 persist as long. At room temperature indoors, the virus can persist for 24 hours or more. Outside is a very different matter. Outside the virus can persist for minutes.The two-week quarantine window was based on the scientific evidence from China that the incubation period before coronavirus symptoms appeared could be as long as 14 days.The timeframe is determined by how long it takes viruses to invade cells in the body and then replicate. Once a virus infects a person, it takes several days to reproduce sufficiently for the host to begin shedding the virus through coughs or sneezes. The incubation period varies from virus to virus, and sometimes from host to host.During early analysis of coronavirus, scientists found that the typical incubation period was around five days, and around 97 per cent of people who got infected developed symptoms within 11 to 12 days. By two weeks, 99 per cent of infected people were displaying symptoms. So it is generally thought that, if symptoms have not appeared within 14 days, it is highly likely that a person is not infected, which is why the Government instructed the following advice and timelines for households concerning self-isolation:On January 27, the Foreign Office issued advice warning travellers who had returned from Wuhan in the previous 14 days to self-isolate. Britons who had been evacuated from the Chinese city were also placed in a 14-day quarantine, and now people returning to the UK will need to stay indoors for two weeks in case symptoms develop.However since those calculations were carried out in January and February, scientists now know that many infected people never show symptoms at all and it is unclear how long they remain infectious. Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham, said: The vast majority of cases are very mild, and therefore that has given the virus the opportunity to transmit in human populations without people realising it\u0027s around.Chinese research has shown that some patients have been infectious for 37 days.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/07/18/gettyimages-1145116193.jpg","title":"australia kangaroos wombats marsiupial lions fossils study","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Pound-for-pound, the\u0026nbspThylacoleo\u0026nbspcarnifex\u0026nbsphad the strongest bite of any mammal – living or extinctPalaeontologists have discovered the remains of what could be the largest kangaroo to have ever walked the earth: a massive marsupial which stood at seven meters tall and weighed around 274kg – approximately half as much as a grizzly bear but three-times as much as the average kangaroo.Researchers from the Queensland Museum and the Australian Research Council also found fossil records of at least 12 other species of enormous animals – called megafauna – including five reptilian megapredator crocodiles which could grow to up to seven metres, and the world’s largest wombats.A marsupial lion called Thylacoleo was also discovered by scientists. This is a carnivorous “pouch lion” which could weigh around 130kg. Pound-for-pound, the Thylacoleo carnifex had the strongest bite of any mammal – living or extinct.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe animals were discovered in an area near Mackay, located on Australia’s eastern coast, called South Walker Creek. It is the youngest megafauna site in Northern Australia, with the huge animals only going extinct approximately 40,000 years ago.However, rather than humans driving the beasts to extinction, there was no evidence placing humans at the scene during the time period. Instead, “successive loss of water flow, intensified drying, increased burning and vegetation change” was the reason for the animals not existing today.Woman killed by alligator after trying to touch animalThe findings, which were published in the journal Nature Communications, were conducted by Scott Hocknull, Richard Lewis, Lee Arnold, Tim Pietsch, Renaud Joannes-Boyau, Gilbert Price, Patrick Moss, Rachel Wood, Anthony Dosseto, Julien Louys, Jon Olley and Rochelle Lawrence.This “40,000-year-old crime scene”, as described by Dr. Hocknull, challenges the theory that human hunting drove the elimination of the large animals.“The megafauna at South Walker Creek were uniquely tropical, dominated by huge reptilian carnivores and mega-herbivores that went extinct… well after humans arrived onto mainland Australia,” Dr. Hocknull also said. Researchers used the animals’ fossilised teeth to determine their age. Chemical elements including, uranium and thorium found in the fossils, placed the giant wombats approximately 25,000 years ago.“No doubt humans would have hunted megafauna and had it for dinner. But these new results show that humans alone didn’t drive megafauna to extinction climate and environmental change was also a big driver,” said Professor Dosetto from the University of Wollongong. Some of these species are newly discovered, so are yet to receive formal descriptions or scientific names.Australia calls on G20 nations to close wet wildlife marketsFinding fossils: An expedition into the heart of Chilean PatagoniaNature has sent us a terrible warning about our futureThe fossils were originally discovered in 2008 over a systematic excavation that revealed other fossils, such as tiny fish scales and huge limb bones. It was found by the Barada Barna – otherwise called the Baranha, an aboriginal tribe of northern Queensland – during a cultural heritage clearance at the site.The site is is currently operated by the mining, metals and petroleum company BHP Billiton Mitsui Coal.“The Board of Directors from the Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation are extremely excited that we have found the Megafauna within our traditional country,” a Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation spokesperson for the Board of Directors said.“The team that discovered these finds back in 2008 had no idea of how great a discovery it was. With the help of Queensland Museum we have discovered more and more animals from that time.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite this, claimant unemployment rose above 2 million in April, the highest level since 1996, and it is very likely that we will see falls in pay in the months ahead.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It gives a shining light of hope to the hundreds of people waiting for a kidney transplant right now, living through coronavirus knowing that fewer transplants are taking place. Like them, we look forward to the time when the full benefits of the new law can be realised.“In the years ahead there will need to be a huge amount of public awareness and education to help people understand the new law and dispel some of the myths surrounding organ donation. Capacity and resource must be built back up so that precious organs do not go to waste for want of an operating theatre or lack of staff.”Anthony Clarkson, director of organ and tissue donation and transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), said: “We hope this law change will prompt all of us to consider whether or not we would want to donate our organs and encourage us all to register and share our decision with our family and friends.”He added that people should be aware they will still have a choice on whether or not to donate, and reassured the public that families will still be consulted, and faith, beliefs and culture will continue to be respected.Acknowledging the increased effect of Covid-19 on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, Kirit Modi, honorary president of National BAME Transplant Alliance, said his organisation is working closely with NHSBT to “carefully consider and work to address any disproportionate impact on BAME patients”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s an approach Theroux has largely maintained throughout his career his unique brand of bumbling, placid interviewing has won him numerous Baftas and international fame.Some of his films are impossibly moving. Others are so ludicrously funny they’ve spawned countless memes and a Twitter account called No Context Louis Theroux.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo mark Theroux\u0027s 50th birthday, here are seven of his most brilliant documentaries…The Most Hated Family in America (2007)This lid-lifting documentary introduces viewers to the Kansas family at the core of the Westboro Baptist Church, whose members believe the US government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality.Tiger King: Louis Theroux says he ‘liked’ Joe ExoticLouis Theroux launches first podcast series from coronavirus lockdownBBC defends Louis Theroux documentary from damning claimsThe hugely controversial Christian ministry is notorious for picketing at military funerals with homophobic placards, claiming that soldiers were killed because God hates gay people.It’s an extremely uncomfortable watch, like much of Theroux’s best work, and a topic that has been revisited twice by the filmmaker in 2011’s America’s Most Hated Family in Crisis and 2019’s Surviving America’s Most Hated Family.This is one of Theroux’s most heart-rending documentaries, in which he interviews dementia sufferers and their loved ones. In it, we meet a 49-year-old mother who is unable to grasp the seriousness of her own deterioration, and whose husband is anxious about raising their young daughter alone.There are moments of lightness, too, with a mischievous 89-year-old called Nancy teasing and flirting with Theroux in some of her more lucid moments.It doesn’t have the shock factor of some of his most famous films, but it’s a poignant insight into how love can endure such a devastating condition.This film sees Theroux head off to Portland, Oregon, to investigate polyamory. It is 60 minutes of perfect awkwardness.Three groups of people of varying willingness to be in open relationships are interviewed, and at one point Theroux strips off and attends a naked “sensual eating workshop”.Drinking to Oblivion (2016)In this staggeringly moving watch, Theroux embeds himself at King’s College Hospital in south London, where he interviews patients whose alcoholism is so severe that it has put them at death’s door.Joe, who is on his third day of detox, is one of the most memorable addicts featured. When we meet him, he’s spent the last few months drinking a bottle or two of vodka a day and is in withdrawal, petrified and hardly able to stand.From 32-year-old Joe to a woman who’s been on eight cans of cider a day for the past three decades, the subjects are very varied in an astonishing film that gives a face to an addiction suffered by half a million people in England.A Place for Paedophiles (2009)Theroux gains incredible access in this unsettling film shot in California’s Coalinga Mental Hospital. More than 500 convicted paedophiles are housed in the institution, many of whom have already served prison sentences but are deemed too dangerous for release.One of the sex offenders there has undergone castration in an attempt to secure his release, while another confessed to molesting 50 children.At the time, Theroux said Coalinga was “the weirdest place” he had “ever been to”, which, coming from a man who has spent time with Nazis, Scientologists and Tiger King’s Joe Exotic, is quite a statement.Louis and the Nazis (2003)This is one of Theroux’s most famous documentaries. It sees the filmmaker travel to California to spend time with the White Aryan Resistance, a group that includes 11-year-old twin sisters who have been taught to sing racist pop songs by their mother. It’s one of the rare films that shows Theroux almost lose his temper. When he comes face to face with the people who are perpetuating so much hatred, he doesn’t look shy or confused as he often does, instead he is genuinely raging.In this left-field festive special, Theroux brings together four of the characters he met during his Weird Weekends series to pull crackers with him in his Brooklyn apartment. From a man who claims to channel messages from the alien planet Koldas to another who spent 28 years living in a hole in Idaho, it’s an eclectic mix of guests. The show will put any chaotic Christmas dinners you’ve had into perspective.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This means the unemployment rate could continue to climb if businesses do not retain the millions of workers placed on furlough during the lockdown.“While only covering the first weeks of restrictions, our figures show Covid-19 is having a major impact on the labour market,” said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In March employment held up well, as furloughed workers still count as employed... Through April, though, there were signs of falling employment as real-time tax data show the number of employees on companies’ payrolls fell noticeably.”So how much would unemployment need to rise in the UK before the impact of the coronavirus begins to compare to other economic crises over the past 100 years?The latest figure of 3.9 per cent remains a long way off unemployment levels following the 2008 financial crisis, when it reached above 8 per cent.And in the 1930s, UK unemployment rose above 20 per cent during the Great Depression – more than five-times higher than current levels.The latest data from the US revealed the biggest surge in unemployment since that period, when it reached a staggering 24.9 per cent in 1933. The US job losses – unemployment currently sits at 14.7 per cent – reflect a severe economic slowdown brought about by businesses shutting down throughout the country as part of containment measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. US figures are expected to remain high, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which forecast that the rate will be 9.5 per cent by the end of 2021 – nearly three-times higher than pre-coronavirus levels.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The novel coronavirus comes from the same family of viruses as that of the common cold.The research, published in Wellcome Open Research and awaiting peer review, looked at data from the England-wide Flu Watch study on viruses similar to Covid-19 between 2006 to 2009.At the start of each winter season, participants were asked to estimate how many times they had washed their hands the previous day.“Good hand hygiene should be practised at all times regardless of whether you show symptoms or not,” added Ms Beale.“This will help protect yourself and prevent unwittingly spreading the virus to others around you.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

hands, think of others, play our part”.Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told Sky News on Wednesday the new messaging – which follows the much-criticised ‘Stay Alert’ slogan – covers the different elements needed to lower the spread of coronavirus as lockdown begins to ease.“Of course the different elements to staying alert, which include washing hands, keeping our distance, builds up to that general approach which is that we all must be very much aware not only of each other but what we can do in order to minimise the inadvertent transmission of this terrible disease,” he said.Share your

Domino Park, a six-acre park located off the East River in Williamsburg, has been covered with white circles meant to encourage social distancing in the era of Covid-19. A video shared online showed residents lounging in the circles, which are about six feet in diameter and spaced away from other circles to remind residents to not interact with others. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“They’ve made little round human parking spots in Domino Park in Brooklyn,” wrote Jennifer 8. Lee in the caption to her video. Three months ago the idea of positioning oneself in a painted circle to lounge outside would be a bizarre concept. But now most residents have embraced the park’s guidelines and followed social distancing measures by only sitting in the circles when on the turf.“If you were to take video footage from the world today and show it to someone from 2019, they would think it was from some near-future Hollywood dystopian television show instead of real life,” Ms Lee said. Pictures taken on Monday also showed a majority of residents using the circles and wearing masks when at Domino Park. The public park is owned by a private company and not operated by New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other government officials have collaborated with the NYPD to encourage residents to practice coronavirus protective measures when outdoors, such as passing out masks at parks. Signs also popped up at a number of parks and locations around the city to remind people to stay apart from others when out. Last week the mayor said there would be limits to capacity of parks like Domino Park, Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and piers 45 and 46 in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park over the weekend. But it was not clear if or how these capacity limits were enforced. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

NASA released the image alongside one of the same star, taken from the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile’s Atacama Desert to compare an image from space with one from the earth.The difference in resolution was plain to see, but it still appeared unfocussed. The press and the public were underwhelmed. They had been promised a full colour panorama of galaxies showing the workings of the universe. The telescope had cost $2.5bn and was only providing marginally better pictures.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEngineers explained that this was part of the calibration process, known as a first light test, to ensure that the optical systems worked. As they calibrated the telescope the quality of the images would improve.Nasa makes landmark announcement about plan to return to the moonHubble Space Telescope breaks in middle of US government shutdownHubble Space Telescope in serious trouble, Nasa saysHubble discovers signs of water on Earth-sized planetsBehind the 2.4m (7.9 feet) wide primary mirror of the telescope’s optical system were 24 pressure pads to make adjustments and correct for any launch damage. However, no matter what the engineers did, nothing appeared to work, and the promised resolution proved elusive.Slowly, after a month of trying, NASA admitted defeat and confirmed that the mirror had a manufacturing flaw and could not be adjusted remotely to compensate for the error. It was not until December 1993, three and a half years later, that the crew of the space shuttle Columbia were able to transport new optical parts to correct the flaw, giving the telescope super sharp resolution and the ability to beam back awe-inspiring photos.As replacing the mirror in orbit was close to impossible, a new optical component, the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) system, was added that effectively acted as corrective spectacles.Four other servicing missions and upgrades were carried out from 1997 onwards, and COSTAR was removed and returned to earth in 2009 once all the original instruments had been replaced with their own corrections built-in. The telescope may now keep functioning until 2030 or 2040, but nevertheless, its successor, the James Webb Telescope, is scheduled for launch in March 2021.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s no truth to that”.“I needed a break. My father just passed. And I retired. And I retired with the notion that I wasn’t going to come back,” said Mr Jordan.His father, James Jordan, was murdered in 1993 after two 18-year-old men shot him and robbed him whilst he napped in his car on the side of the road, authorities determined at the time.In an earlier episode of ‘The Last Dance’, the NBA star had described how his father was also his friend. We were very close, said the 57-year-old during the seventh episode of the show, in which family members and friends commented on the impact of the death on the star’s career.

West Bengal is evacuating 300,000, and the neighbouring state of Odisha said it had moved almost 150,000 people to shelters.Videos posted on social media showed heavy rainfall along the coast and trees whipping back in the wind. Earlier posts showed people carrying belongings - and wearing face masks to protect themselves from Covid-19 - heading to storm shelters.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Between them, India and Bangladesh have more than 130,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, and there are concerns that the storm will put additional strain on medical and emergency services and potentially boost the virus\u0027s spread.Dr Saleemul Haq from the Independent University of Bangladesh said that while Bangladesh has a strong network of cyclone warning systems and shelters, it will be almost impossible for the evacuated population to practise social distancing in such conditions.Charities are particularly concerned for the fate of the sprawling, densely populated Rohingya refugee camps at Cox\u0027s Bazar in Bangladesh, the largest camp of its kind in the world housing almost a million refugees.Cyclone Amphan is a crisis on top of a crisis, said Pankaj Anand, Oxfam India\u0027s humanitarian response director. Many of the cyclone evacuation shelters are already being used as coronavirus quarantine centres or housing migrants who have returned to their coastal communities because of lockdown. People are worried there won’t be enough space in the shelters and that they might catch coronavirus in them.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just hope it passes soon, without destroying our town, he told the Associated Press.Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, ordered the closure of shops and the streets to be cleared on Wednesday - effectively a one-day resumption of the tight coronavirus lockdown from which the city had only just started to emerge. Officials warned the city was likely to see some flooding, and that centuries-old buildings to the north of the city were at risk of collapse.In Digha, the district of West Bengal where the storm was due to make landfall, Wednesday morning had already brought more than 44mm of rainfall. Many in the seaside resort town felt they were forced to choose between risking the virus or the storm, said fisherman Debasis Shyamal.The cyclone is also occurring during the Islamic holy month Ramadan, and reports from Muslim-majority Bangladesh said many villagers were fasting all day Tuesday, then eating at night before heading for the shelters early Wednesday.The region is no stranger to devastating cyclones, but scientists say the intensity of their wind speeds has increased due to climate change and warming in the region.Scores died last year during Cyclone Fani, the largest cyclone to hit Odisha state since the turn of the century. Simon Wang, Professor of Climate, Utah State University, said we don\u0027t yet know whether last year\u0027s record storm activity in the Bay of Bengal was an outlier year or a year that portends things to come.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Stanley School, Teddington, West London, closed during lockdown on May It also said schools should look at bringing in a one-way system in corridors, or putting a ider in the middle to control the flow of kids.Ministers admitted they cannot keep kids two metres away from each other all day, so each class will form a self-contained bubble so they dont mix with other kids at the schools.But union boss Kevin Courtney tweeted on May : Education unions intend to work together.Dont engage with planning a June stto wider opening - await further union advice.Meanwhile, General Secretary of The National Association for Head Teachers Paul Whiteman told the Education Select Committee: If social distancing is as we understand it now - the two metre rule to be applied in schools - there are very many schools that are saying it is simply impossible to achieve.He said making sure younger year groups stay at least two metres apart from each other and their teachers and practice good hygiene such as hand washing will be particularly dficult. Schools have been closed since March  - three days before Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown.No has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.A spokesman for No said: While we will not penalise [parents] for keeping children at home, once children are eligible toto school we will strongly encourage them to do so.Dr Bousted urged the Government to meet tests set out by unions, which includes extra money for deep cleaning and personal protective equipment and local powers to close schoolsclusters of infections break out.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on May  it was completely natural for parents to worry about sending their kids back to school.

and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.Taking London as an example, with a current R value of . for coronavirus, it means that for every ten people who have the virus, it will be passed on to only four more people.The low R value means thateveryone continues lockdown and social distancing measures, London would theoretically be virus free by the end of May. The World Health Organisationestimated at the start of March that the coronavirus R stood somewhere between  and ..The UK is now generally below that because of the lockdown and the social distancing measures we have been doing over the past two months.In comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly . while measles has a reproductive value of between  and .Despite this, these figures are not set in stone because a given pathogens R value changes with place and time.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told The : R is an indication of how much an infectious virus will spread in a population, and ious things impact that value.The susceptibility, size and density of the population that the infection is introduced into matters, as well as the infectiousness of the virus itself.Predictions of the R for Covid- are currently ied because no one knows exactly how many people have been infected in total.According to modelling published by Imperial College London, the R value stood somewhere between  and . in Europe before lockdowns came into effect.The most recent estimate of the nation-wide R-rate is said to be between . and .Below R is the important bit because it means the virus will likely peter out, but things are generally worse in the north of England to the point that the trend could reverse.New data released May  from Cambridge University suggests that in the North East and Yorkshire the R rate - the average number of people an infected person can pass the virus on to - is feared to be at around ..The South West has an R rate of ., slightly more than the North West which has a rate of ..Both the East of England and South East have a rate of ., followed by the Midlands with . and finally London with ..On May , , Boris Johnson urged the British public to help reduce the R value.In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.He continued: And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.During one of the Downing Street press conferences, Sir Patrick Vallance revealed that it was highly likely there is an R value in the community of less than one.This means that every infected inidual passes the disease to less than one other person.This shows the lockdown has had a positive impact on the coronavirus outbreak as to bring an outbreak under control the R value needs to fall below one.However, when the number remains higher than one, the epidemic will grow. Sir Patrick admitted that the R value could be higher in some care homes and hospitals.He said: As I’ve said, it’s not true that the R is necessarily below one in every hospital or in every care home, and that’s the important area that we now need to look at and make sure that the appropriate measures are in place to try and reduce the R there.But it doesn’t change the overall view that I’ve described, that the R overall is below one and therefore we expect to see the slowing and the turn of the epidemic.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.Sir Patrick said that the draconian social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is less chance for the virus to spread.He said on Thursday, April : The social distancing measures are needed to reduce the levels right down to a low level.At that point there may be decisions about which ones to relax and which ones not to relax.It’s important to keep the R below one, and this is all about trying to reduce contacts, particularly between households, reduce transmission and keep the levels low across the community.And Sir Patrick added that even small changes in the measures that are in place could lead to the R going above one.According to a pre-print study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the average number of people an inidual comes into contact with each day has dropped by  per cent since the UK’s lockdown began.“This would be sufficient to reduce R from a value from . before the lockdown to . during the lockdown, indicating that physical distancing interventions are effective,” the study, which tracked over , adults and has not yet been peer reviewed, concluded.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must remain shut until a later date.Public transport must be avoided, according to the new lockdown rules, although reports have shown packed buses and trains in parts of the country.Brits are now allowed to meet people who are not members of their household, providing they follow social distancing guidelines.Funerals are still allowed to go ahead with a limited amount of attendees, of immediate family members.The rules on exercising have also been changed with people now able to take unlimited outdoor exercise.With the approach of summer, people are also now able to go to the park to sunbathe and must follow social distancing measures. The Government announced the lockdown on March .In an unprecedented move, Brits were ordered to stay at home with the exception of key workers, while non-essential shops and facilities such as restaurants, gyms and pubs were instructed to shut.Schools were also closed as a result of the lockdown rules.The restrictions were due to last for three works but were extended following review and advice from ious communities and departments.Lockdown measures are expected to last into June and may go beyond that, following guidelines by the government.Social distancing rules are however, expected to be in place beyond that.Mr Johnson has indicated that he wants the UK to resume near normality by July.He has said this would depend on whether the public abides by the new lockdown rules.Measures are currently being eased in phases with the final steps being the reopening of non-essential businesses.The earliest these final steps will be taken is July , according to the Governments -page action plan for leading the country to a new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled.

This is about ‘safe’ being an acceptable level of risk.”Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientic adviser, said an effective track and trace system was needed to isolate those infected by the coronavirus before changes were made to lockdown rules.She told The Times that this should be based on observed levels of infection . . . and not on a fixed date.And scientist John Edmunds, another member of SAGE, told Sky News that a track and trace system must be embedded and working well before schools re-opened.Teaching unions are opposed to the Governments plan to re-open schools on June , claiming teachers, pupils and their families will be at risk of catching the deadly virus.They were backed last week by the British Medical Association, who said unions were absolutely right to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on June .BMA councils chair, Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA councils chair, said at the time: We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union , refused to back down on Tuesday, saying: “Our current assessment is that schools aren’t safe to open, as our five tests have not been met.Butour five tests are met, then on a national level, it would be permissible to go ahead with reopening schools.”According to the Daily Mail, its leaders were caught making a series of slurs in a Zoom meeting last night.The video footage exposed the joint general secretary Mary Bousted accusing children of being mucky by spreading germs and wiping their snot on peoples clothes.The hard-line leaders also discussed how to threaten head teachers should they try to get their staff back to work.The NEU’s five tests include lowering the number of virus cases, plans for social distancing, more testing, strategies for entire schools and protection for the vulnerable.COUNCILS or teachers who refuse to reopen schools on June  wont be fined, Priti Patel has declared.The Home Secretary today insisted it was not the right approach to slap those against the Governments plan with fines.She said: “First of all, we are not at the st of June yet, we have time to work together.Its wrong to sort of say well X needs a sanction or Y needs a sanction.But Ms Patel insisted there does need to be a pragmatic solution.She added: Guidance has gone to schools already in terms of smaller classroom sizes, staggering lunch times, bringing in practical measures.“I think we have to be practical and pragmatic about this.”The reopening of primary schools could be delayed beyond June  as local authorities yesterday advised their schools to stay closed, including the first Tory-run council.The Government made clear today that every school’s circumstances were dferent and thata head teacher felt unable to open next month, they should “discuss options” with their local authority or trust.It comes as France makes a mockery of British demands, with teachers ing to French schools wearing masks and taking simple extra precautions.They are among  European to countries which have re-opened classrooms - and evidence suggests that doing so has not been harmful to kids or teachers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The animal was pursued across a field by a pack of dogs as mounted riders were nearby. Campaigners released the video, which was filmed in November, after police and prosecutors decided against taking action against the hunt involved. The shocking film, which lasts one minute,  seconds, shows two riders and about a dozen dogs near a hedge on the edge of a field.  After about a minute, the hounds break off and begin barking as they run down the field. Eventually a fox can be seen running away towards a tree, while a horn can be heard in the background. Sheep in a neighbouring field can be seen running away, and the dogs skirt the edge of the first field along the hedgerow before the footage breaks off. The incident, which unfolded near Okeford Fitzpaine, Dorset and appeared to involve the Portman Hunt, was filmed by Wildle Witness and reported to police. A Wildle Witness spokesman said: “It is sickening to watch this happening  years after hunting was banned. “The legislation needs tightening to prevent foxes being subjected to such terror.  “We will continue to monitor the activities of hunts and bring in to the public domain the reality of what is happening in our countryside.” Hunting with hounds was banned on February ,  following the  Hunting Act’s approval by Parliament. But trail hunting, where where riders accompanied by hounds follow a scent along a pre-determined route, is allowed. It is meant to replicate a traditional hunt but without a fox being chased, maimed or killed. Dorset Police confirmed it received a report “in relation to an alleged illegal fox hunt that had been witnessed in the area of Okeford Fitzpaine near Blandford”.  A force spokesman said a “local officer carried out an investigation into the incident and two men attended for voluntary interviews with officers”. The spokesman added: “Evidence was compiled and following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, a decision was made not to bring any charges in relation to the case. “Dorset Police will investigate any alleged breached of the Hunting Act  and other legislation and will work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to determinea case could be taken to court. “Hunting mammals with dogs has been illegal since .  “A few, very specic, exemptions apply. “We would urge anyone with clear evidence of such offending to please report it to us.” A spokesman for the Portman Hunt said: “The Portman Hunt operates within the law by carrying out lawful trail hunting activities. “As has been proven on numerous occasions in court, the evidence provided by anti-hunting activists almost always fails to support their claims of illegal hunting activity. “This has been proven yet again by the authorities investigating this case who have said there will be no further action. “Anti-hunting activists are aware that the circulation of their edited footage online using social media s can amply their highly emotive messages, regardless of the facts, but this often results in hundreds of hours of wasted police time, which is totally unacceptable.” League Against Cruel Sports campaigns director Chris Luffingham said: “If ‘trail’ hunting is real then in no circumstances should animals be chased by hounds, it simply wouldn’t happen.

Ms Hobhouse, , said: This is a good decision for the Liberal Democrat Party.\u2028“The election review that came out over the weekend was tough reading, but it was honest, and shows that we need to make some big changes.

Robert Buckland accepted we needed to make a choice about what to do with the capacity the government had back in March. The Justice Secretary added there are now huge issues in care homes - at least % of which have a Covid- outbreak with more than , deaths. He told Sky News: We’ve seen a great tragedy in our care homes which is a matter of huge regret. It is a rare admission from the government that it was a choice to stop widespread testing in care homes.  Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall said: This is the clearest admission yet that ministers did not give care homes the protection they needed at the start of this pandemic.“Social care and the NHS are both equally important in the fight against this virus and are inextricably linked. One cannot be prioritised above the other. “Ministers must give social care the resources, support and attention it needs to stop the spread of this awful virus.”Care home residents, new arrivals and staff with symptoms were not routinely tested from mid-March, when community testing ended due to lack of capacity, to April . Testing has since ramped up to around , a day and there has been a pledge to test all staff and residents, even without symptoms - but that will only be fully rolled out by June . Until April , not even new arrivals into care homes from hospitals were routinely tested. Only last night one Cabinet minister, George Eustice, insisted: We don’t accept the caricature that we took an approach that was wrong. But Dame Angela McLean, Chief Scientic Advisor to the Ministry of Defence, said bluntly: With the testing we had, the right thing to do was to focus it on people who were really sick in hospital. It was the right thing to do at the time.  And today Mr Buckland accepted it was a choice to test in the NHS over care homes. Asked what mistakes the government made, he told Sky News: Well I think we widely emphasised the importance of making sure our NHS services and our hospitals were places that could continue to admit patients and wouldnapost be incubators of the disease. We achieved that, we protected our NHS, we ramped up our capability, which meant it didnapost thankfully fall over at a time of huge pressure. Askedhe was saying the government focused on the NHS to the detriment of care homes, he replied: Well look, I think we needed to make a choice about testing, and we did decide to focus upon the NHS.  I think the issue with care homes is that we’ve got many thousands of dferent providers, dferent settings. There have been lots of examples of care homes that have mercully stayed infection free, but sadly far too many cases of infection and death. I think every country in the world will look back and say there were things we could have done dferently, but I think now weaposve got to focus on the here and now.

Areas which were already among the worst off suffered most, the Institute for Employment Studies said. Torsten Bell, chief executive of living standards think-tank the Resolution Foundation said it showed “Britain’s jobs crisis has now arrived”. Calling for more support for young people he urged the Government to “repair our social security safety net” to protect those facing financial ruin. But Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds warned: “Unfortunately, these claimants will now discover the UK has one of the weakest out-of-work safety nets in the developed world.” It came as the number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus rose by  to , and figures suggested around , elderly care home residents have died. Gordon Brown lashed out at an apparent lack of leadership, with Boris Johnson “hiding” from the public recently. Mr Johnson, seen ing from a run yesterday, has led the daily Downing Street briefing just twice since going back to work on April . He has given one Commons statement on the pandemic since it began. While Mr Brown said he would “take into account” the fact Mr Johnson had been ill, he insisted he needed to tell Parliament his strategy for protecting lives and jobs. Mr Brown said: “He has got to get a grip on the testing and he has got to get a grip on what is going to happen to the economy as it moves forward.” The Government is also facing growing pressure from councils and teaching unions to reconsider plans to open primary schools in England. Experts have predicted the unemployment rate could eventually hit %, up from .%. And Mr Sunak told the House of Lords Treasury Committee via video­link “the jury is out” on what the economy will look like after the crisis.  “I certainly won’t be able to protect every job and every business,” he said. “We’re seeing [it] in the data and no doubt there will be more hardship to come. We are likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen.” The Institute for Employment Studies said many of the areas worst hit by the rise in unemployment were in the North West of England. In Blackpool, % are now “claimant unemployed”, up from % in March. Elsewhere, one in  residents are claimant unemployed in Middlesbrough, South Tyneside, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Thanet, Kent. In another sign of the bleak employment landscape, there was a record fall in job vacancies, down , to , in the three months to April. There are also fears over the effect that increased unemployment will have on the nation’s health.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said a % rise could lead to a further one million people developing chronic health conditions. Unemployment was already on the rise, climbing by ,, to . mil­­lion in the three months to March. The number of paid employees plunged by , at the start of April to . million but this excluded eight million currently furloughed. Calling for more support for young people Mr Bell also warned against a sharp clf-edge end to furlough.

Keri Rennison, , a mental health nurse, lives with fiancé Chris Westoby, , as well as her daughter Rosie, , and her parents Paul, , and Jackie, . But their family le changed drastically when every family member contracted covid-, forcing each of them to self-isolate in their own rooms. Keri says because she and Chris are keyworkers, they must have brought it into the house, highlighting that living in a multi-generational home during lockdown has its downside as well as the obvious advantages. Chris, who works in food processing, had developed a cough over a couple of days, and shortly after father-in-law Paul started feeling unwell.Speaking to HullLive, Paul said: Me and Jackie had come home from the allotment and I didnapost feel very well.I cooked Sunday lunch, it was roast beef but my heart just wasnapost in it. I sat down to eat and said I don’t want this - which just isnapost me. I took myself to bed and then didnapost get out for nearly two weeks. While Paul struggled with the early stages of the virus, Keri and Chris continued working, as they were both key workers. Speaking about the living situation, with her parents moving into their home in Hull back in , Keri couldnapost help but worry about the impact of their work on the household. She said: It’s a positive weaposve been able to lockdown together but the negative is, itaposs either myself or Chris whoaposve brought the virus in as key workers - thereaposs that realisation thatwe didnapost live in this way my dad might not have got it. Chris added: The positive side is that we were there to care for him. If he was ill somewhere  and we couldnapost see him that would have been terrible. But as Paulaposs symptoms persisted, the family decided to completely isolate, with Keri and Jackie taking it in turns to test his temperature. On Thursday, April , however, he took a turn for the worse. Jackie said: We were doing these tests and thinking please don’t let it reach this and please don’t let it reach that. It was so scary. If I’d had been on my own I would have gone to pieces completely because I didnapost know what to do, Keri took charge and she saw to it all. When paramedics arrived, they decided Paul needed to go to the hospital. Rosie said: It was really scary. He didnapost say much, just ‘I’ll see you soon’. But at that point how do you know you’re going to see someone again because you hear of people going in and never coming out again. He was a shell of the man he is - it really broke my heart.  Jackie said: It was awful. I turned to Rosie and I said aposIaposm never going to see him againapos. It still upsets me.Paul was given a coronavirus test, which came back positive, but thankfully, his condition was not bad enough to warrant a stay overnight on the Covid ward.He was sent home, but the rest of the family quickly came down with coronavirus symptoms. As a key worker, Keri was able to get tested and the result came back positive, confirming that it had spread through the house. Chris said: It was terrible. I was better by then and I was asking peopleI could do anything or make them things to eat but nobody wanted anything. It was so strange, like nothing Iaposve ever experienced before. Keri said that none of her family had either of the major symptoms of a persistent cough and a high fever. She said: It started with a loss of taste and sense of smell that has only just come back but itaposs still very, very weak. And then I had fatigue and a headache for seven days after. My father was really the only one who had any sort of respiratory dficulties, which was just shortness of breath when he spoke. But as a family we realised that weaposre very, very lucky to have only got the symptoms mild and survived it. Most of all weaposre really thankful.

Haven, Center Parcs and Butlin’s are drawing up plans to adapt their sites to cater for families’ “pent-up demand to get away” while sticking to vital social distancing rules.They are hoping the Government clears holiday parks and resorts to reopen in July – under what would be Phase Three of Boris Johnson ’s plan to ease us out of lockdown and reboot the hospitality sector.It comes after Visit Britain said the domestic market, worth £billion, has already lost £billion as a result of Covid- measures. The group wants families to make  the “year of domestic tourism”. Acting chief executive Patricia Yates told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee: “To get British tourism up and running this summer – and the summer is hugely important – you’re going to need that domestic audience.” She added there was “a real job to be done” to convince people it is acceptable to “enjoy a holiday and that it’s safe to do so”. But figures from coolcamping. com, covering  locations, show summer bookings for campsites have soared % in the past week. The website said: “There’s clearly a pent-up demand to get away. The mooted date of July  is ideal timing for summer and could save many businesses who have had no income.” Rethinks on how resorts and parks operate will help reassure people mulling a staycation. Haven says planned measures range from Perspex screens at reception and info desks to check-ins from home. On-site grocery stores will have the same social distancing rules as supermarkets, while restaurants will just do takeaways and deliveries. Hand- washing stations will be dotted around all  parks and there will be reduced numbers on sites – with communal areas like swimming pools will staying closed.Haven said: “Our prices have been adjusted to recognise the revised experience. We’ve made signicant changes, which we anticipate will allow us to open as soon as Government deems it safe. We’ll comply with coronavirus restrictions.”Center Parcs, which has six UK sites, is also hoping to reopen in July and said holidaymakers could expect to see “some changes”. A spokesman said: “We are reviewing the whole experience to ensure we can open with appropriate social distancing as well as any other measures required to keep our staff and guests safe. “We know we can adapt and provide reassurance to guests and staff, and will only reopen when the time is right. When we do, we are confident we will provide a great guest experience for families.” Butlin’s said fewer people would be allowed in entertainment venues and it would increase the number of shows. There will be more sittings for meals as well as extra events so that kids do not miss out on activities. The firm said: “We are awaiting guidance as to when we can reopen. “In the meantime, we’re using all of the skills and creativity of our team to plan a break that keeps everyone safe.” The Camping and Caravanning Club, which represents , sites, said caravanners will park six metres apart and tents will also be pitched with large gaps between them. Its plans include asking campers and caravan owners to bring their own portable loos so toilets can stay closed. Bosses offered to do a trial reopening after losing £million of bookings due to Covid-. Camping and Caravanning Club director general Sabina Voysey said: “We’re well-placed to offer socially-distanced holidays and eager to work on trial schemes for how campsites may reopen with all necessary measures. “We urge the Government to provide greater clarity on how the sector can safely open and operate.” The plans to get staycations firmly on the radar emerged as airlines slammed a bid by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to boost uptake of foreign holidays as unworkable. Mr Shapps raised hopes of travel to top hotspots by striking up no-quarantine deals, or “air bridges”, with countries where infection rates are low. Britain’s biggest tour operator, Tui, said it hopes to kick-start the season from June . The firm got a boost after Portugal and Greece revealed they were willing to relax quarantine restrictions for Britsit was a two-way system. Algarve Tourism Board head Joao Fernandes said: “If British holidaymakers are allowed to fly to countries with low infection rates via ‘air bridges’, without having the need for quarantine, the Algarve will be the place to be.” But airlines said the scheme was at odds with the Government’s two- week quarantine rules for anyone coming into the UK, effective from next month, and a Foreign Office ban on non-essential travel abroad. The PM’s official spokesman said air bridges were “an option under consideration but not agreed policy”.

Troy House in Monmouth originates from the th century and the Grade II listed four storey dream home comes complete with a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, adding to an imposing portfolio of properties which also included Great Castle House in Monmouth and Badminton House in Gloucestershire.

He still cycles to restaurants and takeaways, picks up the food then rides to the customeraposs house to drop it off. But the reason behind many of his orders is now dramatically dferent, and heaposs no longer just delivering a lazy dinner but providing an essential service to the most vulnerable people in our community. Since lockdown was brought in, the delivery company has started working with convenience shops to take groceries to people who are self-isolating or shielding.  Robin, , has been a driver with the delivery company for four years, but admits he did consider quitting when the lockdown was introduced. He told : There were a couple of days when I felt like I really didnapost want to go out, but then as time passed I realised that I should. I was more concerned at the start, it was just a complete shock. It was a shock for everybody. People are so grateful for us to bringing their stuff to them. Itaposs a great feeling, it feels like youaposre contributing to keeping people safe. People used to order for a treat but now theyaposre ordering because they really need stuff and they donapost want to leave their house.  One moment that sticks in his mind is when a customer left him a thank you note and a chocolate bar to thank him for dropping groceries off to her. The note said: Hereaposs a wee treat to get you through the rest of your sht. Robin, who has been a Deliveroo driver for four years and lives with his girlfriend, who is also a key worker, said: Iaposve never been tipped in chocolate before. It was so nice and I really wasnapost expecting it. Itaposs good knowing youaposre helping people.  Robin does everything he can to protect himself and customers while out delivering, like all his Deliveroo colleagues. He uses hand sanitiser before entering and once heaposs left each restaurant, and does the same as he arrives at the customeraposs house. While there have been a lot more orders, the quieter roads have made the actual delivering part of the job much easier. Robin said: Weaposre not seeing as much of the customers, itaposs down from about  per cent to about  per cent. Weaposre leaving the food on the doorstep. But thereaposs still a little bit of contact from a distance. His fellow driver Alex Smith, , delivers in Horsham alongside his university studies.  He knew he wanted to carry on working as soon as he saw how grateful people were, and heaposs made a mini documentary about his time out delivering. He said: I was determined to carry on. I did it for a little bit, and then I saw how important it was to vulnerable people. Being able to help someone is really nice. There are vulnerable people who canapost get food, and being able to deliver to them is important. People are saying thank you for working, it just made me think that someone has got to do it and I want to be the one to do it.  What I like most is how grateful people are. People are really nice when youaposre dropping off. Like Robin, Alex is making sure heaposs doing everything he can to keep customers safe and following all the procedures, but admits he tries not to think about the personal risk. He said: Maybe I am more at risk but I donapost mind, people need to eat.

The -year-old heart swap boy spoke as experts revealed the coronavirus crisis has led to a slump in transplants. It comes as Max and Keira’s Law on opt-out donation is rolled out across England on Wednesday – after a four-year campaign by the Mirror. Max said: “I would say to people today… don’t waste your organs when you die.” Ethan,  months, has been waiting in hospital for a heart since August to replace his enlarged one. The brave -year-old urged more people to consider becoming donors – on the eve of the opt-out rule bearing his name and that of the little girl who saved his le being adopted in England.  As doctors prepare to start ramping them up again, Max pleaded: “If you can save lives when you die, why wouldn’t you ” One of those lives is -month-old Ethan, who has been waiting for a heart since August to replace his enlarged one. The tot is hooked up to an articial heart as mum Roseleila and dad Richard look on helplessly. Max and Keira’s Law, which came after a four-year campaign by the Mirror for an opt-out rule, does not apply to under s and parents still have to give permission for doctors to use their children’s organs. But Roseleila and Richard could face an even longer wait due to the ­coronavirus pandemic.  Some patients have had to be taken off the transplant list because the risk to them of receiving an organ is too high. No one who dies showing Covid- symptoms can donate. Those who are able to be treated, such as kidney patients on dialysis, may be expected to wait longer for operations. But those in dire need of transplants, who would die without an organ, will still have surgery. Max was given his heart by the family of nine-year-old Keira Ball, who died in a car accident near her home at ­Barnstaple, Devon, in . She also saved three others. His parents Paul, , and Emma, , and Keira’s mum Loanna and dad Joe are working hard to raise awareness of the new law – which was inspired by their children. Loanna, , who was seriously injured in the crash that killed her daughter, said: “Max and Keira will be remembered long after we are gone. “This law is so important. They really will go down in history, they will never be forgotten. That means so much.” The couple’s charity, Inspired by Keira, is helping bereaved parents cope with the loss of a child. And they worked tirelessly to help the , currently on the organ donor list. Loanna and Joe also work hard to reassure parents who might consider organ donationthe ­unthinkable were to happen, and they were to lose a child. Paul and Emma, of Winsford, Cheshire, wrote a book called Golden Heart, in which they vividly describe the ordeal of parents whose children are on the transplant list. For Max, it was nine months on a ward at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital looking out of the window, wonderingand when he might be saved.  Even at , he was thinking of others, admitting he might not make it. But he still believed the new law was right. For five-year-old Frankie Lord, who was in the Freeman at the same time as Max and featured in the Mirror on Tuesday, it was a -month wait for his parents Sophie and Chris as they watched the agony of their little boy clinging to le. Emma said: “What I say to people is how would you feel about organ ­donationyour child needed an organ  “If one of your loved ones needed a transplant, would you accept a donor organ  I think that is the best way of looking at it…you would take one, you should be prepared to give.”  Civil servant Paul added: “Max has never forgotten the children on the ward who did not make it. “He remembered them when we decided to join the Mirror campaign almost exactly three years ago. And he still remembers them now.” Max, who has a -year-old brother, Harry, has formed an unbreakable bond with Loanna and Joe and their ­children Bradley, , Katelyn, , and -year-old Keely – who he calls his “second family”. Both the Johnsons and Balls paid tribute to Mirror readers, who backed our campaign to reform the organ law – which now assumes everyone is a donor unless they opt out.  Experts believe it will give surgeons  more organs to ­transplant ­annually, saving hundreds of lives each year. Thousands signed up to join the organ donor register, and petition Parliament for change. It was backed by footballer Andy Cole – who received a kidney from his nephew Alexander Palmer – surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub, The British Heart Foundation, Kidney Care UK, the British Medical Association and Kaylee Davidson-Olley, the first successful and longest surviving baby transplant in Europe after receiving her heart at just five months old. NHS Blood and Transplant had a huge rise in the number of donors signing up. Its medical director for organ ­donation, John Forsythe, said: “As the situation with Covid- is ever changing, so is the picture regarding donation and transplantation. “Some units have made the dficult decision to close their transplant programmes for now. This to support the NHS in treating Covid- patients.  “Lesaving transplants are still going ahead as long as clinical staff feel it is safe. Transplant teams will talk to patients and balance their need against the additional challenges of being immunosuppressed at this time and the challenges being faced within the NHS at this moment.” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Coronavirus has vividly reminded us that le is a precious gt, one that we must do all we can to treasure and protect. “It’s why the new organ donor opt-out law, which comes into force today, is so important.” How Mirror helped bring in donor law April  Teddy Houlston became Britain’s youngest donor, donating his organs after dying aged just  minutes. It led to more than , people signing the organ donor register.  December  The soft opt-out system comes into force in Wales after a  law change. The Daily Mirror launches its Change the Law for Le campaign calling for legislation change in England too.  July  Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson came up in the Private Members’ Ballot and chose to use it to change the law to presumed consent in England.  September  We revealed that  Brits could have been saved that yearan opt-out system had been in place.  October  Prime Minister Theresa May gave the bill government backing.  February  The bill finally becomes law after passing its final hurdle in the House of Lords. A huge public information campaign begins to let people know thatthey do not opt out, it is assumed that they consent to donate. May  The law comes in to force. Transplants up after Covid- shutdown By Health Editor Martin Bagot Lesaving transplants are being ramped up again as Max and Keira’s Law comes in to force on Wednesday. Most operations had been delayed due to fears vulnerable patients might contract Covid- during surgery. And health minister Lord Bethell has said that while NHS bosses had no choice but to impose the policy many organs had been “wasted” as a result. Care minister Helen Whately told the Commons yesterday “over , people in England are waiting for a transplant”. She said: “During the peak of the pandemic, there were many days that there were no transplants. “As of last week there have been  referrals,  donors and  transplants. “We have a duty now more than ever to push ahead with measures that will reduce human suffering and help people improve their quality of le. “That is exactly what this law does.” The law presumes all adults in England agree to be donors unless they opt out. Anthony Clarkson, of NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “We hope this will prompt all of us to consider whether or not we want to donate our organs.” Fiona Loud, of Kidney Care UK, said it “gives a shining light of hope” to the hundreds needing a kidney transplant. “Capacity and resource must be built back up so that precious organs do not go to waste.”  aposHave that conversation for kids like my Ethanapos By Julie McCaffrey and Grace Macaskill All day and night, Roseleila Eaves has her phone on full charge, the ringtone set to loud and always within easy reach. Becausea call comes to say a donor heart has become available, -month-old son Ethan’s le depends on it. The tot has been in Great Ormond Street Hospital since August last year and is hooked up to an articial heart. All he knows is that the cannulas get in the way of his crawling practice. He is blissfully unaware they are keeping him alive until a tiny heart transplant takes place. His family, who have been warned the coronavirus outbreak means longer waits for transplant ops, are appealing for parents to talk about donation should the worst happen.  Roseleila, , from Luton, says: “I can only imagine how raw and devastating a conversation about organ donation could be when a parent has just lost a child. “But NHS studies have found many parents have said in hindsight they would have agreed. “Many young lives would be savedthose conversations were had now. Talk to each other and talk to your childrenthey’re old enough, so you know their wishes. Today, the day Max and Keira’s Law comes into force, marks  days since Ethan’s been on the urgent transplant list.” Ethan was diagnosed with an enlarged heart in August , seven months after engineer dad Richard, , had a transplant for a dferent heart condition. He was born a healthy lb oz and when sent for a routine heart test because of his family background was given the all clear. But on the couple’s first wedding anniversary on August , Ethan was rushed to hospital after falling ill and an X-ray found his heart was enlarged. In a -hour op, Ethan was wired to a mechanical heart after his own began beating dangerously fast.  “Sadly, it’s not a cure and comes with a risk of blood clots,” says Roseleila. “He desperately needs the transplant. Every night when I leave him in hospital tohome to my husband and two older children, I become emotional and so does Ethan.” Max and Keira’s Law does not apply to under-s and parents still have to give permission for doctors to use their organs. Before the pandemic, children waited an average  days for a transplant – compared with  for adults. More than  kids in the UK need an organ transplant and  of them are waiting for a heart. The size of the heart is important, meaning a donor of a similar size is needed. A young donor is their only hope. But for some, the call never comes. Amelia Brown has been waiting for a new kidney since she was born eight years ago. She has serious renal problems caused by vacterl syndrome. A transplant is her only hope of enjoying simple childhood joys. Mum Gemma, , of Sheffield, says: “Amelia stays positive by saying things like, ‘When I get a new kidney I’ll be able to jump really high’. “She stays cheerful and positive and that helps me and my husband, Jason. The idea of the transplant never happening is unthinkable. “That’s why we urge families to have the conversation about organ donation.

Research by Loughborough University sheds light on the shameful crisis, with . million children estimated to be in poverty across the UK. The horrying data found the poverty rate has risen fastest in the North East, and where it now affects nearly a quarter of children. Horried MPs in the region have voiced their anger at the government for failing families in their constituencies. Heaviest hit has been Middlesbrough, where more than four in  children are classed as being below the breadline, even before housing costs are taken into account. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror Researchers found .% of kids are affected - a huge increase on the .% in  . Glasgow, Newcastle, Oldham, Bolton, Birmingham and Leeds are among the towns and cities that have seen the steepest rises.Middlesborough MP Andy McDonald told : Sadly I’m not surprised at this report’s findings as this fits with every other measure of deprivation showing Middlesbrough at the wrong end of the table. “Too many families in Middlesbrough are poor because of the impact of failed economic and social policies of Tory Governments since . And he continued: “Austerity has hit places like Middlesbrough hardest. Even the Tories have woken up to the lack of fairness revealed by glaring regional inequalities but its they who have made it increasingly worse ever since they came back into power.And he warned that unless the government properly supports struggling families, it will get a great deal worse. Find out how bad child poverty is in your community by entering your postcode here: Mr McDonald said: It was bad enough before the Covid crisis but the pandemic not only exposes all of that, it will in all likelihood makes things a lot worse. Labour MP Chi Onwurah, who represents Newcastle Central, toldshe is horried, but not surprised at the figures. The analysis shows that the child poverty rate has risen from .% to .% - the third highest increase in Britain. She said: Whataposs horrying is that weaposre the sixth richest nation in the world, and yet this is happening. A signicant proportion of children in poverty have at least one parent in work, so what the last  years of austerity have done is shown that work doesnapost pay anymore.  Ms Onwurah said that the coronavirus pandemic is making the situation even more desperate for struggling families. She said: My casework has gone up hugely since the coronavirus outbreak, there are a lot of people who have lost their jobs, or theyaposre carers for family members and are scared to go out. Weaposve had a huge surge in food bank useage. My concern is that we wonapost now see rises in the jobs that people need, and there wonapost be enough training and support to get them into work.She said many of her constituents have not had a pay rise since , and a five-week wait for Universal Credit is pushing many into poverty. Since  the number of children living in poverty in Britain has risen by , before housing costs are taken into account - meaning one in six children, or %, live in affected homes. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions reveal that . million children were living in poverty in Great Britain in March last year.And the picture is even more bleak after housing costs are taken into account, with the figure rising to . million in the UK under the Tories - , more than a decade ago.North East - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  West Midlands - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  North West - up to % from .% - a .% rise  Yorkshire and Humberside - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  Scotland - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  London - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  South East - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  East of England - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  East Midlands - stayed the same, at .%  Wales - down to .% from .% - a .% decrease  South West - down to .% from % - a .% decrease Campaigners warn that unless the government takes steps to ease the burden on families, the coronavirus pandemic will make the situation even worse.The Daily Mirror is running a Give Me Five campaign - calling on Boris Johnson to urgently address the unfolding tragedy across Britain.We initially called for child benefit to be hiked by £ a week - but our charity partners now say the effect of the pandemic is so bad that the government needs to bring in a £ increase instead. The West Midlands saw child poverty levels rise from .% to .%, while the North West went from .% to %. However the proportion stayed the same in the East Midlands, at .%. And it fell slightly in Wales and the South West, the figures show.  Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Childrenaposs Bureau, who chairs the End Child Poverty group, said: We may all be experiencing the storm of Coronavirus together, but we are not all in the same boat. The government’s data shows the extent to which over the past four years, children in low income families have been cut adrt and are already experiencing unacceptable hardship through cuts and freezes to the benefits system. Our country’s children are now at severe risk of being swept deeper into poverty as a result of the pandemic and lockdown. This is why we are asking the government to strengthen the social security system which is there to hold us steady during tough times, by immediately increasing household income for those least well-off. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, the Daily Mirror was calling on Boris Johnson to hike child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty. Without action the number of kids in poverty in the UK was set to rise from .million to .million in the next two years. Our Give Me Five campaign wanted an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lt , children out of destitution. Our campaign was backed by charities, politicians and union leaders. However, as the global pandemic sparks a fresh recession - which the International Monetary Fund warns could be the worst since the Great Depression in the  - charities say more needs to be done. Action for Children is now calling on the Government to increase child benefit further, by £, to recognise the ever-worsening situation plunging children in poverty. Meanwhile the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is calling for a just emergency intervention, targeted to mitigate the immediate strain on low-income families. The charity says an increase of at least £ per child per week to the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credits would go a long way to covering the increased costs posed by the current and potential subsequent lockdowns. Ending child poverty must be at the heart of the Government’s plan for economic recovery, so that when this crisis is over all children can enjoy a le free from poverty in which they are healthy, can thrive at school and have opportunities for the future. Researchers have warned that as housing costs are not taken into account, the scale of the problem in London - where the cost of living is highest - is not emphasised. But the capital features strongly in figures showing the number of children in poverty evenone adult is in work. In Putney, more than % of children in poverty are in working families, while that figure stands at .% in Tooting. More than two in three children are living in poverty in parts of Birmingham, alongside four in five children in parts of Greater Manchester.  And in London, , children were below the breadline in March . The child poverty figure ranges from just % in Elmbridge, Surrey, to % in places like Oldham in Greater Manchester and Pendle in Lancashire.

But the -year-old recovered from the le-threatening bout of the illness and described his treatment as incredible. Eugenie is likely to have kept her grandmother the Queen informed about her father-in-lawaposs health. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. His illness comes after the Prince of Wales suffered from Covid-, although his symptoms were mild. The princess and the Brooksbank family were said to be relieved after he overcame the virus and the retired chartered accountant and company director said he was making a good recovery. The point I really want to get across is that I think the NHS is absolutely magnicent,apos said Mr Brooksbank, who lives with his we Nicola, , in Wandsworth, south London. The way I was treated was incredible. Nothing was too much trouble and at no point did I get a sense of a shortage of doctors or nurses or any impression that the service was in any way overwhelmed. There was always somebody at hand. I want to offer profound thanks to everyone who was involved. It was a real eye-opener for somebody who has not been in hospital before for anyof time. I certainly owe them my le. Mr Brooksbank, whose son Jack married the Queenaposs grand-daughter in , fell ill in mid-March after a trip to France and ended up being in hospital for nine weeks, said a spokesman for Eugenieaposs mother Sarah, Duchess of York. He was on a ventilator for five weeks at the Cha and Westminster Hospital in London.

He then underwent a further period of rehabilitation at an institution in Roehampton.

Her Majestyaposs net worth in  was said to be £million - but extensive repairs to Buckingham Palace are reported to have taken their toll on her funds, OK reports.The -year-old monarch currently ranks at  on the rich list and is estimated to be worth £million as of this year.It comes after reports royal residences will remain closed to tourists during the  coronavirus crisis and members of staff face pay freezes.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    While The Queen herself is set to withdraw from public duties for months in the longest enforced absence ever during her reign.It was last week confirmed Buckingham Palace would remain shut to visitors for the remainder of the year, while those who have booked to explore the Queenaposs London home will be refunded. While the Royal Collection Trust has also ordered Frogmore House in Windsor and the Prince of Walesaposs London base Clarence House to remain closed in .  Garden parties and investitures at the Palace have already been cancelled, Trooping the Colour will not take place in its normal form and the royals have swapped public appearances for video calls as they carry out their duties while working from home. The Trust, which oversees tourism at royal residences, pays a £ million facility fee to the Royal Household for the privilege of bringing in visitors and a big chunk of it, although not all of it, will be lost. That fee bolsters the £. million the Queen currently receives from the taxpayer under the Sovereign Grant, which is equivalent to  per cent of the Crown Estate profits. The Sun reported Lord Chamberlain Earl Peel - the most senior official of the royal household - has warned staff that income is expected to fall by a third this year leaving reported losses of £.m.In an email to staff seen by the newspaper, the Lord Chamberlain said the royal household was not immune to the impact of the pandemic. All but essential expenditure has been suspended, a recruitment freeze has been implemented and the annual pay review has been paused, he reportedly told staff. A Palace spokesman said the time to address this issue can only come when the impact of the crisis is clearer. At the moment the attention of the royal household is on ensuring it follows all the guidelines and supports the national effort in combatting Covid-, he added.However, it was reported last week Her Majesty had instructed a team of builders to resume work on the £ million refurbishment of Buckingham Palace now that the Government has eased lockdown measures. The Queen has been staying at Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh and is expected to remain there for the foreseeable future.

Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told Sky: I know there are a lot of campsites that are very keen for people to come.  Some of this is being carefully considered, recognising that we have a reduced outdoor transmission risk, that things like camping may well become suitable. But that is a decision that still needs to be taken for later this year, potentially in July or even later in the year, recognising that we need to do all we can to keep that R rate below one, the number of infections down, and we need to be careful when we take those steps.

The company says that prices for these holidays have been adjusted to reflect the experience and guests who already have breaks booked during this period will not be affected at this stage. Gerard Tempest, guest and proposition director, said: “We have thousands of guests who have already had breaks cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  “We look forward to reopening our parks as soon as government advice allows and as soon it is safe to do so, and are busy making changes to the way we operate our parks to ensure we can comply with the latest requirements.

Aya Hachem, a University of Salford student, was an aposinnocent passerbyapos in the alleged drive-by shooting in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Sunday. Three men from Blackburn have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the daylight attack. New footage shows the teen walking on the pavement as a Toyota Avensis appears to slow down ahead of her. She then collapses to the floor, in footagehas chosen not to publish, as the vehicle speeds off down Bank Top. Police say a number of bullets were fired from the vehicle, with one of them hitting Aya. Witnesses claim the shooter was targeting Quick Tyres and Quick Shine Car Wash.  A local resident claimed online: The aim, I believe, was to shoot out the glass in the big main window of the tyre place near Lidl. He missed and shot the lady. A Toyota Avensis with the registration SV UBP was later found abandoned nearby. The Sun has published CCTV of the shooting and also reported that the teen suffered a gunshot wound to the chest.

However,you have diabetes type  or prediabetes, regular exercise is crucial to improve your blood sugar control. Getting fit will also reduce your risk of suffering from further complications such as heart disease and stroke. But you don’t have to become a marathon runner overnight – or indeed start any form of extreme workout. Instead, just increasing your activity levels by a moderate amount can make a huge dference. Always consult your doctor before starting any new exercise plan, especiallyyou have diabetes or any other underlying conditions. How does exercise help with diabetes  When you move about more, your muscles work harder, which means they use up more of their favourite fuel – glucose . Because exercising requires your muscles to burn off excess glucose for energy, it lowers your all-important blood sugar levels. Dr Sarah Brewer says: “Exercise is incredibly important for diabetic patients. It lowers blood sugar and stress levels, which make it helpful in both preventing the disease and controlling it.” How much is enough  People with diabetes type  or prediabetes should get the same recommended  minutes of moderate exercise a week as the rest of us – but should take care not to miss more than two days of exercise in a row to maintain a healthy weight and steady blood sugar. In other words, about  minutes of exercise, five days a week. Aerobic activity at moderate intensity basically means exercising at a level that raises your heart rate and gets you a little bit out of breath. This can include outdoor pursuits such as brisk walking, gentle jogging, bike riding, tennis and golf – all of which are now allowed. Break it up To make the -minute weekly target even more achievable, your daily exercise quota can be broken up into -minute chunks throughout the day, so it’s easier to fit in. With a bit of imagination, most days in lockdown are full of opportunities to get your body moving. Pick and mix from the following activities to help make up your  minutes of exercise, five days a week target. Move to the beat Play your favourite music loud and get moving at home. Dancing is one of the best forms of exercise and is great for losing weight, improving posture, boosting mood and beating stress. Just  minutes of jiving can burn nearly  calories. And the more energetic your moves are the better.  A good clean win Spending so much time at home can mean we have to clean the house more than ever, so why not put in a bit of added elbow grease and make it count as exercise  For example, mopping the floor for  minutes burns  calories, while vigorous vacuuming can burn  calories an hour. The bonus is you’ll be left with a gleaming house! Get the garden sorted Gardening is great exercise that you don’t even realise you’re doing on a nice day outside. Researchers at Kansas State University found it could help strengthen your limbs, boost your heart health and encourage flexibility. And just half an hour of proper digging will burn up to  calories! So get weeding, pruning and mow that early summer lawn. You could even boost your diet and save cash by growing your own veg. Spending time in the garden also has the added bonus of boosting your levels of Vitamin D – the immune-boosting nutrient made by sunlight on skin - which can become deficientwe spend long periods indoors. Workout in your home office It’s amazing how many calories you can burn while sat down – just by moving your limbs a bit more. If you’re at a home desk, try marching your feet up and down on the spot for a few minutes – this will work the large muscles in your legs. For easy calf exercises, simply raise your feet up on the toes and lower them. And to tone your tummy, sit up straight and pull your stomach muscles in towards your spine. Keep breathing normally and hold this position for  seconds. Count your steps Hit the well-known , steps a day target for a full week and you will have done roughly the same level of activity as the recommended  weekly minutes of exercise. However, even with the more relaxed lockdown, we’re all typically walking less at the moment. Soyou have a pedometer, a fitness tracker or even an iPhone, which all have built-in activity monitors, carry it at all times to check you’re achieving the target number of steps each day. A few steps short today  Use the extra daylight to head outside for a brisk evening walk. Lt some beans You can exercise without any equipment at all – saving the cost of buying expensive gym kit. For example, why not use a couple of cans of baked beans to strengthen your arms  Simply hold your “weights” down by your sides with your palms facing forwards. Then, without moving the upper part of your arms, slowly bend your arm at the elbow, bringing the cans up to your shoulders. Return to the starting position, keeping each movement slow. Repeat - times per arm.

Using the working name Sweet Arches, the -year-old is funding her studies with her unusual sideline job, but warns itaposs far from an easy way to make a quick buck. Admitting to having a food fetish herself, Sweet gets up to  messages a day with unusual photo requests. She said: “Some people like the soles of the feet, some like the toes, some like to see them in dferent positions. “People like to watch me crush things, like raspberries, grapes or cakes with my toes. I’ve actually had someone ask me to squish ants, but that’s a no no for me. Anything that’s living, I won’t do that! “The strangest request was from someone asking me to run him over in my car! I said absolutely not. That’s definitely the craziest thing I’ve refused to do. Working in a hospital, I thought that would be quite counter-productive! “Some fans like ‘self-foot worship,’ where I play with my feet on camera. Others ask me to suck, kiss or lick my toes, or ask for me to send them worn boots or shoes. “One client asked for a pair of my boots. A lot of people with a foot fetish like the stinky smell, but it’s super hard for me to get my feet to stink. The client was still happy though, even though they smelled like my coconut foot mask!  Sweet, who lives in Portland in Oregon, US, also works in a hospital theatre, but earns a lot more with her foot work - often up to £, a year. “After one month of doing this, I tripled my hospital income as a surgical assistant - which is ,before tax. It’s insane. “Having a foot fetish myself, I started doing it for fun a year ago, just to share pictures of my cute feet. I didn’t think I could make a living from it.” Sweet Arches says she has been fascinated by her own and other peopleaposs feet since childhood.  “I have always had a foot fetish, enjoying pedicures and making sure my feet look good,” she recalled. “Even when I was very young, Iaposd always compliment people on their feet or randomly give foot massages to my friends, whereas most people think feet are weird. They would call me gross. “Then, about two years ago, a friend showed me that there was a whole community of others like me online, so I ed right in. I was so happy to find like-minded people.“I set up my own page on Instagram in May  and started posting pictures and videos every day. I had no idea what I was doing, but looked at other sites for inspiration, then a few bigger pages gave me a shout out, so my followers went up.“Now I have , followers on Instagram and , on Twitter.”Sweet now also has an OnlyFans account - a website which allows users to pay a subscription for exclusive content. “I direct everybody to my OnlyFans site, so they can request videos or pictures,” she said. “I’m still on a learning curve with it all. Some girls will offer pornographic videos or pictures, but I do not do that. “There’s all kinds of dferent stuff and you can make it your own.” As well as fans paying monthly subscriptions and buying inidual videos or custom content, Sweet Arches receives tips in the form of gts and recently enjoyed a day out at a spa.  She keeps custom videos to a minimum, so she has time to keep on top of requests and messages. She said: “I now have almost , subscribers on Only Fans, and usually get  to  messages or requests a day, so it is a lot to get through -  although I have a friend who used to be a porn star, who gets more than ,. “Mine are mostly to do with feet, but there are requests for other pictures. “I never get fully naked. I do respond to some risqué requests, but Iaposm cautious. “Everybody is super respectful, though. Eventhey are asking me for something and I tell them I’m not willing to do it, they are still really polite. “But I do get sent, shall we say, pictures of male anatomy. That is a hazard of the job!” Keeping her fans happy means Sweet Arches ensuring that her feet are always in tip top condition.  “I do my own pedicures and manicures twice a month, she said. Often I will go for natural or nude nail colours, but I will also take requests from people. “I love a foot mask, too, and have a double-sided pumice stone in the shower that I use every day. “I thinksomeone takes care of their feet, the rest of their body will look good. Feet and hands are so overlooked, even though research shows that feet are as sensory as the bodyaposs more intimate areas.Now Sweet Arches - who says her friends and family fully support what she does - admits that, since starting her OnlyFans site, she has also developed a hand fetish and says her work has helped her to feel empowered. She said: “I feel in control of my body and I can say yes or no to requests. I’m so passionate about it and have so much respect for the foot fetish community.” But she does receive some negative messages about her fetish work. “Most of the messages I get are really nice, but I will get the odd vomit emoji, she said. The most negative thing I’ve heard is that I’m fat or a chubby girl – and that doesn’t bother me at all. “I’m so thankful that I’ve been able to make an income from this and that I can pay for my studies. My ultimate goal is to be able to help my mum to retire. She is in remission from cancer and has been continuing to work as an auditor and quality line leader through her recovery. She is a power house and Iaposd love to be able to help her.” But, with unemployment rising due to the Covid- pandemic, Sweet Arches is cautioning against people thinking that selling pictures of their feet is a quick way to make money. “It takes time and commitment to get to where I am now and you do have to have aesthetically pleasing feet, like I do,” she said.

Jilin, home to around . million, has sealed off one of its districts this week after changing the areaaposs emergency level to aposhigh-riskapos. Today, the city reported a total of  new infections, and  in Shulan, which has a population of ,. The  new cases are believed to be linked to the same source, as officials investigate how the first person caught Covid-. According to Chinese media six officials from both cities have been removed from their pots following the new cluster of cases. New measures in the province of Jilin have seen trains and buses have been cut off, schools shut, and thousands being put into strict lockdown. Chinese people in the area have expressed their frustration at the new measures which have quashed hopes that le could soonto normal. “Everyone is jittery,” said Wang Yuemei, a pharmaceutical factory worker in neighboring Tonghua, told  Bloomberg News.“I never ever expected Jilin province to be a hard-hit area when the whole country is getting back to normal now.” Shulan went into lockdown last week quarantined some , people in a failed bid to contain the second outbreak. Fengman District has recorded  cases of local infection in the same period and was put on lockdown on Monday after a -point directive from the local health commission. The travel restrictions include bans on all outbound foot and vehicle traffic, as well as the closure of schools and entertainment venues such as cinemas, gyms and restaurants. Residential districts have been put on closed management, with each household allowed to send one member to shop for essentials once a day. All shops and the majority of supermarkets in the districts also shut on Monday, reports added, while city officials were also gathering testing kits and protective equipment for health workers. Images show shutter doors closed and streets barricaded and nearing empty as the restrictions came into place at the weekend.  Following an order on May , the Jilin Ice Sports Center was converted into a field hospital in  hours and is now ready to accept patients. It was still unclear which category of patients would be sent to the winter sports arena. Last week, footage also showed secondary school pupils being sent home as case numbers grew. Classes had only just resumed on April  after much of China declared victory of the coronavirus outbreak. It comes as the city of Wuhan ordered all  million residents to be tested for coronavirus.  Dubbed the ‘-day battle’, the Chinese city officials launched a campaign on Thursday, May , after the Wuhan Health Commission announced a cluster of six new infections - the first since the city ended its two-month lockdown on Wednesday, April . Authorities have said the ambitious plan may be the only way to identy all asymptomatic carriers in the city, where residents remain wary and concerned about a second wave of infections.

She had to take part in a training scheme at a Stockholm university before taking up the role and cutting back on her royal duties so she can help the very sickest in hospital. The princess shared a photo of her wearing full scrubs on social media and has been widely praised for stepping up to help during the coronavirus pandemic. The snap shows her name badge, which simply says aposSofiaapos. A statement from the Swedish Royal Family said: In the crisis we find ourselves in, the Princess wants to get involved and make a contribution as a voluntary worker to relieve the large workload of health care professionals. Her role means she will be cleaning, helping with patient care and assisting in the kitchens. The -year-old joined Swedenaposs royal family in  and she and her husband, Prince Carl Philip, have two children - but Princess Sofia is used to le in the limelight. Now a well-respected member of the royal family, Princess Sofia first found fame as a model when she was just . And when she and Prince Carl Philip began dating, eyebrows were certainly raised in royal circles over her past. Princess Sofia started her career in front of the camera as a glamour model, posing for Swedish lads mag, Slitz, in camouflage knickers with a snake draped around her shoulders - and not a lot . At the time the young model said she had taken the job to help her pay for college. But she was extremely popular with Slitz readers and in  was crowned Miss Slitz. From modelling it was only a small step into the world of reality TV. Princess Sofia starred in the show Paradise Hotel. It saw a group of beautul single people moved into a lavish hotel to see what happened. While she was a contestant on the show, the now royal was given a massage, with her topless, from a man also taking part. Her new found fame opened all sorts of doors for the young model and she travelled to Los Angeles, where she met porn str Jenna Jameson. Princess Sofia later told the magazine that had propelled her into the spotlight, Slitz, that she and Jenna had kissed. She added: We ended up at the same party as Jenna. She came up saying that I was one of the cutest girls she had seen and wanted me to come and sit with them. And it seemed like le on the other side of the Atlantic agreed with the budding model and TV star, who relocated to New York. Here, she lived with her best friend and seemed to throw herself into the party lestyle. Princess Sofia and her pal are said to be the authors of a secret blog, where they detailed all their exploits with the rich and famous, including Puff Daddy and Hollywood A-listers like Mark Wahlberg. One entry said: To be a woman in NY is an advantage. Don’t take this the wrong way, but here the men aim to please. But it was on a visit back to Sweden that Princess Sofiaaposs le was to change forever.  She was on a night out in her native Stockholm with her friends when she was introduced to Prince Carl Philip - and the rest seems to be fate. Less than  months later the couple were living together and the princess-in-waiting had ditched her old le.

The monster storm was churning through the Bay of Bengal and was due to make landfall on Wednesday afternoon local time in a region that is home to millions of vulnerable residents in low-lying flood-prone coastal areas and the worldaposs largest refugee camp. Officials said Amphan could wash away thousands of fragile huts or shelters and destroy crops as it batters parts of India and Bangladesh with mph winds equivalent to a category  hurricane, heavy rain, huge waves and a storm surge as high as a two-storey house. Are you in the path of Super Cyclone Amphan  Email webnews@mirror. The stormaposs cloud field is , miles long from tip to tail - that’s the equivalent of the distance from Lisbon to Warsaw, CNN reported. CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said: A storm of this magnitude with the amount of rainfall and the storm surge on the coast could be catastrophic across this region of India and Bangladesh. Heavy rain and strong winds began lashing two eastern Indian states and parts of Bangladesh hours before the powerful cyclone was due to make landfall. As many as  million people could be exposed to tropical cyclone winds during the cyclone, the Pacic Disaster Center said.Rescue teams were evacuating millions of villagers to higher ground in an operation complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.Bangladeshaposs disaster management officials said they were working on a war footing to evacuate about two million people from coastal areas as Cyclone Amphan approached from the Bay of Bengal. Oxfam fears up . million people may be displaced and , homes could be destroyed. More than  Rohingya refugees living on flood-prone Bhasan Char island in the Bay of Bengal were moved to storm shelters. The members of the persecuted minority from Myanmar were sent to the island this month after being rescued from boats. The United Nations has called for the refugees to be moved to the mainland to join more than a million more who live in sprawling camps in the worldaposs largest refugee camp outside the town of Coxaposs Bazar.Although that settlement, the worldaposs largest refugee camp, is expected to escape the worst of the storm, the danger level has been raised to nine from six, signying a severe threat.The weather department in India said Amphan was likely to  weaken into an extreme severe cyclonic storm and cross the coast near West Bengal state or Bangladesh.It predicted a storm surge of up to ft that threatens to submerge many homes and farm land.Disaster management official SG Rau said: The cyclone could wash away thousands of huts and standing crops. An Indian federal home ministry official said West Bengal and neighbouring Odisha state were struggling to house thousands of evacuees as existing shelters were being used as coronavirus quarantine centres. Extra shelters were being prepared in wholesale markets and government buildings with allowances made for social distancing, while masks and scarves were being distributed among the villagers.  Police in West Bengal state, which is expected to be badly affected by the storm, said people were unwilling to go to the shelters because they were afraid of contracting Covid- and many were refusing to leave their livestock behind. A senior police official in Kolkata told Reuters: We have literally had to force people out of their homes, make them wear masks and put them in government buildings. Railway officials have erted trains away from the cycloneaposs path to protect thousands of migrant workers travelling to eastern states from the capital New Delhi where they had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus lockdown. Pankaj Anand, of the humanitarian group Oxfam in India, described Amphan as a crisis on top of a crisis, Al Jazeera reported. He said: Many of the cyclone evacuation shelters are already being used as coronavirus quarantine centres or housing migrants who have ed to their coastal communities because of lockdown. People are worried there wonapost be enough space in the shelters and that they might catch coronavirus in them.  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/5a325b709485a.jpg ","title":"almost 3400 people in dundee sign on for universal credit during coronavirus pandemic","story":"The number of Dundonians claiming Universal Credit rose by a whopping % in the first month of the coronavirus pandemic.Statistics published by the Office for National Statistics, sourced from the Department for Work and Pensions, show , people registered for the benefit between March  and April .It is a huge increase on the period running from February to March, when  people signed on, and includes both jobseekers and those who claim Universal Credit but are unable to work.However, the vast majority of the new claimants are either required to look for work or are preparing to start a job.After moves to other JobCentres are taken into account, the total number of claimants on file at the Dundee JobCentre stands at ,, up , from , the previous month.Jane McEwen, service manager at Dundee#s JobCentre Plus, says she and her team are coping well with the additional demand and are doing their best to support those out of work.#There#s been a record increase in the volume of people making claims to Universal Credit, and we have focused on making sure people get paid their money,# she said.#We#ve closed the doors here but we#re phoning people and have a new callback system so we don#t have customers sitting on phones for hours on end waiting to get through, which has been very positive.#We#re hitting % payment accuracy so there aren#t issues down the line, and we#re now looking at contacting them to do customer care, giving them information about how to manage themselves.#Analysis conducted by research unit, Centre for Cities also showed that the City of Discovery had the second highest percentage change in Scotland relating to the number of new people claiming unemployment benefit # with only Glasgow registering a higher percentage change from the month of March.Despite the majority of employers in sectors such as leisure and hospitality closing their doors during the pandemic, Ms McEwen says opportunities are still out there for those who want to work.She added: #It#s quite surreal in the office # we normally have banks of desks together but we can#t do that at the moment due to social distancing.

Stop-start season but nothing but good things to say about the club. Looking forward to the next chapter.”Salford later confirmed Conway – whose Scottish Cup Final double for United against Ross County was ten years ago on Friday – was among  stars released by the Greater Manchester outfit managed by former Scotland full-back Graham Alexander.They said: “We would like to thank each and every player for their considerable efforts on behalf of the club and extend our sincere best wishes for the future.”Conway, , played  games for Salford in   after joining in October following five-and-a-half years at Blackburn Rovers.The winger, capped seven times for the national team, left the Tangerines for Cardf a year after his Hampden heroics.Last week he said: “It is so hard to put into words exactly how you felt but there was a massive sense of achievement.“The  years have just flown by but there will always be a special bond with the lads.“It was one of the best days of my career and my medal still has pride of place in a room in my house.”Letheren, meanwhile, signed for City on a one-year deal last summer, making  appearances after two League One campaigns with Plymouth Argyle.The -year-old joined Dundee in  from Kilmarnock, where he had been on the bench for their League Cup triumph a year earlier against Celtic at Hampden.He came tantalisingly close to realising his dream of playing for Wales during his time in the City of Discovery after being called up by Chris Coleman for a Euro  qualying clash with Andorra.The goalkeeper – who has also starred for the likes of Swansea, Blackpool, York and Barnsley – endeared himself to the Dens faithful with his match-winning save late on in the dramatic win against Dumbarton that sealed a Premiershipsix years ago.Former Manchester United and Everton midfielder Darron Gibson, , is also one of those looking for a new team after playing just four times for Salford during their maiden Football League season.Craig Conway reveals the film he watched with Jon Daly the night before United#s  Scottish Cup triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp craig-conway-film-jon-daly-dundee-united-scottish-cup embed # secretDwWuDfxX\" data-secret\"DwWuDfxX\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e218883aa2074.61826575-909x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united ian harkes grandfather coronavirus","story":"He could hardly have been further away, but the coronavirus pandemic hit close to home for Dundee United midfielder Ian Harkes.His grandfather, Ron Kunihiro, had been fighting Covid- since early March with Harkes stuck in Dundee unable to catch a flight back to America.Thankfully, now at their family home in Virginia and by his side, Harkes has witnessed the -year-old recover.“I was just happy to get home. My granddad got out of the hospital and he’s been battling Covid,” the -year-old said.“He’s had it for a while. It’s been a long process which started back in the beginning of March when he first started to feel ill.“He went in to the hospital for  days or so. I was still in Dundee so we had to FaceTime or Zoom call the family to keep updated on everything.“Thankfully, we were able to find some flights and get back over.“He’s healthy now which is great. It’s been great to see him recover and nice to be here with the family.“The challenge now is getting back over to Scotland but, thankfully, I’ve got a UK passport so I should be OK!”Harkes travelled back to the states with fiancée and Celtic Women’s player Sarah Teegarden a few weeks back.Their wedding plans are on hold and the country is in disarray but Harkes insists it’s nice to spend precious time with his loved ones.He continued: “She was able to come back as well which is good.“It’s nice to spend time together but all our wedding plans will be pushed back now.“On the mental side being back with them all helps tremendously, missing them throughout the year.“They came over around Christmas time but seeing them again six months later has been big. It always gives me a lt.“It’s a bit dferent here than the UK. Some things don’t seem so shut down but that’s just America right now – we’re not quite sure what’s going on.“It’s quite crazy just now with the amount of cases and, unfortunately, the amount of deaths we’ve had in America.“I think the country’s a little bit all over the place, some places are opening up and some are closed, but right now we’re still in lockdown in Virginia.“All the states are dferent but it’s been OK here.“I’m not sure how long that will be but we need to be safe, especially with having that experience in my family.“I think we’ve all had a little bit of a dferent view towards it but we’ll see how it goes and hope for the best.“We can still exercise and things like that. I’ve had space to go and run and cycle, do some things in the yard and touch a ball every day.“It’s been good to have certain resources back home and to keep doing stuff.”Like most, lockdown has been a test for Harkes’ mentally and physically. For him, it’s a challenge he soon hopes to rise to on the pitch.Harkes added: “It’s definitely been a challenge on both sides but, thankfully, the club provided us with a great fitness programme before we went on furlough to keep us ticking over.“I’ve been active and all of us want to be flying when we finally get the go-ahead to get back to playing.“We’re all trying to push each other and push ourselves.“On the mental side, the way we ended was a little tough because we wanted to play for the fans and finish out the season.“We really felt like we deserved the title and we knew it then but we just wanted to finish off the games and prove it to everyone.“We’ll have that desire to get back on the pitch and play hard when we finally get it going.”The United support have taken to Harkes since he joined the club in January last year, as much for his flowing locks as his skill on the pitch.He is pleased to inform them nothing has changed on the hair front in lockdown but that he might soon be forced to take matters into his own hands.“I’m still going strong but it will be cut before everything gets going again,” Harkes said.“I think it’s getting a bit ridiculous now.“I don’t want to start putting it up in a bun and everything.

However, I’m getting the sneaking feeling now just isn’t the right time.That might come as a surprise to people who have read this column over the past few weeks andIt seems like we are slowly moving toward the game eventually restarting.Yesterday’s announcement of the Premiership being called with Celtic champions and Hearts relegated came as no surprise.There was no other credible option.The Jambos will, obviously, feel aggrieved and so will some Rangers fans but it is the right call.I said from the start of the shutdown that reconstruction is the only way to ensure no club is unduly affected by leagues ending early.And I still stand by that.However, the situation we are in now a couple of months down the line leads me to pause for thought.Clubs are in such dire straits right now, nobody really knows how many might go to the wall before the game restarts.If we’ve already agreed reconstruction and, say, five clubs go under, we have to start the whole process over again.The decision-makers in the game have shown over the past few farcical weeks that there’s a realI can see where the Premiership clubs were coming from when they canned the revamp talks  days ago.It looks like a mammoth job to get football back on the pitch sometime soon, eventhe SPFL are planning to restart again in July.With that in mind, I’d prefer reconstruction talks were put on the back burner – not binned, by any means – and talked about in a measured fashion over the next few months.Start the new season as normal – eventhings have to wait a few weeks to get the green light – and then get a plan in place for the season after.That way, the new set-up comes from a foundation of stability rather than the uncertainty the game is surrounded by right now and what the future might hold.At the very least, clubs can now plan for the season ahead, knowing who they will be facing eventhere are still doubts around.The big thing for all clubs is getting that stability back, that certainty to then plan ahead.It feels like that’s coming – once it’s back, start talking reconstruction to improve our game in the long-term.I felt for a couple of my old team-mates who were released by their clubs over the weekend.The coronavirus pandemic is obviously a dficult time for everybody but being without a job through it is horrible.Particularly when there’s no prospect right now of finding another employer.With football clubs unable to make moves in the transfer market because of the shutdown, that leaves players like Danny Swanson and Craig Conway in limbo.Normally, I’d expect them to have plenty of offers to think over this summer.Swansonis one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen in training.He was superb at Tannadice.He obviously hasn’t played so much at St Johnstone for whatever reason, leading to his departure.Conway, meanwhile, has had a really successful career since leaving United.He was always such a fit guy and a great lad to have in the dressing-room, he’d normally find a new club no problem.Right now, though, nobody knows what will happen.I was pleased to see Dundee say they were extending some contracts.Christie Elliott’s for another year, a clause he had in his deal, and Paul McGowan, Josh Meekings and Tom Field till July. Even though that’s just a few weeks, it sends the right message – that they are going to look after players.I don’t imagine every club will be doing that.A lot of players will have a stressful summer coming up with no club able to sign them.Theof football with the Bundesliga starting at the weekend was very much a step in the right direction for me.It might have been a bit strange without the crowds but needs must.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved. A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years. Now, with enterprise, hard work and co-operation, it seems like it is a distinct possibility.A pat on the back to all the volunteer stitchers # #sewers# doesn#t look quite right written down # out there working hard to provide protective equipment and clothing for health workers.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin.

virus, andthe findings of the weekly National Records of Scotlandreport.Until then, the Scottish Government advice remains the same: stay at home.What lockdown measurescould we expect to be eased SportsIts no secret that many Scots have been longing toto some outdoor leisure activities.Its thought that officials are considering whether sports like golf, tennis and fishing couldafter the next

Scotland has taken a more relaxed approach from England and Wales.Currently, south of the border, garden centres have reopened, with Tory MSP Rachael Hamilton dubbing the decision not to open them as \"completely illogical\".Recycling centresThe issue of recycling centres has been a hot topic for many local areas across the country.Lockdown measures have seen a rise in fly-tipping across the country.Yesterday, COSLA revealed household waste and recycling centres could be open by June  following a meeting of all council leaders.Meeting other householdsCurrently in Scotland, we are only allowed to be with people from our own household.Last week, Boris Johnson announced that in England, twopeople from two households will be able to meet in a public place, providing they maintain a two-metre distance.And groups of up to six people from two dferent households are now permitted to meet-up outside in Northern Ireland,they stick to social distancing.It is hoped that measures, potentially in line with that of England, could come into place here.Steps back to normalityThe First Minister said at the briefing: ldquoWithin two weeks, my hope is that we will be taking some concrete steps on the journey back to normality.ldquoAs Irsquove said before, it wonrsquot be normality as we knew it because the virus will not have gone away, but it will be a journey to a better balance ndash I hope ndash than the one we have today.ldquoAs we take each step, we must make sure that the ground beneath us is as solid as possible.ldquoThatrsquos why sticking with the lockdown restrictions a bit longer to suppress the virus more is so important, because that will mean we can start to take these steps with the confidence that we have alternative means of effectively keeping it under control."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-sets-plans-get-people-scotland-back-work-latest-cases-revealed","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has revealed Scottish Government plans to help people

app.The issues have been flagged to the National Cyber Security Centre , which is involved in the apprsquos development, and it said it is in the process of fixing them.The researchers also warned legal protections around data use are needed in order to better protect personal privacy on the app, which is currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight.They say data associated with the app should be protected by legislation ldquofrom use by law enforcement, or any usage not directly related to Covid- prevention.Harriet Harman, chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said on Tuesday that new laws to protect the privacy of personal information gathered by the app are a ldquono brainer.Ms Harman, who has prepared a Bill on the issue which is ready for introduction, said assurances by Health Secretary Matt Hancock do not provide any protection after he wrote to her saying the Government believes legislation is unnecessary because there is already the Data Protection Act.In their study of the contact tracing app, which was shared with the NCSC last week, security researchers Professor Vanessa Teague and Dr Chris Culnane identied a number of issues, including a weakness in the apprsquos registration process which could be exploited by hackers and used to manipulate data or create logs of fake contact events.vw,vw,px, px\"It also highlighted a flaw which means storing unencrypted data on a userrsquos phone could potentially be used by law enforcement agencies to determine when two or more people met.The research added that generating new random ID codes for users

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity. What is yours Already safety rules for the bug are being set by my children. Number one rule: dad must never sit on it, but he can pull it.The term rod for my own back comes to mind."},{"url":null,"title":"tourism-impacted-covid-19-lockdown-says-mp","story":"LAST weekendrsquos Bank Holiday would normally have seen East Lothianrsquos beaches crowded and towns and countryside thronged with visitors.

The test looks for antibodies which could help indicate whether a person has developed some immunity against the virus.As it is able to detect  per cent of cases where a person has had coronavirus in the past, the test could prove useful in helping to inform when lockdown restrictions may be safe to ease.The Department of Health and Social Caresaid it is exploring the use of antibody testing across the NHS in England, and later the wider public.DHSC said it was delighted that devices were progressing through validation and is working on plans to roll out antibody testing, adding that an announcement will be made ldquoin due course.Health officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions about testing, but are likely to roll out the antibody testEngland adopts it."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-testing-site-operating-former-power-station","story":"Army personnel can be seen carrying out tests while wearing masks as they welcome key workers and family members who received appointments to attend.The mobile unit is using the former Cockenzie Power Station site as one of several bases across Scotland which it will visit as additional testing is carried out by the UK Government.It opened yesterday with a \"Covid Testing\" sign at the entrance to the site.Imagesshow a team of military staff on the site carrying out testing through vehicle windows at the drive through centre.The st Infantry Brigade, which oversees army reserves in Scotland, are running the mobile unit.The mobile units are providing additional testing capacity to the NHS which continues to focus on testing hospital and social care workers.It is hoped the mobile units will be able to offer tests to other key workers and their families from a wider range of identied essential services including those working in the third sector and volunteer care helpers.The unit willto Cockenzie in two weeks time as part of the national testing programme"},{"url":null,"title":"leuchie-house-toasts-superb-inspection-results","story":"Following an unannounced inspection in January, the Care Inspectorate awarded Leuchie House the highest possible score in four categories and the second highest in a fth.The categories were: quality of care and support quality of staffing quality of leadership how well peoplersquos wellbeing is supported and quality of setting.The report said: ldquoGuests experienced respectful and compassionate care at each stage of their interaction with the service.

would require . spaces for small homes and up to . spaces for larger ones.Mr Williamson told council officers: \"Lots of people whether in affordable homes or private homes have more than one car why are we allowing just  per cent parking spaces \"And he pointed to new housing in his Musselburgh ward where he said a similar decision had been taken and cars were nowparked \"all over the

the lower car ownership.\"A planning officer added: \"We are able to reduce parking with housing association and affordable housing. We have used this approach many times in affordable housing schemes.\"The committee approved the plans lodged by Springfield Properties as part of the affordable phase of a larger development at Windygoul South where it is expected around  homes will be built.Members were told the  new properties housing would be taken on by the council once built.They will be builtin the north eastern part of the wider Windygoul South site, in an area bounded to the west by woodland and existing housingon George Grieve Way.Councillor Colin McGinn, ward member for Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry, welcomed the addition of affordable housing but raised concerns about the impact of additional traffic on the town centre.He called for the council to look at bringing forward proposals for a Tranent bypass, which has been discussed in the past.Mr McGinn said: \"I believe now is the time to look at the bypass.\""},{"url":null,"title":"british-gas-customers-can-get-five-days-electricity-free","story":"Who is eligible for the offer The offer is only available to those who are part of the British Gas loyalty scheme, which is available to all energy customers.Launched in , the scheme provides customers with ious discounts on restaurants and days out, along with prize draws for live entertainment and holidays.Customers can receive up to  free energy days per year through the loyalty scheme, with the amount depending on how long they have been with the supplier.At the moment, British Gas is offering five extra days completely free, as customers are spending more time at home due to coronavirus, and increasing their energy usage as a result. However, customers cannot choose which five days to get free themselves.Instead, British Gas will take an average daily price for your energy usage per month and deduct that amount from your next bill.The value of the free electricity is dependent on an inidual customersrsquo average consumption and tarf prices.According to government figures, the average monthly electricity bill cost almost pound per month in , meaning customers would save roughly pound by claiming the offer from British Gas.But the freebie will come as a welcome reprieve for many, with energy bills having climbed by pound per month during the UK lockdown.How do I claim it To claim the five free energy days, you need to sign up to British Gas Rewards.This can be done via the British Gas website, or through your online account.Once you have signed up, simply select the list of available offers and claim the free energy days.If you are already a rewards user, be sure to claim the offer before it expires on May .Should I still be working from home If your electricity bill has been climbing due to working from home, you will still have to deal with the added expense for a while longer.Despite lockdown restrictions slowly starting to ease in some parts of the UK, the government has advised workers to continue working from home wherever possible.This is to help minimise the number of social contacts across the country, thereby keeping transmissions as low as possible.Workers in England who are unable to work from home can now travel to work,their workplace is open.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

She pays in cash, he puts it in the till and thanks her.There follows an awkward silence.ldquoWell  she says.ldquoWell what ldquoCan I have it ldquoHave what ldquoThe thing I just bought.ldquoOh that  No.ldquoIrsquom sorry ldquoNo, you canrsquot have it.ldquoBut Irsquove just paid for it.ldquoI know.ldquoSo whatrsquos the problem ldquoWell unfortunately, he sighs sadly, ldquoour policy has changed.ldquoSince when ldquoSince just after I put your money in the till.ldquoWell. Can I have my money back then He frowns sympathetically, but shakes his head.ldquoWhy not ldquoPolicy, he shrugs, and beckons the next customer forward.Now admittedly Irsquove never been very good at telling jokes, butyoursquore not splitting your sides right now that may be because this story currently feels a bit too real.Because this scenario is essentially whatrsquos happening to people all over the country at the moment as some airline companies, event planners and other suppliers refuse to refund people after a cancellation.Recent hits on the refund pages of our Advice for Scotland website have risen by  per cent, suggesting that the problem is not just a few isolated incidents. Yesterday, with their consent, we published the stories of some of those affected. These cases were shocking, but not un-typical of the broader numbers we are seeing: people who have shelled out thousands of pounds and are struggling to get it back.In many cases these are people who have scrimped and saved or dipped into their savings for the holiday of a letime, or their dream wedding, only to see that dream crumble in cancellation ndash and then find that they have to fight to get refunded. Many have told us of the misery of spending hour after hour, day after day on the phone, bouncing between endless muzak, recorded messages and inflexible agents. Instead of cash, some companies are urging devastated customers to take a voucher: a voucher with a deadline.Of course some say that the companies concerned didnrsquot cause the pandemic and they should therefore be able to keep the money.Otherwise, it is argued, they may have to lose staff or they may even go bust. While we sympathise with any business that is adversely affected by the current crisis, wersquod point out that their customers didnrsquot cause the pandemic either, and many of them too are struggling with reduced incomes, furloughs and redundancy.Moreover, the Government has provided employers with means of retaining their workers and staving off the receiver. Inidual consumers cannot be expected to subsidise business by effectively giving an un-willing donation to companies who have let them down.Itrsquos important not to over-complicate this. The most basic consumer principle of all is that when you pay for something, you should get that thing, in good order, andyou donrsquot you are entitled to your money back. When these peoplesrsquo flight wedding holiday was not provided, they should be refunded. And yet it seems many are facing a brick wall.So whatrsquos to be done  Well, this is the kind of situation where it pays to have a strong consumer protection landscape like the one Scotland and the UK have built in recent years.The establishment of Consumer Scotland, following the Holyrood vote earlier this month, is just the latest iteration of the idea that consumers have power, and that they should be both enabled and encouraged to stand up for their rights.But this trend of refund refusals will be a good test of whether our consumer landscape is actually fit for purpose. In other words, is it a real safety net for consumers, or just a source of warm words and good intentions We at CAS are doing our bit by offering advice and support to those affected, and by raising public awareness of the problem. What must happen now is that the regulators ndash those who have actual powers to clamp down on bad practice and force rogue companies to do the right thing ndash must act. The law is clear. If businesses wonrsquot follow it and provide proper refunds, they should be compelled to do so, or penalised.The alternative is that we all just abandon the most basic consumer right of all, and accept that you can pay for something, not get it and never see your money again.Now that would be a joke.

I am ashamed that any Scottish public health official should try to justy what happened with regard to the Nike conference in Edinburgh , but the responsibility for this failure of public duty lies squarely at the top.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.THE lting of the Scottish lockdown depends on an effective track and trace mechanism. The events at the Edinburgh Nike conference at the end of February do not instil confidence in this system.Despite Nicola Sturgeons dismissal of the notion of a \"cover-up\" as political, it was certainly ineffective. Since the revelations by the BBC, a number of potential,not actual, victims from this original source have emerged. Track and trace never found them.There are still many questions to be answered over the handling of this and these answers must come urgently before lockdown is lted with track and trace as its replacement. Transparency is needed now from the ScottishGovernment, but it might have to include admitting to having made specic mistakes right from the start.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.THE incoming Royal Society president, the distinguished statistician Sir Adrian Smith, asked that political leaders such as Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon who are forever saying ldquowe are simply doing what scientists tell us should stop passing the buck and be more open about the advice they receive.A major failing of the coronavirus strategy north and south of the Border was how much decision-making went on in secret. He said: ldquoOpenness and transparency are essential. Its absurd the membership of Sage was only recently released and that the full minutes of its meetings are still a state secret.\"There was no rigorous assessment of the radically dferent approaches of other nations like Sweden and lack of transparency opened both governments to accusations they were part of the Oxford University-Imperial College epidemiological turf war which led to horses being changed in mid-stream.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.I NOTE that Neil Gaiman made his ,-mile trip from New Zealand via Los Angeles and London more than two weeks ago .I wonder , while sheltering in Skye, he has noticed the mysterious case of infections and  deaths in a Skye care home over the past two weeks and wondersit could be the result of people like him who seem to think stay at home and do not travel does not apply to them.My mother in law stays four miles away as the crow flies and my parents  miles from me.

HIAL#s modernisation plans would see air traffic control operations at a five airports, including Kirkwall Airport, centralised to a control centre in Inverness, using remote tower technology.Speaking last week, councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of OIC#s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said:“We need to fully understand the impact on our community before any decision is made to create a remote air traffic control centre in Inverness.”“So it is disappointing that the government and HIAL have disregarded a call by this council, and others, for them to undertake an Islands Impact Assessment before by moving ahead with their plans.“We asked for this earlier in the year and expected the assessment to be completed before HIAL began to undertake a procurement process.”Councillor Sinclair added: “An immense amount of work was undertaken before the passing of the IslandsAct to ensure that Islands Impact Assessments would be carried out to give communities like ours a say when major changes such as this are proposed.“This appears to have been ignored on this occasion, which is why we are asking for the process to be paused until an assessment is undertaken.”HIAL#s position is that impact assessment is being carried out. Spokesman said: “An island impact assessment is currently underway and is being undertaken by an independent consultant. This will include consultation with local authorities and community groups. It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme. This technology will help deliver sustainable aviation connectivity and deliver a flexible, resilient air traffic service that will be highly adaptable as we ensure our airports are fit for the future.“The procurement process for such tenders is a y process We anticipate that the process to procure the remote tower technology solution will be completed by December  January .“We have reviewed our capital programme to allow us to implement key projects, and have other projects shelf-ready for when we are able toto some semblance of normality. We are also prioritising projects that will deliver local economic benefit within our communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

a new and continuous cough or a high temperature # are being reminded to isolate themselves for seven days.Anyone  in a household where someone has symptoms should still isolate for  days.England says thank you, Boris. #You can now sunbath!#. Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe.

Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: .."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK. It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

Nam measg, bha Niall Mòr nam Breac.Fhuair Niall a fhrith-ainm leis gun robh e fìor mhath mar iasgair-slait. Bha e a’ leantainn air feadhainn eile san teaghlach aige. Rinn fear dhiubh rudeigin math airson rìgh air choreigin. Dh’fhaighnich an rìgh gu dè an duais a bha e ag iarraidh. ‘Tha,’ thuirt e, ‘gum bi na h-uachdarain, air gach taobh dhen abhainn os cionn Bhlàr Ghobharaidh, a’ leagail a h-uile craobh a chuireas stad air iasgair bho bhith a’ siabadh le slat.’ Dh’aontaich an rìgh, agus bha còraichean iasgaich aig cinneadh Nèill fad bhliadhnaichean.Bha e nàdarrach, ma-thà, gum biodh Niall a’ dol am falach ri taobh na h-aibhne. Bha saighdearan dearga stèidhichte faisg air làimh ann an Srath Àrdail. Lorg Niall còs eadar na creagan, dìreach os cionn bonn Creag an Fhithich. Bha e toilichte gu leòr an sin. Ghlac e bric gu leòr anns an abhainn – dha fhèin is do fheadhainn eile a bha am falach faisg air.Bha e sàbhailte bho na saighdearan dearga, ach cha robh bho thuiltean. Bha uisge mòr ann an Srath Àrdail, agus thàinig tuil – coltach ri làgaraid – sìos Uisge Àrdail agus a-steach don Eireachd. Cha robh fios aig Niall gun robh e a’ tighinn. Gu h-obann thàinig an t-uisge a-steach don chòs aige, agus chaidh a sguabadh a-mach.Bha e ann an cunnart a bheatha. Ach, nuair a bha e fo Chreag an Fhithich, mhothaich e gun robh snàithlean crochte bhon bhearradh gu h-àrd. Ghabh e grèim air agus, ged a bha e tana, bha e làidir gu leòr airson leigeil leis bruach na h-aibhne a ruigsinn. Ghabh e grèim air preas feàrna agus tharraing e e fhèin a-mach às an uisge.Nuair a thug e sùil an-àirde, cò chunnaic e ach taibhs na Baintighearna Liondsaidh le cuigeal na làimh. Ghabh e eagal agus thilg e an ceann aigesan dhen t-snàithlean don uisge. Nuair a rinn e sin, thilg ise a’ chuigeal agus an còrr dhen t-snàithlean don abhainn, agus dh’fhalbh i à fianais.Chan fhacas bhon uair sin i. Bha a h-obair deiseil. Bha a peanas seachad. Bha a’ Bhaintighearna Liondsaidh, murtair, air beatha a-nise a shàbhaladh – fear-leantainn aig cinneadh a seanar, na Stiùbhartaich. Dh’fhaodadh i a bhith marbh a-nise ann an sìth.* * * * *The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/99084785_3118441474886551_2801340647280214016_n-2.jpg","title":"portree lifeboat called to raasay for medical","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe launch took place at . pm.The request originated from the Scottish Ambulance Service and came in response to an ongoing medical emergency on Raasay.

We#ve been looking at the legislation and it doesn#t seem to allow for the FM transmitter we would need to put it into people#s cars, he continued.All it seems to allow for is  nanowatts to be transmitted which would only broadcast from the church to the front bumper of the first car. That#s not enough for people in the car park to hear it. I#ve contacted Ofcom about this a week ago but we#ve had no response. So we still don#t knowthis is even viable.The Executive has said fire ahead with these drive-in services, but they haven#t given us the wherewithal to do them so it#s really a bit of an empty gesture.An Ofcom spokesperson said: Understandably, the church community is exploring alternative ways of reaching their congregations. To broadcast as you describe, however, churches would require a Broadcasting Act licence to stay within the law. Ofcom would consider applications made for a restricted service licence, and information on the dferent types of licences is available on our website. When considering any application, Ofcom would carry out the work necessary to establisha suitable frequency can be identied for use at a power level appropriate for the proposed coverage area.DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said: I#m sorry that churches are not able to be exempt from licences on this occasion. Churches will understand the need to follow the law, but I would hope application processes will be as quick as possible.Elsewhere, a drive-in service is planned for this Sunday near the Giant#s Causeway at Dunseverick Baptist Church. Far from being a novelty, the outdoor services have been a popular fixture for years. Rev Billy Jones last held a service in March just before lockdown measures were introduced.Everyone needs hope at the moment, this isn#t about just going through the ritual of a service. If this achieves nothing , it will give people a lt just from seeing their family and friends across the car park.Rev Trevor McCormick is also aiming to hold outdoor services from next Sunday in both First Kilrea Presbyterian and the nearby Boveedy Church.

Our goal is to give students the grades that best reflect what they would have achieved had they sat the exams in normal circumstances and completed all of their coursework.It has undoubtedly been an anxious time for students and their families, and I am grateful for their patience as we have developed a robust and deliverable solution Justin Edwards, CCEAThe grades for AS and A-levels will be issued on Thursday, August , with the GCSE grades a week later on Thursday, August .Students can have confidence that these grades will have equal status to any other year and should be treated as such by universities, colleges and employers, said Mr Edwards.For every GCSE, AS and A-level subject, CCEA has asked each school, college or other exam centres to submit a centre assessment grade for each student and the rank order of students within each grade.We will then use this data and other information to calculate the grades. CCEA will also apply statistical standardisation to align the judgments across and within centres so that, as far as possible, no student is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged in comparison to previous years.He said an appropriate appeals process is currently being developed for any student who feels that the grades received do not reflect performance.We firmly believe that teachers have an excellent understanding and knowledge of their students# performance and are best placed to provide the holistic and objective information that we need to calculate the final grades, he said.There may be some who feel that grades do not reflect performance. They may choose to sit the examinations at another time or they may wish to appeal. An appropriate appeals process is currently being developed. Public consultation on this work has been launched recently to inform the development process. Interested groups or iniduals are encouraged to contribute views online by Thursday May .It has undoubtedly been an anxious time for students and their families, and I am grateful for their patience as we have developed a robust and deliverable solution. Students can be assured that the grades they receive in August  will reflect their hard work, and it is our fervent aim that they will be able to progress as planned to the next stage of their journey.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I started feeling very unwell at her funeral. I was coughing and coughing. A few days later I couldn#t move. I was so exhausted, I was totally wiped out and had to sleep all the time. The fatigue was like nothing I#ve ever had before, it was unreal. I would go for a shower and have to lie down afterwards. It took so much out of me Janet HetheringtonI couldn#t stop coughing. I tried every single cough medicine but nothing would help this hacking cough. I couldn#t sleep for coughing and that just added to the exhaustion.

I started a new job in the first week of December, he says. In the second week of December I developed a headache and lost my sense of taste and smell. I went completely off food.

The headache was unreal. When it started coming on the news about the coronavirus and there was a list of the symptoms, it made me think. I#m convinced that it was coronavirus. I#ve never been as sick.Though many people are convinced they may have had coronavirus, medical experts disagree. Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Associationand a GP in Londonderry, says he is convinced that the bug making people sick before Christmas was a dferent virus.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it Dr Tom Black, British Medical AssociationThere certainly was a viral illness in December and January, he says. But it wouldn#t have been consistent with what we then found with the Covid virus. From a patient#s point of view you would have got a sore throat, a temperature, felt unwell, some vomiting and diarrhoea as well. So I suppose there are some similarities but that is because they are both viral illnesses. We certainly didn#t see the level of very severe respiratory symptoms that we then saw with Covid.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it.Dr Black says that he disagrees with suggestions that December#s widespread illness was in fact the first wave of coronavirus and that we have just left the deadly second wave.Our microbiology colleagues are very clear about when the infection came and when they were able to pick it up on their very accurate tests, he says. I think we are still in the first wave. The severity of Covid was markedly dferent from a standard flu. It is a much more severe illness in a minority and we didn#t see those patients until we were in the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern IrelandAnd Dr Black says, although there are less patients presenting to our hospitals, the virus is still out there. We have fewer cases appearing into general practice. We have fewer cases coming into the Covid centres that the GPs man and we have fewer cases in hospital and in ICU. So in all four areas we have reduced numbers of cases, he says. It#s not gone yet, it#s still endemic in the community. There seems to be a concentration in two places - in care homes and among health care workers. So we are going to have start increasing our testing of patients and staff in care homes, which has been announced by the minister. And we are going to have to increase our testing among health care workers.As for how many of us might have acquired herd immunity, Dr Black also estimates the numbers are still very low, saying that just % of the Northern Irish population might have had the virus already.

In labs around the globe they are racing against time in a frantic bid to create a Covid- vaccine ­- seen as the key to vanquishing the virus and setting society on the road back to normality.The world is waiting, hoping, expecting, but it is a pressure to deliver that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the scientic world.It is said the best way to tackle an enemy is to understand how that enemy operates, and that is why understanding the nature of Covid- is vital.There is still a lot more to find out .. This is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. The problem is, this is still a very new virus, said Dr Ultan Power, professor in molecular virology at Queen#s University.We have learnt so much about it in such a short space of time, it#s quite remarkable. But there#s still a lot more to find out.We know the virus does not have the ability to mutate in the way influenza changes. It#s not as dramatic as that, but this is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. We still don#t know what it will look like in one or two years# time. That#s an issue to begin with.The simplest way to imagine Covid- is as a tiny tennis ball with #spikes# around the surface, which are formed by proteins.Those spikes interact with another protein on the surface of the human cell called the ACE  Receptor.The spikes help the virus to roll along the cell until it comes across this receptor.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan Power FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan PowerThe ACE  Receptor is the lock, the spike protein is the key. Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

As revealed by the Derry News earlier this month, the proposed bridge would span an intake of water near the Fort George site, expanding the Quay Trail into Bay Road park. The planning application was received by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Service on March  and is in the early stages of consideration. The proposed bridge will provide a link from the city centre to Muff in County Donegal. It is part of the wider North West Greenway Network project which aims to develop .km of cross-border greenway, including: Derry-Buncrana, Derry-Muff, and Lford-Strabane. googletag.cmd.push  Funding for the project has been provided through the EU’s INTERREG VA programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body . Match-funding has been provided by the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport in Ireland. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, welcomed the submission of the planning application. She said: “I am delighted this key infrastructure project, which will complement the emerging City Deal riverfront regeneration plans, has reached this important milestone. Subject to planning approval, it will play a signicant role in connecting people through our infrastructure, facilitating more people to get outdoors and choose sustainable travel options, whilst benefitting peoples’ health and wellbeing.” googletag.cmd.push Paying tribute to everyone involved for advancing project development during this emergency period, Mayor Boyle continued: “Now, more than ever, there is a real need for investment in projects which encourage a more active, healthy lestyle. Once completed, the proposed new bridge will further enhance the City and District’s growing greenway network.” Gina McIntyre, Chief Executive of SEUPB said: “This bridge is an integral section of the North West Greenway Network’s route , which will link Derry to Muff. It will encourage more people to choose an eco-friendly form of travel, one of the core objectives of the EU’s INTERREG VA Programme, which has been designed to support more sustainable forms of transport, on both sides of the border.” She continued: ”It is also important, as we emerge from COVID- restrictions in the coming weeks and months, that we rebuild our society and the economy in a more environmentally-conscious way. This greenway will help support a more socially distanced recovery process, an approach that will pay real and tangible idends for us all in the future.” Further details on the project can be found at www.nwgreenway.

It will allow the first student intake of  in September , she explained, this is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. Speaking after todays Executive announcement where it agreed to establish medical school in Derry and the first student intake of  students in September, MLA for Foyle Karen Mullan said:Todays announcement by the Executive that it plans to establish the graduate medical school at Magee is a major boost for Ulster University and for Derry. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of this investment to the economic regeneration of Derry and to the North West cannot be overstated. I warmly welcome the decision which adds quite signicantly to the City Deals and Inclusive Future Fund commitment announced in recent weeks too. “There is widespread support for the medical school and the expansion of Magee. There is a united voice in the city at political and community levels and todays announcement represents a huge step forward towards the goal of delivering the medical school at Magee in the fastest time possible. Sinn Feacutein is committed to working with Ulster University, local business leaders and all other parties to see the project delivered without any delay. googletag.cmd.push While welcoming the Executive recommitting itself to a medical school as part of the expansion of Magee, SDLP Leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood called for further detail and guarantees on a September  intake. Mr Eastwood said that what’s needed now is more than warm words but a detailed plan and the resource needed to lt the project off the ground. Colum Eastwood MP said: “During the negotiations to restore power sharing, I made it a personal priority to secure not just a political commitment to the expansion of Magee but resource for developing the medical school. That was critical to SDLP support for the Executive. I welcome the statement from the First Ministers recommitting to university expansion in Derry today. “What people here need is more than warm words or restated promises. We need a guarantee from the Executive and from Ulster University that the first students will enrol starting in September  and we need to see a plan for university expansion beyond that. The medical school is the first step, not the end product. “I will work constructively with all parties to deliver on the potential of our university. Providing young people with the opportunity to study, work and make a le for themselves here is a priority for me. Today’s news must be something genuinely new, rehashing previous commitments or announcements will not be enough. Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton said all parties have worked hard to secure the medical school. Mr Middleton said: “Enhanced commitment from the Executive for the graduate medical school is very welcome. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. During the Confidence and Supply Agreement, Gregory Campbell was able to bring the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to the City to show him the potential. Indeed, with support across the British Isles, this key project has been able to be moved in the right direction. It is a symbol of what can be done when people work together. I hope in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” The British Government backed a medical school in Derry in the New Decade, New Approach document. Former Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, who helped broker the deal also welcomed the news saying: Great news for Derry - such great community commitment to this project - well done to all involved in the campaign. A new decade and a new approach to ALL parts of Northern Ireland being delivered.

The cross border and cross community project is for young people aged  to  and allows them to be the voice for the young people in theNorthWest. It normally includes residential and activity based work, study visits, local workshops, confidence building and skills development. However, these were all cancelled due to the lockdown. Project Manager of theNorthWestMinistryofYou thProject , Barry Fennell, decided to use video conferencing technology to allow the group to continue to come together and share ideas. googletag.cmd.push TheTheNorthWestMinistry ofYouthhas successfully managed to harness the new technology to continue their work and has now set up a series of sub committees to look at employability, learning, health, sport and the environment. As the project progresses the group will put together a youth manesto which will lay out the changes they would like to see in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area. Mr Fennell said the group have adapted remarkably well to the changes in their circumstances. They have been brilliant in terms of their ability to continue and they are very switchedon. We are still having our weekly meetings through Zoom and that allows us to keep those connections at this time and try and continue with this project as well. googletag.cmd.push Co-chair of the group Plunkett Roarty, who is in Year  at Lumen Christi College, said video conferencing is the next best thing to meeting face to face. Due to the coronaviruscrisis we have had to use resources such as Zoom to stay in contact and come together to share ideas and tackle the key issues, he said. Plunkett is part of the Department for Health and Well-being which is tackling issues such as mental health and positive body image. At the minute we are at the discussion stage aboutplans and initiatives to tackle that, he explained. Video conferencing is a useful tool and we are still able to get a lot done. The members of the group are also enjoying the chance to socialise online. With school being off and all my sports training being cancelled the Zoom meetings area chance to meet up and see familiar faces who are facing the same issues as you, said Plunkett.North West Ministry of Youth – Youth Voices Project is delivered by Co-operation Ireland and Education Authority. This opportunity is funded by the EU’s PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body.

Derry  Strabane People Before Profit Cllrs Eamonn McCann and Shaun Harkin said: People Before Profit joins other parties in welcoming the announcement that the Stormont Executive has approved a graduate-entry Medical School at Magee.We take this as a down-payment on the first instalment of what Stormont owes to the working-class people of the North West.Every place in the proposed medical school will be a boost for Derry - and will whet Derry’s appetite for delivery of the rest of what’s been promised.However, we mustn’t allow approval of the medical school to ert attention from the target agreed by all parties of , extra full-time student places. Approval of the medical school cannot be a substitute for expansion of third-level education generally. We wont be settling for  additional students a year when the numbers have been cut by hundreds in recent years.The embarrassing scramble for political credit for getting the medical school approved is in full swing. The fact is that every party in the North West with elected representatives has fully supported the medical school. The task now is not to demand a share of success but to recognise how far short this falls from what Derry has demanded down through the years.And we must keep in mind that all that we have so far is the promise. It is not cynical, particularly not in Derry, to say that we’ll fully believe it when we clearly see it. googletag.cmd.push And questions still remain about who will deliver third-level education provision here. The institution with that responsibility doesnt have the trust of those whove witnessed its deliberate policy of downgrading Derry for decades.It was possible to believe for  years that the reason Derry had been cheated of third-level education was that sectarian unionism didn’t want proper development of gerrymandered Derry. But that explanation won’t wash now.In the last  years, Derry has had Deputy First Ministers, Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Education etc. - all from a nationalist background. Those establishment parties have systematically let the people of Derry and the North West down and delivery of the medical school wont make up for their failures.We shouldn’t stop to savour this interim success, but rather take it as encouragement to push on towards full delivery of Derry’s entitlement. We will continue on our present path, working with other parties and campaign groups, including trades unions and student unions, to bring this saga to success at last. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

The -plus-style exams are due to ahead in November and December, two weeks later than planned. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been calls for the organisations that run the tests to call them off. In his role as Apostolic Administrator for the Diocese of Dromore, Archbishop Eamon Martin has written a letter making the same appeal to Catholic schools in that diocesan area. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, has sent a similar letter to grammar schools in the city in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in his diocese. googletag.cmd.push In a letter to school principals and governors, Archbishop Martin, a former President of St Columbs College in Derry, said he was aware that anxiety was building. He said parents and teachers had shared their disquiet and uncertainty that was already upsetting some children. I know that teachers have been providing helpful study packs and online resources to assist with home schooling. Parents are doing their best to respond, while juggling work and home commitments, and in some cases overseeing learning for several children at once. Some pupils are responding well others are struggling, without ready access to technology or the one-to-one assistance of their teachers. googletag.cmd.push A school principal observed to me that he anticipates educational disadvantage will be exacerbated given this years special circumstances. There was a likelihood of children ing to school in phases in September, he added, and pupils may require additional emotional support. With this in mind, and in the best interests of our children and schools, I appeal to the whole educational community to support a suspension of the use of academic selection for entrance to post-primary schools in , he added. I urge the boards of governors to publish admissions criteria which do not rely on the use of transfer tests carried out under such uncertain and challenging circumstances. Archbishop Martin added: In making this appeal for a suspension of the use of academic selection in the coming year, I have no desire to simply re-open the arguments for, and against, the transfer tests. I make this call from my heart on behalf of the current Primary Six children, their families and all our school communities, he concluded. In his letter, Bishop Donal McKeown said that socially disadvantaged pupils would be seriously disadvantaged in the transfer tests as they would have been out of school for almost six months. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to pupils and in the interest of maintaining a mix of pupils in the school community, I would ask your board of governors to consider how you could respond to this, he wrote. This may well be a situation where criteria other than transfer test grades should be included for at least a substantial proportion of the  entry cohort.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

With thousands more claimants now trying to access welfare support – many for the first time – the pressure on local advice services has never been higher. Applications have sky rocketed, as employers struggle to source support for employees as well as secure the long-term future of their business, and families seek aid as they face the sudden stark reality of le without a regular income. googletag.cmd.push The community and voluntary sector in Derry has mobilised to provide a network of support, and one vital component in that resilience effort are the local advice service organisations who are providing round the clock guidance and information for those in most dficulty. They have seen a surge in demand for information on support mechanisms such as the Job Retention Scheme, Self-employment Income Support, Statutory Sick Pay, Universal Credit and mortgage advice. Jacqueline Gallagher is manager of the newly branded Advice North West – formerly Citizens Advice Bureau. Used to dealing face to face with their customers, they have been adjusting to the challenge of working remotely assisting people by email and phone and the limitations that brings. googletag.cmd.push Weve been so busy since we entered lockdown, it is a time of great uncertainty for many in our communities with a large volume of iniduals and families worried about their security of income, housing and employment, she explains. We have dealt with a large influx of people who have had to access the benefit system for the first time. “This can be a time-consuming process at any time but with the inability to provide face to face advice services we have had to be inventive in our approach to surmount the current social constraints and limitations. Its very tough for people who have never before had to navigate the benefit system and are now having to do so in such unexpected and upsetting circumstances. “They are afraid of not being able to pay back debts, losing their homes, not being able to feed their families – its an unbelievably anxious time. “The dficulty is that everyones situation is dferent, so each person needs a specially tailored approach. Our team dedicates themselves to ensuring the wellbeing of those who access our services. Jude McKinney is the Welfare Rights Manager of the Resource Centre Derry where the team has also been adjusting to new ways of working introduced to fast track services that are under increasing pressure. It really has been a challenge for our team, he admits. We definitely saw a major spike in demand for services at the start as we had a lot of new issues to deal with. We received advance funding from Council and we have been allocated additional money through the Community Fund which helped us to meet this initial demand for services. We anticipated having to cover a lot of additional hours to allow for the extra filling out of forms. “When we first entered lockdown we saw a huge surge in claims for things like employment benefit, self-employment support and the self-isolation job retention scheme. “Then when the furloughing scheme was announced – something which no one was familiar with – it was another challenge helping both employers and employees understand how the scheme works to benefit them. We can no longer facilitate face to face appointments which is in itself challenging and we anticipated it would mean a lot of extra out of hours work for our staff. But thankfully there have been some fantastic measures introduced by the Department for Communities in terms of easement. They stepped in to introduce a number of easement mechanisms including a six-month extension of payments for existing claims, which has meant we havent had to process a huge volume of renewal forms like for example Work Capability Assessments. “We can also now sign on a claimants behalf so they no longer have to come in to the centre to sign forms, which has been a big help. While this has given us a bit more breathing space we now anticipate there will be a spike in form filling come September and October. So there are definitely more pressures waiting down the line. Its hard to imagine how we will ever resume normal ways of working. I think this will all lead to a review of how we deliver advice services which will see it transformed in the long-term and I think we have a long way to go before we thingsto any kind of normality. Dove House is located in the heart of the Bogside in Derry, an area already suffering from high levels of deprivation. Welfare Advice Coordinator Donna Burke and the team of eight advisors based there have been inundated by calls from new claimants, but are buoyed up by the strength of the community resilience efforts in the area. I can see how it can be so frustrating for anyone trying to access benefits when there is so much uncertainty and change at the moment, weve had to adapt as best we can, she admits. The biggest concern is quite simply ensuring that people have enough money to live on. Its as basic as that. “With so many new claimants, they have to get registered which can be a complicated process in itself, but then we have to explain to them that they will have to wait until that support comes through which leaves people extremely anxious. “There can be no room for error. Thats upsetting for our advisors as well. Im so proud of our team – they are going above and beyond the call of duty every day – no one is turned away evenit means calling people back over and over again to make sure we can get them the help they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its a cycling pandemic, joked Brian Cassidy of Claudy Cycles, who hasnt seen demand like this during his  years in business. First it was toilet roll and now its bicycles. I have had people queuing right out to the gate and people haveactually texted me thinking there was a wake going on because they saw all the cars parked on the road. Groups of cyclists have become a familiar sight across the city as people take advantage of their daily exercise allowance to get out and about on two wheels. googletag.cmd.push The country is going mad for bikes, said Mr Cassidy, who is working from am until pm at night delivering and repairing them. Everybody is on furlough and once they got their new fences built and painted they all wanted a bike. With manufacturing halted in China due to the globalpandemic, bike supplies have dried up and Mr Cassidy estimates it could be up to two weeks beforehe has them in stock again. Theres not a bike to be got at the minute, he said. I was selling bikes to people as far away as Sligo and people were buying them after only seeing a picture on WhatsApp. googletag.cmd.push Mr Cassidy has also seen a huge upsurge in repairs as people across Derry pull their neglectedbikes out of attics and garden sheds. People are digging up these old relics to be fixed, he laughed. Ive been surprised with some of the things people are bringing to me and of course they all want them done today. Will Ennett from the Northland Road has been getting out and about on his new bike during lockdown, which has a specially built trailer for his two kids Rose, , and Johnny, . The children love the novelty of it and wehave been discovering lots of new places like Ebrington Square and the old railway line at the Foyle Road, he said. Its a new hobby and something I plan to keep up once lockdown is over. Halfords has also seen a surge in bike orders at itsCrescent Link store which is currently closedto the public, but is offering a click and collect service. If you were looking for a bike today you would struggle to find one that is in stock, said storemanager, Colm Shiels. We get three deliveries a week and they come in the back door and we build them and then they are going out the front door to customers. We have been flat out, its been like Christmas. So what is the appeal of cycling during lockdown  People love the freedom to get out and about, Mr Shiels explained. The gyms and swimming pools are closed so people who are used to daily exercise are having to think of dferent ways to do it. For some people cycling is a way to justy some bad habits they might have taken up duringlockdown. Businesshas also gone through the roof for Bee Cycles repair service. A spokesperson for Bees Cycles said they were strugglingto cope with demand. It feels like we are busy  , there had never been anything like it before. It has been hard to keep up with demand but its great to see. News of the massive increase in the sale of bikes in Derry comes just days after plans were announced to create a new Cycling Champion role in the city. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said earlier this month that she wants to appoint a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support our new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better. “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Finally delivering the Medical School would be a lasting legacy to the efforts of our frontline healthcare staff during this crisis. “I am very pleased that we will finally have a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee. It is testament to the combined efforts of those across business, education, healthcare and politics, who have worked together on this campaign. As part of the wider City Deal for Derry City and Strabane, the Medical School will drive real economic and social change across the North West and help address years of underfunding and underinvestment in the region.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it. When it all came together it was perfect, he remarked.The dad-of-two hopes the book will facilitate big le changes, particularly in the current climate with older generations taking the biggest impact of Covid-.He said: ldquoI think now wersquove been gted more and more time with our families and lots of people are using that time to read to their kids so I think the book is perfect for this current situation.ldquoWhen it was first launched a lot of people asked who was the target audience and who was it geared towards.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area.

Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months. Australia has recorded only  deaths for the whole country out of , confirmed coronavirus cases.The countryrsquos plan to ensure that all people coming into the country will be forcibly quarantined was something that he believed was essential to happen.ldquoOver here, they mean what they say, said Gareth. ldquoWe have been told that for new visitors into the country will be guarded to ensure that they comply with the quarantine.Gareth said that as he and Emmah, who works in traffic control, lived in Newtown, a few miles from the centre of Sydney, they were still able to go to the beach to enjoy during the lockdown.ldquoThere are so many beaches close to us here that we are spoilt for choice, he continued. ldquoThe beaches were reopened a few weeks ago so we could go for a swim, surf, walk or run. Thatrsquos all considered part of your exercise and itrsquos to be able to enjoy that.He said people were still not allowed to sunbathe but that being able to go out to the beach made up for the lack of other social access and activity.ldquoWe have a lot of friends here, particularly other people like ourselves who are all from the same area, and we are missing out being able to meet up with them in bars and restaurants, ldquo said Gareth.ldquoWe are very fortunate that we have been able to go out to the beach on an evening after work, so it doesnrsquot feel like we are so cooped up and we both really love the outdoors le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Tribute.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Bears’ chairman who loved sport  ","story":"TOLLYMORE United FC chairman John McIlvenny passed away peacefully at his home last week after a long battle against a very debilitating illness.John was involved in the Tollymore club since its formation in  and was chairman for  of its  years. He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

It might just be that the first minister was adopting a dferent tone, as opposed to a dference of substance.Butthe transfer tests were suspended, it would be devastating blow to Northern Ireland’s grammar schools — one from which they might not recover.The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, who has called for such suspension in the Catholic sector, would not be unhappyacademic selection never ed because his church strongly opposes selection — which is, obviously, an entirely legitimate stance.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

While many all ability schools are of course excellent, those best performing Catholic schools would neverto such heights without a selective intake.That, while a great pity, would ultimately be a matter for the Catholic education sector. If grammar schools as a whole disappear, however, then NI will become like England: selection will be based on wealth, not on any semblance of merit.Academic selection, for all its imperfections, is vastly preferable to a wealth based system. The ruling class in the UK is now dominated by ex public school pupils, because of the disastrous consequences of abolishing grammar schools.Yet the campaign to dismantle NI’s grammars is relentless, evenoften below the radar. Any attempt to move to teacher assessment, for example, could lead to major iations in standards and so to injustices for unfairly assessed pupils. It would be one day be followed by a demand that all selection is abolished, which would be a huge and retrograde step.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

All together.Asked why the extra messaging was being introduced, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said there is a need to explain the ldquodferent elements involved.He told Sky News: ldquoStay alert is very much still part of what it is all about.ldquoI think what wersquore trying to do is explain underneath that general direction what that means. vw,vw,px, px\"Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said lsquomore nuancedrsquo messaging is involved in the lsquoStay alertrsquo slogan ldquoOf course the dferent elements to staying alert, which include washing hands, keeping our distance, builds up to that general approach which is that we all must be very much aware not only of each other but what we can do in order to minimise the inadvertent transmission of this terrible disease.The Cabinet minister said ldquostay alert is ldquomore dficult to explain than ldquostay at home because it involves ldquomore nuanced messages.ldquoI think lsquostay at homersquo had the clarity and simplicity of a direct instruction this was always going to be a more dficult moment when we had to give more nuanced messages and to encourage everybody to take those small steps out of the full lockdown, he added.ldquoIt is going to be a tough ask it is a very dficult time for everybody and the Government doesnrsquot pretend anything otherwise.ldquoWe have to keep developing those messages and thatrsquos why yoursquore hearing that kind of detail.Critics of the ldquostay alert message include Susan Michie, professor of health psychology and director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London.Prof Michie is a member of the SPI subcommittee of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesndash the body that has been instrumental in guiding ministers through the coronavirus response ndash and said last week that the new direction is not clear enough.She said: ldquoI think the concern with the actual slogan ndash lsquostay alertrsquo ndash is itrsquos not very obvious what alert means, what people should be alert to, and what they should do , when being alert they identy something that isnrsquot defined..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uStay alert u slogan needs more explanation, admits minister article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

COVID- emergency funding for local councils.By The NewsroomTuesday, th May , : pm\"\"This morningCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, informed the Assembly that the Executive had agreed to provide a total of £. million to NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd PartyCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council will continue to ensure vital public services are protected.“Council welcomes the announcement by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, and will continue to work with the Minister, and colleagues across councils, to make the case for support of local government to ensure vital public services are protected,” said the spokesperson.Adam

A poundmillion rates relief package for business sectors hit hardest by the Covid- lockdown was announced by the Finance Minister Conor Murphy today. Building on the poundmillion scheme announced in March which gave all businesses a threemonth rates holiday, the new scheme will result in businesses in the following sectors being relieved of the obligation to pay rates for the full financial year up to  March : * hospitality, tourism and leisure* retail * childcare* Belfast City, Belfast International and City of Derry Airports. All businesses will also receive a one-month extension of the rates holiday up to  July . Minister Murphy confirmed: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the economy. The initial rates support package helped businesses with immediate cash-flow dficulties during the lockdown. As the Executive begins to ease the restrictions which have been necessary to save lives, I am pleased to announce this new scheme which importantly provides all businesses with an extended rates holiday for July. “Further support is then targeted at the sectors which will be in greatest need in the months ahead. This includes retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare and airports. This rates package, which is aligned with the Executive’s pathway to recovery, brings the total support for businesses from rates relief and grants to almost poundmillion.” Education Minister Peter Weir welcomed the Executive’s approval of an income scheme to support substitute teachers who are unable to access secure work during the Covid- shutdown of schools. With many schools closed during the pandemic except those supervising vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers, eligible substitute teachers, who were engaged between  January  to  March , will have access to an income for the period April to June . An additional income through this scheme will top up their income to at least % of that earned in the period. Minister Weir acknowledged: “I am fully aware of the signicant impact this pandemic has had on our pupils, teaching and non-teaching staff. The issue of funding for substitute teachers, who are unable to work and therefore unable to be paid, is one that and I, and my Department, have been working hard to resolve. Today, I am pleased to announce that we will be introducing an income support scheme for substitute teachers through the Covid- Response fund. The estimated total cost of the scheme is around poundmillion. My Department will allocate up to poundmillion and the Executive has agreed to fund the remaining poundmillion. I would also like to thank the Finance Minister for his support in this matter. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced the Executive had allocated an additional poundmillion to support the most vulnerable people in housing during the Covid- emergency. The Supporting People Programme provides housing support for approximately , vulnerable iniduals living independently including: homeless people, older people, young people, and people with physical disabilities, learning disabilities and mental health issues. The additional funds will help maintain Supporting People services, which are commissioned by the Housing Executive and delivered through the public and voluntary and community sectors. Minister Hargey explained: “The additional funding will be used to address signicant staff shortages in the immediate term and mounting pressure in this area,the number of Covid- cases continues to increase. The money will fund overtime costs for existing staff and the use of the bank or agency staffing that is necessaryservices are to be maintained. Extra cleaning is also required, and the matter of a sufficient and adequate supply of PPE is being addressed.  “These are unusual times which demand actions and solutions. This funding allocation represents our commitment to the vulnerable people in Supporting People schemes, and the staff providing support to them. We support them and we are working hard to ensure their safety and wellbeing.” The allocation was also welcomed by Health Minister Robin Swann who added: “It is well recognised that supported living services better enable people to live to their full potential and reduce the need for acute health and social care services. Their value in society cannot be underestimated. “Officials across both departments are in regular communication to identy and address Covid- priorities across our Supporting People schemes. As a result my Department has now extended Covid- testing to all staff and residents of Supporting People schemes as well as providing a temporary supply of Personal Protective Equipment.” It was revealed by Minister Hargey that local councils will also be given pound.million to alleviate financial pressures as a result of the Covid- restrictions. The funding will ensure councils can continue to provide essential services and support those in need. Minister Hargey said: “Despite the current Covid- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in delivering essential services such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemetery services. The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring our health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities. “This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time but will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.” The Minister previously announced that councils here are eligible to apply to furlough staff through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. This will help ensure that the rights of workers are respected and jobs are protected. This scheme along with this additional funding are supporting councils through this period.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baadebcfbfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cceacd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
