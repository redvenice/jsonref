Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake,\u0027 he said. He went on to share his \u0027fondest\u0027 memory of hs estranged half-sibling. \u0027My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two years prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time. \u0027She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree.          Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in an extraordinary ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday. Thomas Markle Jr. was not invited \u0027It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special,\u0027 he said. He said it was \u0027understandable\u0027 that she threw herself into the role of a lifetime on Suits and, despite previous comments, now doesn\u0027t blame her for it.                              \u0027It\u0027s hard on everybody. Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake                        \u0027When she went to Toronto, and jumped right into that, it was her biggest role. When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, away from your family and away from contact.\u0027And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart.\u0027If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phone call.\u0027We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA.\u0027Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family,\u0027 he said. Considering himself an expert on the occasion, he predicted that the bride\u0027s dress would be \u0027the nicest dress anyone has ever seen\u0027.   Thomas\u0027s sister Samantha has also launched astonishing attacks on Meghan (seen together right in 2008)          On Saturday, Samantha continued her cashing-in crusade by inviting a TV crew round to her Ocala, Florida, home to watch the wedding \u0027The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. \u0027It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it.

The Duchesse ivory silk-satin creation took royal couturier Sir Norman and his team three months to finishWith a heart-shaped neckline with scalloped edge, the gown was decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, glittering crystals and featured an intricate 13ft star-patterned train. Embroidered with roses, star-shaped flowers and wheat in pearl, crystal and appliques of transparent tulle, its floral design was seen as a symbol of growth and regeneration after the hardships of the Second World War. On the day of the wedding at Westminster Cathedral, the seamstresses who worked tirelessly on the gown were given a prime spot outside Buckingham Palace as a reward.  The Queen, like all British brides in the post-war days, was given 200 extra clothing coupons from the Government towards her wedding trousseau.Women across the UK, keen to ensure Princess Elizabeth would have the dress of her dreams, sent their own coupons to the young royal to help out.But it was illegal to give coupons away and the gifts had to be returned.  However, The Crown gave a good idea of how much the dress might cost to make today as designers for the BBC programme created an identical gown for the wedding scene, which cost £30,000.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

These days it is used mainly for entertainingIn fact, their dinner party had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast, with Harry’s favourite House tracks ‘curated’ by DJ Sam Totolee (who also performed at Pippa Middleton’s wedding), a ‘drinks of the world’ themed bar, and candyfloss and ‘dirty burgers’ as midnight snacks.One source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was put on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry’s red hair. It was named ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, a play on the film When Harry Met Sally.The party was a notably relaxed, more youthful occasion than the afternoon reception.The intimate guestlist of 200 meant there was no room for mere acquaintances, nor even many minor Royals. Pippa Middleton and Harry’s party-girl ex Chelsy Davy were expected to be absentees.There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertaining.The sit-down dinner was strictly organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed ‘spring meets summer’. The meal, paid for by the Prince of Wales, started at 7.30pm and finished at around 10pm.Its three courses were understood to have been peppered with ‘naughty’ speeches from Prince William and a joint effort from Tom Inskip, known as ‘Skippy’ and Tom Van Straubenzee. Any crude nods to Prince Harry’s playboy past were held back until the older guests had departed.Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027          The revamped classic car\u0027s number plate read \u0027E190518\u0027 - a tribute to the newlywed\u0027s wedding date. It also had an EU stamp on the plate Inskip – Harry’s closest confidante – was also under strict instructions to downplay Prince Harry’s Las Vegas trips – all before he met Meghan.Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone. Another party had been planned in a soundproofed private home in Chelsea.It was quite a contrast with the earlier ‘stand-up’ wedding breakfast in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall, which saw 600 guests enjoy ‘bowl food’ and canapes such as Scottish langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon, croquette of confit Windsor Lamb and champagne and pistachio macarons. Harry and his father then gave speeches. Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said of Harry’s speech: ‘He was talking about his wife. Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.’She described a speech by the Prince of Wales as ‘lovely’, adding: ‘Essentially it was just about how Harry was as a child and growing up. And about the couple and how beautiful they are together.’Another guest said: ‘Charles nailed it in his speech. He talked about Harry being a baby needing bottles and diapers, then said: “Look how well he turned out.” ’    Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone.

Harry and Meghan had already spoken in their engagement interview of their passion for the Commonwealth and their hopes for engaging with its young people.

Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.

The stunning leather interior of the car driven by the Duke of Sussex away from Windsor CastleIt was known in-house as ‘Project Dylan’, a nod to singer-song-writer Bob Dylan’s controversial switch in the mid 1960-s from acoustic to electric guitar when one traditionalist fan shouted ‘Judas.’But converting the classic E-Type means owners can ‘future proof’ their classic cars, says Jaguar. The original engine can even, if required, be swapped back.It can accelerate from rest to 62mph in 5.5 seconds – about a second faster than the original petrol version – with a top speed 150mph. However, with Prince Harry at the wheel he appeared to be taking things much more sensibly.The electric E-Type claims a ‘real world’ range of about 170 miles though that could increase to just over 200 miles. So there was little risk of running out of juice for the short hop between engagements at Windsor.It can be fully charged at home overnight in about six to seven hours with the fuel cap flap opening to reveal the electric charging point.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drive off from Windsor Castle in a fully electric version of Jaguar’s legendary E-Type sports car          Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027If they had time to to avert their gaze from each other, the road ahead, and the cheering well-wishers, Harry and Meghan may have had time to admire how the original dashboard has been replaced with hi-tech carbon-fibre and the classic instruments given a digital revamp with hi-tech ‘virtual’ dials showing road speed and engine speed.But all other underpinnings, including brakes and suspension are the same, to ensure it still drives like the ‘original’ E-Type.The one-off electric E-Type would cost around £350,000 although Jaguar says prices could drop as more orders are received. But with its new royal connection, this one could now be priceless.Tim Hannig, director, Jaguar Land Rover Classic, said other models could follow: ‘Our aim with E-type Zero is to future-proof classic car ownership.’‘The Jaguar E-type Zero not only drives and looks like an E-type, it also offers outstanding performance. It’s quicker than an original E-type: 0-62mph takes only 5.5 sec, about one second quicker than a Series 1 E-type. But it is authentic to its DNA.’Jaguar said the restored Series 1.5 Roadster is’ totally original apart from its 21st century electric powertrain and modified instrumentation and facia. It also has LED headlights to save energy. The Zero’s lithium-ion battery pack has the same dimensions as the original XK six-cylinder petrol engine and sits in precisely the same place. The 220kW motor lies just behind the battery pack where the original gearbox used to be.          Under the bonnet: Jaguar have replaced the powerful petrol engine with a zero emissions electric motor and plug-in battery          The boot of the stunning Jaguar driven by the Duke of Sussex on Saturday after his weddingOne of Jaguar’s own restored ‘Reborn’ range – with a petrol engine - would be £280,000. Classic E-Types can cost from around £70,000, depending on condition. Back in the 1960s a new E-Type cost just a few thousand pounds.The electric E-Type Zero was one of three battery-powered cars that Jaguar showcased at its special ‘Tech Fest’ event in London last Autumn.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive officer Dr Ralf Speth said: ‘Every new Jaguar Land Rover model line will be electrified from 2020, giving our customers even more choice. We will introduce a portfolio of electrified products across our model range, embracing fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.’There is already a strong link between the Royal Family and Jaguar Land Rover.In April Prince Charles became the first VIP to be seen in Jaguar’s new I-PACE electric car – on the day that the heir to the throne was confirmed as the Queen’s successor as head of the Commonwealth.He used the all-new electric Jaguar I-PACE for official duties at during the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meetings – having been kept abreast of its hi-tech and environmentally-friendly development towards more ‘green’ electric cars for more than a year.The new I-PACE was unveiled at the Geneva motor in Spring with first customer deliveries begin in June priced from £62,000 to £84,000. The zero-emissions coupe accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds with a top speed of 298 miles and enough battery charge to drive 300 miles from London to Newcastle on one charge.Jaguar Land Rover his the only car maker to hold three royal warrants: from the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles. JLR’s German-born chief executive Dr Ralf Speth has an honorary knighthood, which ca be granted to foreign nations, but recently took up UK citizenship.The Queen is regularly seen and photographed driving Land Rovers around her royal estates and, as Hon Second Subaltern Princess Elizabeth, trained during the war as a truck mechanic with the Territorial Service ‘ATS’.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/01/4C6A304B00000578-0-image-m-191_1526690224906.jpg","title":"Ocado chief pocket record 110m bonuses","story":"Share this articleSteiner arriving at the High Court in London with lawyer Fiona Shackleton (pictured left) for the settlement hearing in his orce hearing with wife Belinda Steiner (right picture)Ocado has racked up large losses over the years, and reported its first pre-tax profit only in 2015.

So I believe most of the UK\u0027s fishing infrastructure should be based north of the border.\u0027                           The commission, chaired by former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, was set up in 2016 to look at economic policy options for an independent Scotland.It will call for Scotland to get its own currency and have its own monetary policy. Ms Sturgeon said: \u0027As you know we\u0027ve had a growth commission looking at the economic opportunities of independence.\u0027Its report will be published in the coming days and I think that\u0027s quite an important moment, because if you think about the last couple of years in the UK it has been very much a debate about how we cope with the damage of Brexit.\u0027What I think Scotland now has the opportunity to do is look at how we seize the opportunities that lie ahead, so a debate based very much on ambition and hope not a debate that\u0027s based on despair, which is how the Brexit debate so often feels.\u0027 Scottish Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said: \u0027The SNP Growth Commission has always been more about promoting independence than it was about growing the economy.\u0027Therefore it is no surprise that Nicola Sturgeon is using this report to begin another push for IndyRef2.\u0027The plan to create a Scottish pound is wholly unworkable, and would be deeply damaging to our businesses trading with the rest of the UK.\u0027The SNP will pursue independence at any cost, and the cost to the Scottish public will be staggering.\u0027Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: \u0027The idea that a separate Scotland would seek to use the pound without a central bank behind it is a recipe for instability and is the economics of dereliction. We would give up our say over interest rate policy, exchange rate policy and inflation.\u0027Scotland does not need, and the people of Scotland do not want, this tired argument again. The SNP should recognise that, and focus instead on jobs, schools and hospitals.\u0027 Andrew Bowie, Scottish Tory MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, told MailOnline: Quite frankly the Scottish people, already the highest taxed in the UK, are fed up with the SNPs obsession with independence when they should be getting on dealing with the crises in Scottish schools and health boards.\u0027The Scottish Government are using the Brexit process to play politics with the constitution, causing uncertainty for businesses north and south of the border and this latest from Nicola Sturgeon threatens even more.\u0027It\u0027s clear the SNP are out of time and out of ideas and I know the Scottish people see right through it.\u0027  It comes after Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson called for the UK to become less London-centric to protect the union.She called for major institutions, like the British Museum, to consider setting up elsewhere in the UK, as well as for most fishing infrastructure to be moved to Scotland. She writes: \u0027As long as our future relationship with the EU is in flux, it would be foolish to assume that the current trends on Scotland remaining in the UK will hold and that the threat of separation has gone away.\u0027The SNP is in power north of the border and will use that clout to drive a wedge between Scotland and the rest of the country.\u0027So we unionists must work hard to bolster our case for the union.\u0027Ms Davidson urged the UK Government to \u0027develop better practices\u0027 to recognise the reality of devolution and build relationships with Edinburgh.She continued: \u0027We also need to spread the benefits of the union fairly and equally around the nation. The UK is still too London-centric.\u0027She added: \u0027More cultural institutions - like the British Museum - should set up second homes outside the capital. More government posts should be based in other parts of the UK.\u0027With Brexit, we have an opportunity to ensure the powers that return to these shores are based nearer the communities they serve.\u0027Most of the UK\u0027s fish, for example, are caught in waters off Scotland.

As the crocs slither around, my colleague struggles manfully to claw up the chicken and fling it at their snapping jaws.          Today\u0027s scene is where Bond is in captivity and introduced to the crocodiles by Tee Hee, who is casually feeding them chicken with this gadgetOne piece sticks to his hook and a croc seems to have its eye on it, causing Julius to back away somewhat smartly then another piece of chicken falls to his feet unnoticed by us — but not by an 8ft croc, which is torpedoing towards us to get it until someone kicks the grisly lump of meat into the swamp in the nick of time.Rather to our relief, Harry Saltzman, the co-producer, says that tomorrow the main unit, including me, will switch to the bus chase sequence, while the second unit stays to get painstaking shots of the crocs crunching their chicken.B-Day 38. At this stage in the plot, Bond becomes a bus driver. I jump into the driving seat, Jane Seymour — who plays Solitaire — clambers aboard, and we use it to escape from pursuing police. This bus, shipped over from London, is a normal double-decker that has spent the best years of its life on the No 19 run.In preparation for the scene in which it whizzes under a low bridge, the upper deck has been cut away and placed on rollers so that when the crash comes it will shoot spectacularly backwards, leaving Bond and Solitaire in the bottom half.In charge of the bus and here to teach me how to handle it is Maurice Patchett, a London Transport driving instructor who has flown in specially.          Rather to our relief, Harry Saltzman, the co-producer, says that tomorrow the main unit, including me, will switch to the bus chase sequenceB-Day 39. A slow day. It looks as if we might all be stuck here for Christmas — efforts to charter a plane back to Britain for December have hit trouble. I would not be too disturbed by the thought as my family is with me, but there would be a revolt among the film crew who would miss their wives, children and Christmas cheer.B-Day 40. If I never land another film role, I can always get a job on the buses. To qualify as a London bus driver takes ten days\u0027 instruction, and Maurice says that I am doing very nicely indeed.The cab of a London bus is full of gadgets. Maurice is particularly careful to explain the function of a small red flag that drops down in an emergency.\u0027When you see that,\u0027 he warns, \u0027put your foot down on the brake and don\u0027t lift it off again because you don\u0027t get a second chance. It means your brakes have gone.\u0027For the first shot, I have to drive the bus fast for 20ft to where an electrician stands in the road with sun reflector boards to get the proper lighting effect.The boards are striking the sun right into my eyes and, as I take off as fast as I can, it is difficult to see where to stop. I do it four times, each time getting a little faster, so the electricians with the reflector boards are side-stepping more rapidly each time.On the last take, I hit the brake and down comes the red flag I keep my foot down hard and pull on the handbrake. If Maurice hadn\u0027t told me about it, there would have been one electrician as flat as his reflector board, under an AEC Regent London bus.Amazingly, we get the shots we want, and first time. A tremendous end to B-Day 40.B-Day 47. Fire and 1,300 ferocious crocodiles make this a day to remember, and I am lucky to have lost no more than the hair on my hands and arms.We shoot the scene where Bond, encircled by crocodiles, escapes from the island near a shed where the villains\u0027 workers are packing heroin. Bond surrounds it with benzene-soaked rags and rubber, and lays a trail of chicken pieces from the swamp to the shed door.An alligator slithers from the swamp, follows the trail through a gate and inside the shed. We see workers tumbling over each other to get out of the door on the other side, but Bond has lit the rags and ringed the building in flames.To escape from the island, Bond makes a death-defying leap over the crocodile-infested water. I am glad we get this shot in the can quickly because I must confess my \u0027bottle\u0027 is twitching.\u0027Bottle\u0027, for those unfamiliar with rhyming slang, is short for \u0027bottle and glass\u0027, which rhymes with what was twitching.          We are moving back to Britain, where most of the rest of the film will be shot at Pinewood Studios, not far from my homeWhen it comes to the burning building, our special effects have a field day. The shed is circled in a sheet of fire, and before I can dodge back the licking flames have singed all the hair off my hands and arms.However, the whole thing goes beautifully, and our star alligator, Daisy, crawls on cue through the gate and into the hut.Ross has had Daisy since she was eight, and she is now 30. From the moment he saw the Live And Let Die script, Ross trained her to walk up the bank at a certain spot, choosing a nice, shady place she fancied, and fed her there.When Daisy was familiar with her walk, the construction team then moved in and built the hut at the end of it. Daisy is quite a tough lady she is the alligator who killed two crocodiles and duffed up three more, losing half her teeth in the conflict, which upset Ross because she is unlikely to grow any more.Personally, I confess that I am not at all perturbed.B-Day 49. We are moving back to Britain, where most of the rest of the film will be shot at Pinewood Studios, not far from my home.After a lot of transatlantic telephone talking, a DC-10 charter flight for England has been fixed for December 20, and before then we must have a clear day to pack our ten tons of equipment, plus personal belongings and close the offices.It\u0027s hard to believe it\u0027s nearly Christmas. The children are looking forward to going home to the pony and the dog I am looking forward to Sunday papers, English marmalade, frosty mornings and seeing my mother and father.B-Day 58. My big love scene with Jane. Despite the fact that her father-in-law, Richard Attenborough, is one of my best friends, and her husband, Michael, has had dinner at our house, it is still an enjoyable experience, even if she is wearing thick tights and knickers under her flimsy negligee!It reminds me of something Joan Collins said when she visited us for lunch on Sunday with her husband, Ron Kass. Doing a love scene with a leading man she detested, she armed herself with tights and the heaviest pair of football socks that she could find. Jane, cuddling a hot water bottle between takes, complains of the cold, but stoically reminds herself that it is all in a good cause.B-Day 59. I get out of bed, do my work-out, have a shower, shave, brush my teeth, get dressed, eat my breakfast of scrambled eggs, get into the car, drive to the studio, take my clothes off, and get back into bed with Jane Seymour. It\u0027s a hell of a way to earn a living!B-Day 64. We are having dramas with the première date because the Duke of Edinburgh won\u0027t be available, nor will Princess Anne, nor Prince Charles, who is at sea with the Royal Navy. It looks like the date will have to be changed.B-Day 66 and I have spent a romantic weekend in Paris with my wife Luisa after an early wrap on Friday.The weekend isn\u0027t all pleasure, though. Co-producer Harry Saltzman asks me if I will visit the Crazy Horse cabaret, and look the girls over for a likely lass to play a scene in the picture that calls for a busty beauty.Ever devoted to duty, I stoically sit through two hours of striptease, and Luisa kindly comes along, too.I pass my opinion to Harry and tell him that, if really necessary, I will go back and have another look with him.Oh, the burdens of Bond!          We are having dramas with the première date because the Duke of Edinburgh won\u0027t be available, nor will Princess Anne, nor Prince Charles, who is at sea with the Royal NavyBrenda Arnau, who was such a success on the London stage in Oh! Calcutta!, appears in the movie as a club singer performing the Live And Let Die title song.Paul McCARTNEY has written it, and I have lunch today with the man who is arranging it, George Martin. It is a tremendous piece of music, and I will stick my neck out and say that three weeks from its release it will be No. 1.B-Day 75 is the day I bed my third Bond girl: a lovely Italian secret agent played by the voluptuous Madeline Smith. Our pillow appointment is in a bed in Bond\u0027s London mews — in other words an elegantly furnished construction on \u0027B\u0027 stage at Pinewood.First-time visitors to a film studio are always struck by the fact that sets built for interior shots rarely have roofs, so that light can blaze in from above. As a result, Madeline and I are exposed to freezing draughts, and the bed is icy.Props have not provided hot water bottles, no doubt taking the view that anyone in bed with Madeline will find them superfluous. I bound and rebound in and out of bed all morning, my feet freezing with every leap.It would tarnish Bond\u0027s image to wear woolly socks, and I envy Madeline, who, though bare from the waist up, can slide under the bed clothes she squeals every time my cold feet touch her knees.At this point in the story, Miss Moneypenny — the secretary of secret service boss M — has delivered to Bond an intriguing magnetic watch.During the preamble to the encounter in bed, James embraces the signorina, then, holding the watch magnet near the back zip on her dress, draws his wrist down her spine without touching her.The metal zip responds and the dress falls to the floor.\u0027What a gentle touch you have, James,\u0027 she whispers.\u0027Sheer magnetism,\u0027 I reply.It may seem money for jam being pressed close to the beautiful Madeline, but on the 20th take, your arm is aching, you\u0027ve got cramp in your left foot and your right knee is going to sleep.Part of the trouble is that Madeline\u0027s dress just will not fall far enough down. Costume designer Julie Harris has to go on her knees off camera and gently pull the dress down.As the watch isn\u0027t really magnetic, assistant director Derek Cracknell, nicknamed Crackers, is also on his knees with his hands up Madeline\u0027s skirt, pulling a hidden wire attached to the zip — so the floor around our feet is starting to get pretty crowded.When I arrive home, the children ask me, as they always do: \u0027What did you do today, Daddy?\u0027I\u0027m not quite sure what to tell them. I can hardly say: \u0027I was in bed with a lady this morning, and I made 20 attempts to take her dress off this afternoon.\u0027After so many months, it is a depleted crowd that flies back to New York to complete the final scenes — it has even crossed my mind that the producers are trying to get out of paying me by having me bumped off in the car chase scenes on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive expressway.Be that as it may, I am still not ready for the phone call that comes on the evening of B-Day 84.It is Crackers, saying with qualifying caution learned from years in the picture business: \u0027All being equal, that is, if the rushes are okayed tomorrow afternoon from London, you are finished on the picture.\u0027This is it, then. The party is over. I feel a terrible sense of anti-climax. Numbed, I mix myself a very stiff drink.Luisa and I are leaving for California Bond co-producer Cubby Broccoli and his wife Dana have kindly loaned us their house in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, where I have been asked to present the Oscar for \u0027Best Actor\u0027.Without wishing to sound too partisan, I hope I hand it to my mate, Michael Caine, nominated for his performance in Sleuth.Later, Joan Collins and husband Ron Kass are bringing our children to join us at the Acapulco house of English songwriter Leslie Bricusse and his wife Evie, where I will recuperate from the rigours of Bond.After jetting the bayous in boats, whizzing around in a wingless plane, courting bites by crocodiles, and crashing cars, I will always wryly recall my last line in Live And Let Die. Delivered to the driver on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive expressway, it is: \u0027Easy, Charlie, let\u0027s get there in one piece.\u0027Give or take a tooth, I have.Adapted from The 007 Diaries: Filming Live And Let Die by Sir Roger Moore, published by The History Press on June 1 at £14.99. © Roger Moore 2018.

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.Sore heads? Wills and Kate cover their eyes with sunglasses...George who-ney? Police keep actor and his wife waiting for...Share this articleAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter’s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"    The 39-year-old British actor-cum-US chat show host was last night rumoured to have compered the evening reception.

The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

Some even believed the space in front of the Queen was left empty for Princess DianaThen there was the bridal bouquet of forget-me-nots — the Princess’s favourite — that Harry hand-picked from the walled garden at Nottingham Cottage, his home at Kensington Palace.The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is the founder of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/00/4C6DE1E800000578-5751563-image-a-5_1526860191218.jpg","title":"Copy blue number worn Meghans best friend Miss Mulroney available online 1 000","story":"    A pop-up collection by Di Carlo Couture went live on the morning of the wedding with the ‘Jessica’ dress – a replica of Miss Mulroney’s form-fitting number, available to purchase for £1,100Her seven-year-old twin boys Brian and John played a key part in the wedding ceremony, carrying the bride’s train.But mother Jessica Mulroney appears to be carving out a starring role of her own.While the 37-year-old Canadian mother-of-three, who is Meghan’s best friend and closest confidante, was circumspect online, the style guru and her outfits were plastered over social media by her associates.The PR consultant and bridal expert, who has been dubbed Toronto’s Gwyneth Paltrow, met Meghan when the actress moved to the city to film US legal drama Suits and the pair bonded over a love of yoga.Over the weekend Instagram addict Miss Mulroney posted just a single photograph on her Instagram account – a picture of her twins holding Meghan’s train as she walked up the steps of St George’s Chapel on Saturday. ‘Proud friend.

They are not only the dress for the bride\u0027s most special day, but they also need to say something about the time and the nation of which they are a part.

A bi-racial, American actress marrying into the British Royal Family. Her groom was the much-loved second son of the late Princess of Wales, a man whom the nation clasped to its heart from the moment he took the long walk behind his mother\u0027s coffin at her funeral. His bride was going to have a tough job living up to our expectations of the woman he should marry.A very modern marriage: Harry and Meghan wed at St George\u0027s...Share this articleWhere the dress was such a master stroke was that it not only demonstrated Meghan\u0027s taste and style, but it wove an assured path through many potential pitfalls.For a start, she didn\u0027t stumble at the bling hurdle.There were many who\u0027d assumed that, as an actress used to the paparazzi flashbulbs, Meghan would opt for something more Hollywood princess, a confection that would sparkle like a thousand stars in the May sunshine.  Meghan wore a £200K creation by Givenchy to marry Prince Harry. The bride-to-be reportedly commissioned Givenchy\u0027s Clare Waight Keller after viewing sketches with her best friend Jessica Mulroney How wrong that would have been. For she is not a twentysomething Barbie doll, but a woman who wishes to be taken seriously in her desires to make the world a fairer, more inclusive place.In today\u0027s world of trial by social media, anything seen as too ostentatious would have been pilloried within seconds.With her minimalist gown of pure white matte silk cady — three-quarter-length sleeves showing off a classically elegant Cartier bracelet, the companion to her small diamond Cartier earrings — she also navigated a wise distance from the wedding dress of her new sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge.          Sketches of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s wedding dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller          In today\u0027s world of trial by social media, anything seen as too ostentatious would have been pilloried within secondsThat exquisite dress was laden with heritage and symbolism, every centimetre a demonstration of the brilliance of British craftsmanship and design. A dress that transformed Kate Middleton into Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.Meghan\u0027s dress achieved something entirely different.The beautifully sculpted neckline exposed just the right amount of bare, freckled collarbone, letting nothing distract from Queen Mary\u0027s incredible diamond bandeau tiara pinned into the bride\u0027s chignon.The seamless bodice decorously encasing her slim torso and the unadorned full skirt were ideal foils for the veil, where embroidery depicting flowers of the 53 Commonwealth countries, as well as the Californian poppy and wintersweet from the Kensington Palace garden, announced Meghan\u0027s intentions to be a globally aware royal.This dress enhanced the Meghan-ness of the new Duchess, rather than transforming her into someone else. And rightly so.Brand Meghan has been finely honed in a contemporary world where such things matter. She has spent many years building up a career and a profile that embrace inclusivity and equality, becoming a charismatic speaker and an ambassador for her causes.Her beauty, natural sexiness and ease of communication have all been harnessed to that end, and her long hair, big smile and seeming confidence are as much part of her brand as her work.Add to that the glamour and experience in the public eye associated with being a TV actress and you have star power. And that was before she became a royal.          Clare Waight Keller, designer at Givenchy, gives an interview the day after Meghan Markle walked down the aisle          The relationship between designer and bride needs to be one of trust and supportThe dress, like every detail of the ceremony and every word spoken, would have been conceived with the desire to demonstrate the personal values of a highly successful modern woman intent on being judged on her own terms.So perhaps her choice of designer should have been less of a surprise. Clare Waight Keller, the first female artistic director of Givenchy, is also a determined, high-achieving woman. During my tenure as editor-in-chief of British Vogue, I saw her rise through the fashion hierarchy to head up one of Paris fashion\u0027s most famous houses.This British graduate of the prestigious Royal College of Art worked her way up through many of fashion\u0027s largest brands, including Calvin Klein and Gucci, getting her first lead role in the knitwear company Pringle of Scotland.With her loose, tawny hair and fresh, natural style, Clare has a low-key manner that belies her strength and steel.A married mother-of-three, she and her husband decided to move their family to Paris when she was hired to head up luxury label Chloe in 2011 and she has triumphed in a city whose fashion community is notoriously judgmental and not always welcoming to foreigners.The relationship between designer and bride needs to be one of trust and support. During the process of fitting the dress, the designer sees you at your most exposed, pinning the toile while you stand there in just your underwear.It is probably no accident that, like the Duchess of Cambridge before her, Meghan chose a label where a woman had recently taken over the helm, who might naturally be more empathetic to the emotions any bride experiences.  The beaming bride opted for classic simplicity for her dress design, which has been widely praised by other bridal designers and fashion experts           Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage told Femail that a dress like Meghan\u0027s is likely to cost in the region of £200,000                        "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/05/19/12/2018/05/19/11/video-3018102-481_154x115.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan funk classic Land 1 000 Dances","story":"   Coaches ferried Meghan’s Hollywood pals from the cast of Suits, who had been staying at the five-star Coworth Park hotel in nearby Ascot, en masse to the venue.Despite a reported ban on mobile phones inside Frogmore, many still managed to sneak pictures and videos online.Meghan’s friend, tennis ace Serena Williams, shared not one but three photographs of herself posing in the grounds in a flamboyant black and floral Valentino gown, while stylist Jessica Mulroney – whose twin sons had carried Meghan’s train earlier in the day – was pictured wearing a £6,000 low-cut gold beaded dress by Indian designer Naeem Khan.US actress Troian Bellisario, 32, shared giddy videos of herself and fellow actresses Abigail Spencer and Sarah Rafferty getting off the coach and swapping their designer stilettos for comfortable slippers provided by the bride.‘How amazing is this?’ she can be heard saying in one of the videos. ‘These shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. Slippers!’Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of ‘spring meets summer’. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles’s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for ‘navigating everything with such grace’ after a turbulent week. ‘We make such a great team,’ he said. ‘I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.’Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie’s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry’s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for ‘punching above his weight’. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a ‘round the world’ bar, whose top offering was the ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom’s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman’s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced ‘furiously’ to the DJ’s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa’s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to ‘avoid cheese’ and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ’d in some of the world’s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn’t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself ‘the country’s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band’. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye’s How Sweet It Is and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor’s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds’ first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan’s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry’s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/12/4C6C339600000578-0-image-m-54_1526730200824.jpg","title":"Ex student 25 conned extreme explorers 500 000","story":"    The sister of Former Birmingham student Jesse Gordon, pictured centre at a cattle market in Darfur, told The Times he changed his name in 2014 to William Baekeland and claimed he was the great-grand son of the inventor of Bakelite           Baekeland is accused of charging £525,000 to a group of extreme travellers by receiving cash from them to arrange trips to obscure places which have not taken placeHe legally changed his name from Gordon to Baekeland in 2014.  According to Rolling Stone magazine, Baekeland introduced himself to a group of intrepid travellers on board a ship called the Ortelius in March 2015 which was en-route to a tiny Norwegian territory called Bouvet Island, which is located between Antarctica and South Africa.The uninhabited island is about 1,500 miles south of Cape Town.  Watch robbers who terrified their victims with a stun gun...Man, 36, appears in court charged with murdering \u0027gentle and...Share this articleWitnesses reportedly said Baekeland had wooed those on the voyage and soon began wiring him large amounts of cash to arrange other extreme trips.The young man, who was 22 at the time, was described by fellow travellers as \u0027a throwback to David Livingstone\u0027. Over the next two years, Baekeland allegedly convinced several of the group to hand over approximately £525,000 for future trips, only some of which actually took place.            Baekeland\u0027s sister Jasmine Gordon said her brother was alway interested in geographyAccording to The Times,  Baekeland had not left Britain until he was aged 15 when he went on a Scout camp to Canada.  His sister Jasmine Gordon revealed: \u0027Our parents are normal working-class people, we are not particularly wealthy.

He has a 75-per cent disapproval rating.Maduro\u0027s main challenger is former state Governor Henri Falcon, who predicted an upset because of fury among Venezuela\u0027s 30 million people at their increased poverty.Although some opinion polls have shown Falcon ahead, analysts say his chances are thin, given widespread abstention, the vote-winning power of state handouts and Maduro\u0027s allies on the election board.Results were expected by late evening.In voting stations visited by Reuters reporters, from wealthy east Caracas to the Andean mountains near Colombia, attendance appeared far lower than the last presidential election in 2013 when there was an 80 per cent turnout.The Democratic Unity coalition, which was boycotting the vote, estimated turnout at 25.8 percent by 1pm EDT  based on its own quick count estimates.There were lines, however, outside some polling stations in poorer government strongholds, where the majority of voters interviewed said they were backing Maduro.\u0027I\u0027m hungry and don\u0027t have a job, but I\u0027m sticking to Maduro,\u0027 said Carlos Rincones, 49, in the once-thriving industrial city of Valencia, accusing right-wing business owners of purposefully hiding food and hiking prices.  Maduro\u0027s main challenger is former state Governor Henri Falcon arrives for a campaign rally in Barquisimeto, Venezuela on May 17The government has set up so-called red point zones near polling stations so Venezuelans can scan their state-issued \u0027fatherland cards\u0027 used to receive benefits including food boxes and money transfers. Maduro has promised a \u0027prize\u0027 to those who do so. Critics say that is a way of scaring impoverished Venezuelans into supporting his government.Falcon\u0027s team said it received about 900 complaints about the \u0027red points.\u0027 Several state workers also told Reuters they were pressured to vote, while pro-government activists hovered around some polling stations, saying they were assisting voters.Further hurting Falcon\u0027s chances by splitting the anti-Maduro vote was a third candidate, evangelical pastor Javier Bertucci, who has picked up quite a following, not least thanks to his free soup handouts.Many Venezuelans are disillusioned and angry over the election: They criticize Maduro for economic hardships and the opposition for its dysfunctional splits.Reeling from a fifth year of recession, falling oil production and U.S. sanctions, Venezuela is seeing growing levels of malnutrition, hyperinflation, and mass emigration.\u0027I think this constant aggression from the government of the Ku Klux Klan is losing credibility,\u0027 Maduro said on Sunday, blaming U.S. President Donald Trump\u0027s administration for Venezuela\u0027s mess.Venezuelan migrants staged small anti-Maduro protests in cities from Madrid to Miami. In the highland city of San Cristobal near Colombia, three cloth dolls representing widely loathed officials - Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena, Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello and Vice President Tareck El Aissami - were hung from a footbridge.But streets were calm, with kids playing soccer on one road in San Cristobal blocked off at past elections to accommodate long voter lines. For many Venezuelans, Sunday was a day to look for scant food or stock up on water, which is increasingly running short because of years of underinvestment.\u0027I\u0027m not voting - what\u0027s the point if we already know the result? I prefer to come here to get water rather than waste my time,\u0027 said Raul Sanchez, filling a jug from a tap by a busy road in the arid north-western city of Punto Fijo because his community has not had running water for 26 days.  Voters line up at a polling station during the presidential election in Barquisimeto, Venezuela on SundayIn what the opposition said was a bid to legitimize Maduro\u0027s coming victory, state television urged Venezuelans to vote and Maduro announced transport to polling centers would be \u0027facilitated.\u0027Some opposition supporters say the boycott only made life easier for Maduro and that his rivals should have fought him at the ballot box despite an unfair playing ground.\u0027I\u0027m voting because the opposition doesn\u0027t have any proposals for what we\u0027re going to do when Maduro wins today. I want this nightmare to stop,\u0027 said teacher Luisa Marquez, 56, in Valencia.Should Maduro win, he may choose to deepen a successful purge of critics within the ruling \u0027Chavismo\u0027 movement.Abroad, Maduro is likely to face further Western protests should he win, although Russia and China remain allies and have been important financial backers.Maduro faces a Herculean task to turn around the moribund economy, with the bolivar currency down 99 per cent in the last year and inflation at an annual 14,000 per cent, according to the National Assembly. Multinational corporations have also been departing or minimizing operations in

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.Sore heads? Wills and Kate cover their eyes with sunglasses...George who-ney? Police keep actor and his wife waiting for...Share this articleAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter’s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"    The 39-year-old British actor-cum-US chat show host was last night rumoured to have compered the evening reception.

The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is the founder of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/00/4C6DE1E800000578-5751563-image-a-5_1526860191218.jpg","title":"Copy blue number worn Meghans best friend Miss Mulroney available online 1 000","story":"    A pop-up collection by Di Carlo Couture went live on the morning of the wedding with the ‘Jessica’ dress – a replica of Miss Mulroney’s form-fitting number, available to purchase for £1,100Her seven-year-old twin boys Brian and John played a key part in the wedding ceremony, carrying the bride’s train.But mother Jessica Mulroney appears to be carving out a starring role of her own.While the 37-year-old Canadian mother-of-three, who is Meghan’s best friend and closest confidante, was circumspect online, the style guru and her outfits were plastered over social media by her associates.The PR consultant and bridal expert, who has been dubbed Toronto’s Gwyneth Paltrow, met Meghan when the actress moved to the city to film US legal drama Suits and the pair bonded over a love of yoga.Over the weekend Instagram addict Miss Mulroney posted just a single photograph on her Instagram account – a picture of her twins holding Meghan’s train as she walked up the steps of St George’s Chapel on Saturday. ‘Proud friend.

Givenchy? Isn\u0027t that a French fashion house? So unexpected was the choice, there weren\u0027t even any odds on it at the bookies.What was not unexpected, however, was that every detail of the dress demonstrated Meghan\u0027s genius in the art of using herself as a powerful, beautiful and captivating billboard to get across the ideas she wants to convey.And that is what royal wedding dresses have always had to achieve. They are not only the dress for the bride\u0027s most special day, but they also need to say something about the time and the nation of which they are a part.    Meghan\u0027s veil is five meters long and made from silk tulle with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organzaMeghan Markle was a 36-year-old second-time bride. A bi-racial, American actress marrying into the British Royal Family. Her groom was the much-loved second son of the late Princess of Wales, a man whom the nation clasped to its heart from the moment he took the long walk behind his mother\u0027s coffin at her funeral. His bride was going to have a tough job living up to our expectations of the woman he should marry.A very modern marriage: Harry and Meghan wed at St George\u0027s...Share this articleWhere the dress was such a master stroke was that it not only demonstrated Meghan\u0027s taste and style, but it wove an assured path through many potential pitfalls.For a start, she didn\u0027t stumble at the bling hurdle.There were many who\u0027d assumed that, as an actress used to the paparazzi flashbulbs, Meghan would opt for something more Hollywood princess, a confection that would sparkle like a thousand stars in the May sunshine.  Meghan wore a £200K creation by Givenchy to marry Prince Harry. The bride-to-be reportedly commissioned Givenchy\u0027s Clare Waight Keller after viewing sketches with her best friend Jessica Mulroney How wrong that would have been. For she is not a twentysomething Barbie doll, but a woman who wishes to be taken seriously in her desires to make the world a fairer, more inclusive place.In today\u0027s world of trial by social media, anything seen as too ostentatious would have been pilloried within seconds.With her minimalist gown of pure white matte silk cady — three-quarter-length sleeves showing off a classically elegant Cartier bracelet, the companion to her small diamond Cartier earrings — she also navigated a wise distance from the wedding dress of her new sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge.          Sketches of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s wedding dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller          In today\u0027s world of trial by social media, anything seen as too ostentatious would have been pilloried within secondsThat exquisite dress was laden with heritage and symbolism, every centimetre a demonstration of the brilliance of British craftsmanship and design. A dress that transformed Kate Middleton into Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.Meghan\u0027s dress achieved something entirely different.The beautifully sculpted neckline exposed just the right amount of bare, freckled collarbone, letting nothing distract from Queen Mary\u0027s incredible diamond bandeau tiara pinned into the bride\u0027s chignon.The seamless bodice decorously encasing her slim torso and the unadorned full skirt were ideal foils for the veil, where embroidery depicting flowers of the 53 Commonwealth countries, as well as the Californian poppy and wintersweet from the Kensington Palace garden, announced Meghan\u0027s intentions to be a globally aware royal.This dress enhanced the Meghan-ness of the new Duchess, rather than transforming her into someone else. And rightly so.Brand Meghan has been finely honed in a contemporary world where such things matter. She has spent many years building up a career and a profile that embrace inclusivity and equality, becoming a charismatic speaker and an ambassador for her causes.Her beauty, natural sexiness and ease of communication have all been harnessed to that end, and her long hair, big smile and seeming confidence are as much part of her brand as her work.Add to that the glamour and experience in the public eye associated with being a TV actress and you have star power. And that was before she became a royal.          Clare Waight Keller, designer at Givenchy, gives an interview the day after Meghan Markle walked down the aisle          The relationship between designer and bride needs to be one of trust and supportThe dress, like every detail of the ceremony and every word spoken, would have been conceived with the desire to demonstrate the personal values of a highly successful modern woman intent on being judged on her own terms.So perhaps her choice of designer should have been less of a surprise. Clare Waight Keller, the first female artistic director of Givenchy, is also a determined, high-achieving woman. During my tenure as editor-in-chief of British Vogue, I saw her rise through the fashion hierarchy to head up one of Paris fashion\u0027s most famous houses.This British graduate of the prestigious Royal College of Art worked her way up through many of fashion\u0027s largest brands, including Calvin Klein and Gucci, getting her first lead role in the knitwear company Pringle of Scotland.With her loose, tawny hair and fresh, natural style, Clare has a low-key manner that belies her strength and steel.A married mother-of-three, she and her husband decided to move their family to Paris when she was hired to head up luxury label Chloe in 2011 and she has triumphed in a city whose fashion community is notoriously judgmental and not always welcoming to foreigners.The relationship between designer and bride needs to be one of trust and support. During the process of fitting the dress, the designer sees you at your most exposed, pinning the toile while you stand there in just your underwear.It is probably no accident that, like the Duchess of Cambridge before her, Meghan chose a label where a woman had recently taken over the helm, who might naturally be more empathetic to the emotions any bride experiences.  The beaming bride opted for classic simplicity for her dress design, which has been widely praised by other bridal designers and fashion experts           Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage told Femail that a dress like Meghan\u0027s is likely to cost in the region of £200,000                        "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/05/19/12/2018/05/19/11/video-3018102-481_154x115.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan funk classic Land 1 000 Dances","story":"   Coaches ferried Meghan’s Hollywood pals from the cast of Suits, who had been staying at the five-star Coworth Park hotel in nearby Ascot, en masse to the venue.Despite a reported ban on mobile phones inside Frogmore, many still managed to sneak pictures and videos online.Meghan’s friend, tennis ace Serena Williams, shared not one but three photographs of herself posing in the grounds in a flamboyant black and floral Valentino gown, while stylist Jessica Mulroney – whose twin sons had carried Meghan’s train earlier in the day – was pictured wearing a £6,000 low-cut gold beaded dress by Indian designer Naeem Khan.US actress Troian Bellisario, 32, shared giddy videos of herself and fellow actresses Abigail Spencer and Sarah Rafferty getting off the coach and swapping their designer stilettos for comfortable slippers provided by the bride.‘How amazing is this?’ she can be heard saying in one of the videos. ‘These shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. Slippers!’Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of ‘spring meets summer’. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles’s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for ‘navigating everything with such grace’ after a turbulent week. ‘We make such a great team,’ he said. ‘I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.’Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie’s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry’s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for ‘punching above his weight’. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a ‘round the world’ bar, whose top offering was the ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom’s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman’s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced ‘furiously’ to the DJ’s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa’s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to ‘avoid cheese’ and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ’d in some of the world’s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn’t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself ‘the country’s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band’. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye’s How Sweet It Is and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor’s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds’ first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan’s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry’s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/07/4C7D1BD800000578-5752281-image-a-2_1526884334419.jpg","title":"Cheeky guests caught trying flog Royal Wedding gift bag eBay 400","story":"    Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Dozens of the so-called Community Champions started auctioning these free gifts off to the highest bidder.Many had clearly planned to do it and photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel.    MailOnline has found at least 25 listings ranging from between £25 and £420. So why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

It has already closed 20, affecting about 900 jobs, but staff are braced for the axe to fall on another tranche of stores before the announcement of its annual results on Wednesday.The closures are part of a plan announced 18 months ago to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its ailing clothing ranges. Initially, just 30 out of a group of 105 underperforming stores were to shut but Rowe has decided on a more aggressive closure plan as sales move online.After several years of disappointing financial results, the restructuring at M\u0026ampS has entered a more radical phase since Archie Norman was installed as chairman. There have been a number of casualties in the boardroom including Andy Adcock, the boss of its upmarket food halls, who has been replaced, and marketing chief Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne.When the company updated investors six months ago, Norman was frank about the scale of its problems. M\u0026ampS had been “drifting” for more than 15 years, he said, as he promised to speed up store changes and tackle its misfiring food business.Rowe has been in charge for two years but, with no green shoots to celebrate and a backdrop of weak consumer spending, M\u0026ampS’s share price has fallen by nearly a quarter over the past year. The decline means the 134-year-old retailer’s place in the prestigious FTSE 100 could now be in jeopardy. M\u0026ampS has been a member of the blue chip index since its inception in 1984 but could be relegated to the FTSE 250 in a stock exchange reshuffle this week. Relegation would be a symbolic moment for the British institution that has struggled to hang on to shoppers in a digital age.Ocado, the online grocer, and Asos, the fashion website, are now worth more than M\u0026ampS in market value terms in a sign of the sea change in shopping habits. Ocado surged past M\u0026ampS on Thursday after it struck a major deal with US supermarket chain Kroger.Rowe will flag price cuts this week in the food and clothing aisles as M\u0026ampS attempts to fight back against the growth of value chains such as Primark, Aldi and Lidl. He will also announce investment in the warehousing needed to support the growth of its website.Shore Capital analyst Clive Black predicted an improving trend in clothing sales but felt that the food business had fared less well. “It’s the perpetual conundrum of M\u0026ampS,” he said. “Can it get the stars aligned and both businesses growing at the same time? Not yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afbc0053e8755e0e36c28f510c44764f7af5d382/0_289_4426_2656/master/4426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5375e199647dc70407c784e534ed0336","title":"new starbucks policy allows nonpaying guests use restrooms","story":"Move comes after company was accused of bias when two black men were arrested for sitting without ordering anything Starbucks has told its employees to allow all guests to use store facilities, including restrooms, regardless of their spending.The move comes a month after the coffee giant found itself accused of discriminatory practices, after a store manager in Philadelphia called the police  on two black men who asked to use the bathroom without purchasing anything and then refused to leave. The new policy was announced on Saturday in a company-wide letter that stated: “Any person who enters our spaces, including patios, cafes and restrooms, regardless of whether they make a purchase, is considered a customer.”Previously, Starbucks employees had been free to exercise judgment about nonpaying guests. The company said the new policy would apply to its more than 8,000 company-operated US cafes. It would issue different guidelines for its international stores, it said.The Philadelphia store involved in the 12 April incident had signs informing visitors that the bathrooms were for paying customers only. After the police were called on Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, the men were arrested and spent hours in jail.They were not charged and later reached settlements that included a nominal financial sum and “a commitment to continued listening and dialogue between the parties as a means toward developing specific actions and opportunities”. “I want to thank Donte and Rashon for their willingness to reconcile,” said Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson, announcing the settlement. “Starbucks will continue to take actions that stem from this incident to repair and reaffirm our values and vision for the kind of company we want to be.” The chain plans to close its company-operated stores next Sunday afternoon, to give employees anti-bias training. In 2015, Starbucks initiated a program to encourage employees to discuss race with customers. The directive was quickly dropped.

I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb107c33c4ddb41859e889c403c4e6e671132a79/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b22cf6cac0b5c437eddc85477ce077d8","title":"bishop michael curry sermon history harry meghan wedding","story":"The candle flames were trembling. The pulpit was on fire. The bride and groom were waiting. As were the Queen, Oprah, Idris Elba, and Doria Ragland, now the world’s most famous yoga teacher. Just before he got on to the subject of fire, Bishop Michael Curry, the first African-American leader of the US Episcopal church, promised the happy couple, “and with this I’ll sit down, we got to get y’all married”. But there’s a lot to say about the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and his relevance to modern technology and the concept of love and how this relates to Martin Luther King, so he went on for another three minutes.Curry’s sermon was one of three moments during the royal wedding when I felt moved. I had not expected to be moved. I had expected to remain full of cold indignation at the pomp and aristocratic indulgence of the day, at the preparatory shooing of the homeless off the streets of Windsor by police officers who should be tending to more important things like knife crime, at the £32m shamelessly spent amid the rising presence of foodbanks and child poverty. The first of these moments was Ragland arriving at the chapel, a black woman quietly alone, being assisted from her car by a representative of an institution that had partaken in her oppression and was now required to respect her. The other was the Kingdom Choir’s beautiful rendition of Stand By Me, in part because it followed the sermon.Reading from his iPad, gesticulating, swinging his robes, smiling, rocking back and forth on his feet, Curry was in complete contrast to the solemn and stationary ecclesiastical address that preceded his. Where there was stillness, now there was movement. For 14 minutes he preached in the full-throated, uninhibited, theatrical and emotive style of the traditional African-American church. He preached of Moses and Jesus of Nazareth, the Hebrew scriptures and the “old slaves in America’s antebellum South” who recognised in their singing of spirituals, “even in the midst of their captivity”, that there is “a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole”. Quoting from Martin Luther King to begin and end the speech, this was not something ever witnessed within the lofty walls of the pinnacle of the Anglican establishment at a royal wedding. This was a speech that could have been lifted straight out of the pages of James Baldwin or ZZ Packer.An ardent campaigner for social justice, particularly on immigration and same-sex marriage, Chicago-born Curry, himself a descendent of slaves, did not tone down his passionate message of the social and political power of love in order to align with the reserve of his pale and stately onlookers. He did not filter. He did it black, with music in his arms, and rhythm in his voice, and a looseness and openness in his face that supposed an almost familial acquaintance with his audience.In his world, words do not travel alone from the mouth, with just their letters and their grammar for company. Here the body comes too, giving life to the words, lifting them into the air to float and dance into comprehension and human feeling. For Zara Tindall, captured open-mouthed in her pricey, shiny teal in the pews, it was something to behold.The expressions on the faces of the congregation around the church were also something to behold, ranging from empathy to bemusement to confusion to downright scorn. Four minutes in, Camilla Parker Bowles’s ludicrous hat was trembling as she held down her head: was she laughing? Prince Charles was also bowed, red around the ears, more so than usual: was he?There was half a smirk at the Duchess of Cambridge’s mouth, and, when Curry exclaimed: “Oh that’s the balm in Gilead!”, throwing up his hands in emphasis, the Queen straightened in her chair, purse-lipped. Meanwhile, Oprah swayed. Ragland looked steadily on, a little sadly, as if aware of something of which others were not, yet also with an innate sweetness while her daughter sat holding hands with her prince, occasionally conferring in love-soaked whispers.It was a sermon that will go down in history as a moment when the enduring seat of colonialism was brought before the Lord, and questioned in its own house. In the mention of slavery was the inherent accusation of white silver-spoon complicity, and that this union should not go forth without acknowledging it.“Love is the way,” Curry chanted, in a rolling, conversational repetition borne of the deep south. “When love is the way, we actually treat each other, well” – he put his hand on his hip and his elbow on the lectern – “like we are actually a family.” A utopia for our time indeed, delivered with a grand humility apparently wasted on some of its listeners, who were not quite expecting such blackness from a black bride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5f972c2f51ce67f593c36689177c495d430120/0_156_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65c2e94754a5a5e30cefd62a01fe47e3","title":"spirit britain royal wedding brexit","story":"The rest of the world is baffled by Britain – and understandably so. In the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, directed by Danny Boyle, we dramatised a confidence, openness and multiplicity that only a nation at ease with itself could muster. The global “soft power” of our language, cultural and scientific institutions, and international development programmes – still ringfenced by the Treasury – remains formidable. And on Saturday, hundreds of millions around the world watched the royal wedding: as glorious a fusion of pageantry and pluralism, of monarchy and modernity, as you could hope for.Yet this spirit of generous self-assurance has its evil twin. We are also the country of Brexit of Nigel Farage of Jacob Rees-Mogg posing outside No 10 to deliver a petition demanding cuts to the aid budget and, most recently and shamefully, of the Windrush scandal.Which is the authentic Britain? Open or closed? Warm or frostily parochial? Both, I suppose. Most countries are, to use a word much-loved by Nick Clegg, “bicephalous”: two-headed and contradictory. The question we should ask in 2018 is: which of the two heads dominates?On my travels in the past year, I have encountered understandable confusion about our national trajectory. To crunch a complex series of perceptions into a seriously oversimplified narrative, the view from beyond our shores runs as follows: Britain was in terrible shape in 1979. Margaret Thatcher’s shock therapy, painful for a great many, laid the foundations of renewed national prosperity. Labour’s election in 1997 marked a determination to match economic growth with social justice and liberalism.According to this happy version of events, the 2012 Olympics represented the culmination of more than three decades of regenerative work: a global festival in which Britain declared itself to be both open for business and open in spirit. Into which narrative, the rusty ner of Brexit was thrown with clanking ferocity four years later. Suddenly, Britain was declaring its furious hostility to “mass immigration”, to its putative imprisonment as a “vassal state”, to the supposed\u0026nbspmutilation of its island heritage. Optimism had yielded to fear. We were, to quote Nigel Farage’s vile poster, at\u0026nbsp“breaking point”. You can forgive the rest of the world its perplexity. When, exactly, did Britain decide angry nativism was the way forward?This global confusion about who we are and what we want has profoundly practical consequences. Ask any senior diplomat or chief executive and they will tell you the same thing: namely, that technical detail forms the structure of any deal, alliance or treaty, but that the much more nebulous question of culture, shared ideals and emotional identity determines the foundation. Trade agreements and investment decisions are not decided by algorithm alone. Each side must ask: what sort of partner am I aligning myself with? Will my employees be heading towards an outstretched hand or a “hostile environment”?If I had to single out the principal cause of our national identity crisis, I would cite the catastrophic absence of leadership on immigration policy. The issue has maddened us, unnecessarily and tragically. It has drained much of our national confidence, made us mean, bred an uncharitable insularity.In their words, deeds and tactical silences, politicians of both main parties have allowed a series of myths to enter and settle into mainstream discourse: that migrants depress wages and take jobs from indigenous citizens that migrants are a drain on the taxpayer that only the “metropolitan elite” benefits from migrant labour that migrants are more likely to commit crimes. All this is rubbish, and deserves to be robustly and repeatedly dismissed as such – not left to fester in the national consciousness. I also believe immigration is culturally enriching. But then I have skin in the game (the surname is a clue). So let us concentrate on economic necessity.A familiar refrain of pro-Brexit MPs is that their constituents were somehow “not consulted” on recent immigration. To which the only answer should be: oh yes they were. They were consulted when they voted repeatedly for an NHS that has the capacity to treat them – an objective that would be unthinkable without migrant labour.They made a decision in favour of immigration when they opted for low-price consumer goods, for rapid delivery services, for facilities and shops that are open around the clock. They chose. We all did. It is outrageous hypocrisy to pretend otherwise.In cabinet, I am told, even the arch-Brexiteers declare that national prosperity should not be sacrificed to the achievement of arbitrarily low net migration targets. Well, thanks a lot. Now they spot the flaw in the plan.To be fair to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, he has repeatedly conceded that immigration policy post-Brexit will require many exemptions to meet the needs of the labour market. And as for all those shiny trade deals we are promised after 29 March 2019: the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, told a Commons committee in February that visas could “absolutely” be exchanged for commercial access in future negotiations.Brexit encapsulates this cognitive dissonance and its damaging consequences: it is about much more than our institutional relationship with the EU. I long for political leaders with the courage and candour to declare that the great challenges facing this country – automation, fiscal fairness, entrenched poverty, human longevity – have nothing to do with immigration, race or the much-needed influx of newcomers. That it has taken a royal wedding to reinstate this straightforward truth should shame our drab political class."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef0713823bc906a91949735cd2f2ba4d338afdac/0_111_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94792a988e43908e8a7992a432ff3039","title":"the guardian view on the grenfell tower inquiry necessary but not sufficient","story":"The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire finally begins this week with a fortnight of testimony from friends and relatives of the 71 people who died in the terrible blaze on the night of 14 June 2018. The blackened shell of the 24-storey tower has become a symbol of the inequalities of Britain. Almost a year on, there remains a disturbing feeling that justice is far from being delivered. The families of the dead are a long way from possessing any sense of completion. The inquiry, led by a judge, is a necessary step, but it is far from being a sufficient one.The government has yet to make much progress on the houses that the former Grenfell residents need – only one in three of the families are living in a permanent new home. Woeful handling of the situation by Kensington and Chelsea council has not improved much since it dumped its ineffective leadership last year, bringing in a new head who’d never been to a tower block. Unsurprisingly the council continues to build fewer affordable homes than any other London borough.Justice must also been seen to be done. Many fear that ministers will never fully hold to account those culpable, shying away from taking on vested interests in the building industry. This dread deepened last week when mixed signals were sent over whether the use of combustible materials to clad high-rise buildings would be banned. In the case of Grenfell the “cladding” consisted of aluminium sheets fixed to a quarter-inch core of polyethylene, a material so flammable it is compared to petrol. Australia had a high-rise fire in 2014 it now has a ban on unsafe cladding. Dubai had one in 2015 it has a ban on high-risk materials. More than 300 tower blocks in the UK are wrapped in similiar dangerous cladding. It seems obvious that Britain must do the same.It was bewildering that last week’s official review of building regulations, commissioned by the government, did not prohibit the use of combustible materials. The report’s author, Dame Judith Hackitt, told the BBC on Thursday morning that she didn’t think a ban would work. This was contradicted by James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, who told MPs he would consult on a ban, but not implement one immediately. His defence was that the cladding on Grenfell Tower was unlawful under existing building rules and should not have been used. If that is the case then why are the guilty parties not being tracked down now and held to account? Ministers cannot hide behind public inquiries.It seems clear that official guidance was drafted to be vague enough to convince parts of the industry that a material that was unsafe was legal. Yet prominent Conservatives since 2010 missed chances to tighten up regulations. Gavin Barwell, the then housing minister (now Downing Street chief of staff), did not take the opportunity offered by a coroner’s inquest after a fire in a 14-storey block where six people died. He neglected to uncover the dangers of cladding materials in a review of guidelines. Brandon Lewis, now party chairman, said he wanted to “exhaust all non-regulatory options before we introduce new regulations” when it was recommended that tall buildings were retrofitted with sprinklers. An Inside Housing investigation uncovered a 30-year obsession\u0026nbspwith deregulation. This fixation meant that warning signs of disaster seem to have been missed on this government’s watch. An ideological compass can be a guide to action. But it pointed in the wrong direction over Grenfell Tower. Public safety needs rules that are prescriptive. Lives will be lost if ministers get this wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b611449a1227eaaa4ece9443d720da9fc692a42/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d64f8414a898b311368b432428b008","title":"big tech products silicon valley","story":"It’s years since Silicon Valley gave us a game-changer. Instead, from curing disease to colonies on Mars, we’re fed overblown promisesBack in 1999, Google hit 1bn searches a year. Wifi began to make an impact about two years later. Thanks to the pioneers of Facebook and Twitter, the age of mass social media dawned between 2004 and 2006 – and non-stop posting, messaging and following was soon enabled by the iPhone, launched in 2007. These things have changed the world and, in hindsight, the way they became ubiquitous had a powerful sense of inevitability. But the revolution they represented is old now, and nothing comparable has come along for more than a decade.Despite this, a regular ritual of hype and hysteria is now built into the news cycle. Every now and again, at some huge auditorium, a senior staff member at one of the big firms based in northern California – ordinarily a man – will take the stage dressed in box-fresh casualwear, and inform the gathered multitudes of some hitherto unimagined leap forward, supposedly destined to transform millions of lives. (There will be whoops and gasps in response, and a splurge of media coverage – before, in the wider world, a palpable feeling of anticlimax sets in.)It happened again a fortnight ago, when the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, addressed his company’s annual developers’ conference. Among his other tasks, he was there to rhapsodise about developments in artificial intelligence, and the ever-evolving application known as Google Assistant (created, he said, to “help you get things done”), and a new innovation called Duplex. “It turns out that a big part of getting things done is making a phone call,” he said. He then mentioned getting an appointment for a haircut: “You know, we’re working hard to get users through those moments.”The screens behind him lit up, and the sound system played a synthesised female voice, whose words were punctuated with authentic-sounding umms and aahs. The voice conversed with a human being at the other end of a phone line, who apparently had no idea she was talking to a machine, and the software seemed to quickly and seamlessly secure a 10am appointment. Pockets of the crowd went into raptures. “That was a real call you just heard,” said Pichai. “The amazing thing is, our Assistant can actually understand the nuances of conversation.”Now, when was the last time you came to book a haircut or restaurant table and concluded that the task was so onerous that you would ideally delegate it to a machine? And even if you can easily think of a scenario, would there not be something ethically questionable about doing so, if the person at the other end had no idea who or what they were talking to? In fact, might Duplex be a grim portal into a future in which high-flyers get digital “assistants” to do their chores, while poorly paid people have to meekly talk to computers, in constant fear that they are about to be automated into joblessness?Pichai also announced the introduction of a new feature of Gmail called Smart Compose: a kind of supercharged predictive text that offers you extended phrases as you type, which then build up into whole sentences. (To quote one report, the software will “tailor its predictions to each inidual user, based … on information that Google already knows about you”.) Pichai showed an email exchange in which Smart Compose understood that the matter at hand was “Taco Tuesday”, and suggested “chips, salsa, and guacamole”. Hearing more whoops of delight from the audience, I thought about a vision of the near future in which half the human race will converse in preordained cliches.The endless noise emanating from Silicon Valley essentially has two complementary elements. One is all about dreams so unlikely that they beggar belief: the idea that the Tesla CEO Elon Musk will one day set up a colony on Mars or that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg can successfully marshal an attempt to “cure, prevent and manage” all diseases in a single generation. Whatever its basis in fact, this stuff casts people and corporations as godlike visionaries, and then provides a puffed-up context for the stuff the big tech companies shout about week in, week out: stuff we either don’t need or, worse, which threatens some of the basic aspects of everyday\u0026nbspcivilisation.Our phones are full of apps that gather digital dust, and the same fate has befallen many supposedly groundbreaking inventions. Though the idea of internet-enabled spectacles has potentially fascinating uses in such fields as autism, education and high-end manufacturing, Google Glass was never going to be a mass-market product in the way its inventors thought.Yet some people fall in love with these things. Among the great mountain of writing at the heart of the current so-called “techlash” is a great book entitled Radical Technologies, by the former tech insider Adam Greenfield. When he writes about people obsessed with the kind of internet-enabled devices that monitor sleep, heart rates and exercise levels, he nails something that applies to a whole array of allegedly cutting-edge innovations. “A not-insignificant percentage of the population has so decisively internalised the values of the market for their labour,” he writes, “that the act of resculpting themselves to better meet its needs feels like authentic expression.” What he says echoes a key passage in Guy Debord’s visionary text The Society of the Spectacle, published 50 years ago: “Just when the mass of commodities slides toward puerility, the puerile itself becomes a special commodity this is epitomised by the gadget … The only use which remains here is the fundamental use of submission.”Such ornate words speak an enduring truth. Amazing and sometimes life-enhancing innovations, I dare say, are being worked on by tech geniuses across the world. In fields such as driverless transport, virtual reality and blockchain technology, new inventions may eventually transform our lives, and fulfil the cliched big-tech promise about making the world a better place. But that is the not the nature of our current phase of history, nor the absurd and often dangerous creations we are now being offered on an almost monthly basis.Ignore all those whoops. If we do not want to live in a world in which “assistants” trick us into flimsy conversations, and human contact is a chore left to the bottom of the labour market, we do not have to. There is a basic fact about the future the figureheads of big tech too often forget: that what it will look like is actually up to us, not them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5be77eb8940b3ddc5835ac692accda65b9b82b/0_0_4080_2448/master/4080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=691f03f31546567bf548579ef059a63e","title":"jeremy corbyn values brexit detail labour ambiguous","story":"Ambiguity on Brexit has spawned many Jeremy Corbyns, and they all lie in the eye of the beholder, depending on political allegiances, frustrations and hopes. There is the cunning Corbyn: secretly a hard Brexiter but who doesn’t want to alienate remainers. There is the craven Corbyn: pro-remain but too afraid of Brexit populism to be too open about it. There is also another pro-remain version: coy Corbyn, playing a game of political subterfuge, winking at remain Labour voters and waiting for the government to be completely worn down before he swoops in with a campaign for a second referendum. Then there is calm Corbyn: above all else, a democrat and a respecter of the will of the people, so he will grit his teeth and think of England.It is likely that none of these Corbyns exist. He has sent signals that can be interpreted in any of these ways. He has been a strong supporter of withdrawal from the single market, but still won’t come completely off the fence on the matter. He consistently denies interest in a second referendum but also indulges speculation, saying late last year that he would vote remain in a second round. When confronted, he won’t rule a second referendum out.Why all the uncertainty? Perhaps the more straightforward explanation is that Corbyn simply doesn’t care about Brexit enough to engage with it robustly one way or the other.But “indifferent Corbyn” fits no one’s narrative. He cannot be smeared by Blairites as a parochial anti-trade ideologue leading his naive young remain supporters down the Brexit path he cannot be lauded by the party faithful as a wise man with a plan, and he cannot be painted by the right as an open-borders-loving softie.Even his most consistent positions are not necessarily a smoking gun. Voting for article 50, sacking a shadow cabinet minister who called for another referendum, and urging MPs to abstain from votes that make the government’s life harder need not indicate covert support for Brexit. They may be attempts at asphyxiating a combustible issue, one which could be used against him by Brexit-supporting opponents.Sure, Corbyn is interested in Brexit, but only insofar as it is a tool with which to club Theresa May and the Tories. Like last week, where at prime minister’s questions he nailed her on the weakness of her negotiating hand given the isions within her own party.But he doesn’t always show up. In fact, he has received repeated criticism for failing to challenge May in parliament. And his on-off enthusiasm over Brexit exposes the things Corbyn really does care about: austerity, rampant capitalism and inequality. As a frontbench Labour MP told me, Brexit is quite far down his list of priorities. His view of challenging the government does not involve spending lots of time bogged down in technical detail about the Irish border.And that’s fine. Indifferent Corbyn is not necessarily a bad thing – the reason he became popular in the first place is because he had not been swallowed up by the dulling obligations of technocracy, nor did he have the detached tone of other Labour figures who lost the pulse of the party’s voters. These same figures, incensed by Brexit, still do little but scold leave voters for their ignorance and agitate for a second referendum – despite the fact that there’s little polling to suggest there is a popular appetite for one.Even if they are right about the impossible technicalities of leaving the EU, the “it’s all above your head” argument isn’t really a vote winner. There’s a reason it didn’t cut through first time round. Corbyn’s strength remains in his ability to focus on issues such as job security (job losses due to businesses relocating over Brexit uncertainty was his focus in last week’s clash with\u0026nbspMay). Brexit fatigue also works for him. In this month’s English local elections there was a distinct “bins over Brexit” vibe.But Corbyn’s changeability and inconsistent engagement on Brexit also plays into what could be seen as his greatest weakness: that he is only a flagship values politician, valuable on the back benches but not interested in the mundane daily grind of government. Corbyn is NHS, austerity, nationalisation, social housing. He is Stop The War and nuclear disarmament. As far back as the referendum campaign, Corbyn’s listlessness over Brexit fed the impression that he was lukewarm and not leadership material.I sympathise with indifferent Corbyn. Brexit came out of the blue, within a year of his election as party leader.

After all these years in the wilderness he finally had a clean shot, and Brexit got in the way.

When Campion broke through and was recognised as an auteur by her male peers – with the Palme d’Or and three Oscars in her handbag – feminists assumed that more women artists would follow in her wake. They were wrong.There was no great bursting of the financial and cultural dam that held back women film-makers. Instead their work filtered through in drips, excluded from directing blockbusters, and excluded from competition at Cannes and other festivals. “I think we got caught in a complicated supplicancy, a very sophisticated supplicancy,” says Campion.But now, a quarter of a century later, Campion feels that time is up for supplicancy as the #MeToo movement reverberates in the film industry and beyond. “Right now, we’re in a really special moment. I’m so excited about it. It’s like the Berlin wall coming down, like the end of apartheid. I think we have lived in one of the more ferocious patriarchal periods of our time, the 80s, 90s and noughties. Capitalism is such a macho force. I felt run over.”Dipping croissants into coffee in Soho on a trip from her home in New Zealand to London, Campion seems the last person anyone would dare to run over, with her iron will, silver hair and ready laugh. But even after The Piano’s success, Campion’s journey was never easy, and her insistence on a stubbornly female gaze in her work did not translate into big box office returns.She made The Portrait of a Lady (1996) with Nicole Kidman, Holy Smoke (1999) with Kate Winslet, and In the Cut (2003), with Meg Ryan no longer playing the bubbly creature of romcoms but instead handcuffing a detective and having sex with him. That film is experiencing a renaissance back then it was too much for the mainstream male critics. As Campion recently noted: “There’s this sort of mountain of corduroy you have to get through.”So after In the Cut she took a break to look after her daughter Alice Englert, and reappeared in 2009 with Bright Star, the poet Keats’s story from the point of view of his lover Fanny Brawne. It was not until the massive success of the two television series of Top of the Lake (2013 and 2017) that the world caught up with Campion’s point of view again.In 2017, Cannes premiered Top of the Lake: China Girl to acclaim. It was also the 70th anniversary of the festival and Campion joined all the male Palme d’Or-winners on stage. She was the lone woman. “I hadn’t ever really thought about the numbers of women and men that had won the Palme d’Or. I still really hadn’t taken it in. That was the most shocking thing I’d ever been involved in. If there had been no women it wouldn’t be an issue, but man after man came up. I thought, ‘Oh my God! What is going on?’”Money, was the answer. The female talent is there, but the financial backing is missing in film, less so now in television. “I guess at this age I expect to make Top of the Lake as I want it, without any concern for other people’s opinions and taste. I just do what I want, and weirdly people love it.”Many of the themes of Top of the Lake were hatched in The Piano. Wilderness madness colonial and immigrant stories, from the Maori community of New Zealand to Asian immigrants in Sydney and above all, strange, bolshy women unbowed by life’s struggles.“Rewatching my films is like digging up buried bones,” says Campion, who is 64. Yet when she saw The Piano again recently (she laughs that she could only find a French dubbed version, but at least the heroine played by Holly Hunter is mute), “I really felt excited by it. I thought, my God, this is a film told from a female point of view and nowadays that’s still so rare. Even when a story appears to be from a female point of view, it’s often an apology for it.”The Piano is now a classic, unforgettable, with its powerful, surreal imagery, soul-scarring amputation scene, silent heroine, and above all, the erotic electricity played out note by note between Harvey Keitel and Hunter, seated at the carved rosewood piano in a hut deep in the bush.Each watching of the 1850s drama reveals more riches. There is the mute but emotionally devastating performance by Hunter as Ada McGrath, a Scotswoman sent like baggage with her piano to New Zealand to marry a man she has never met. Hunter and Anna Paquin – who plays her young daughter – both won Academy awards, as did Campion’s screenplay. The musical score from Michael Nyman often takes the place of dialogue and the cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh shifts from the epic to the intimate. In writing and directing, Campion set herself a series of challenges: a wordless protagonist, a hostile landscape, a colonial conundrum and then allowed the film to burst out of its own carefully constructed corset.The image of a piano stranded with a woman and child on a volcanic beach beneath glowering cliffs epitomised Ada’s predicament in an isolated Maori and British community in the bush. But the necessary interior nature of Ada’s world, only allowed an outlet through music, sign language and facial expressions revealing contempt or wilfulness, subverts the male-controlled world. Sam Neill plays her husband Alisdair Stewart, who is silently outmanoeuvred by Ada, until his frustration turns to violence.Eventually, the axe falls, but until then, “Ada was experiencing things for herself in her own body and she could close the patriarchy out,” says Campion. “It was really strong for me to see that, and also the intimacy, sexuality and sensuality from a more female point of view.” Surprisingly for the time, when Keitel’s Baines is eventually given permission by Ada to freely make love to her, his first move is to kneel down and disappear beneath her crinoline, favouring her pleasure over his own.The power is also shown to be literally in Ada’s hands she strokes her husband’s naked buttocks with the caresses she also lavishes on the piano keys, but refuses to allow him to touch her in return. Stewart is humiliated. As Campion notes, “This is a very sexual story, and to see him overwhelmed and unable to control what’s happening … that’s quite sexy.”Campion’s taste for wild passion in the wilderness was partly inculcated by the Brontës when she was growing up in Wellington, New Zealand, the daughter of theatrical parents. “I always loved Emily Brontë’s imagination. I feel like she saved my life, in the sense of giving me powerful female stories. To have that model for how a woman and an artist could be was very involving to me.”Speaking of Wuthering Heights, Campion noted Catherine’s strength. “She was not pliant. She was firm of mind and conviction.” For the director, Heathcliff “was a dark metaphor for sexual drive, and Emily had a sexual drive, obviously, and she rode it like a horse.” Campion roars with laughter. “My psyche understood that at a time when it wasn’t being much explored in literature and film.”Sealing these moments on screen, often more with pictures than words, is one of Campion’s great skills. “The most powerful experiences we have as humans are a combination of psyche, love and erotica, which can really lock you in an extraordinarily powerful way to experiences beyond what you know and beyond what you can control,” says Campion. “If you look back at those moments, they are often powerful awakenings, way beyond your comfort zone. There’s a sort of calling against decorum, against what’s best.”She has always championed the unconventional, from her first feature Sweetie (1989), a punkish and ultimately devastating family drama about two sisters, one of whom is mentally troubled. Her second film, An Angel at my Table (1990), was a three-hour television biography of writer Janet Frame, which was so cinematic that it was given a theatrical release.Campion was also fearless about tackling a film with a large cast of Maori actors, and while a few of The Piano’s scenes border on embarrassing in retrospect, she made the effort to find a Maori film director and advisers to work with her. “I had an easier time because I had been out of the country for a long time, so I was desensitised to this feeling that a white person couldn’t have a Maori character. I thought that was crazy when there was a chance for different roles.” There were complexities: some of the Maori actors did not speak their native language. “They felt shame about it, but they learned it. What they really found offensive was the pidgin English we had written, so we changed that and the problem went away. They wanted to work with me – they don’t like people charging in and creating ‘blackgrounds’.”While The Piano has become a landmark of Antipodean cinema, it was in fact financed by a French company, encouraged to take a punt on Campion by the Cannes film scout Pierre Rissient, who died earlier this month just before this interview. “I’m a little bit subdued today because of Pierre,” says Campion. “He brought all my films to Cannes.” Rissient discovered her film Peel, which won best short in 1986.Thanks to Rissient’s championing, The Piano was made and edited while Campion was pregnant with her first child by her husband Colin Englert (second unit director on the film). She flew out to Cannes in May 1993 to the premiere, but she was unable to stay until the end of the festival to pick up her Palme d’Or.“I had to fly back before I couldn’t fly. I was there for the screening but it wasn’t really a good time because my blood pressure was shooting up, with interviews and managing the pregnancy. So I was back in Sydney and I heard that we’d won, which was amazing. Then really shortly after I found out my baby was seriously in trouble – born alive, and died at 11 days. That was the worst time of my life. I really didn’t enjoy any of the success. It almost felt like ‘at the cost of’, weirdly.” Campion still wears her scars painfully close to the surface. “For that time, it felt like that. I did six months of suffering and grieving intensely.”Then she got pregnant with Alice, who now stars in Top of the Lake. Campion says the loss of her son, Jasper, changed her forever. “I am incredibly grateful for having that whole experience of that baby that did not live, because it put me in touch with that kind of suffering. It just changed my perspective forever. When you’ve had a death like that you become part of a club you never leave, and because of the love you feel for them, you never resent it.”The experience resonates in her more recent work in Top of the Lake, in which Robin (Elisabeth Moss) reveals that in the past she was raped and gave the baby away for adoption. She searches for her lost child, and other stories feature surrogacy, miscarriages and loss. “This whole area of female experience is so unknown, but it’s like the equivalent of going to war, except no one makes movies about it,” says Campion.But everyone is making television about it, from Big Little Lies to The Handmaid’s Tale, and Campion’s favoured actresses, Nicole Kidman and Moss, seem to be everywhere. “Hero stories are wearing thin. We have lived a male life, we have lived within the patriarchy. It’s something else to take ownership of your own story.”Ever the iconoclast, Campion is going against the trend by writing her first male lead in her new (untitled) film. “Because at last I feel I can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b618fe8400f2f6d3132c80233ec630ad5f5a77/315_0_5957_3574/master/5957.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934ad80e5e95b41782646d67056e05d6","title":"jane goodall the wild immersion vr safari wildlife","story":"The wildlife legend wants to take the whole world on safari. As her stunning new VR film series launches, she talks about firing up David Attenborough – and explains why Andy Serkis was ‘fantastic’ as an ape‘Amazing!” gasps Jane Goodall, as she tilts her head in all directions, oblivious to the outside world. Goodall is the primatologist who changed our understanding of nature by recording chimpanzees using tools, a skill previously thought to separate humans from animals. But today Goodall is the one mastering a new tool: the 84-year-old is sitting spellbound on a sofa, wearing a VR headset and a wry smile.She’s watching a film from The Wild Immersion, a project intended to raise awareness of – and perhaps even save – the natural world, via 360-degree virtual reality wildlife documentaries. Introduced by Goodall, they really are immersive: you’re practically nuzzling into the pandas’ fur, flying with the flamingos over an African lake. Then a lioness comes up and sniffs your face, before a giraffe walks right over you, its vast legs splayed above you like pillars. So that’s what a giraffe’s underneath looks like. Turn your head and the savannah stretches to the horizon in every direction.“Mouse, you have a go,” says Goodall, passing the headset to her assistant Mary Lewis. We’re in the London offices of the Jane Goodall Institute, which is in Mary’s house. “Aaargh!” screams Mary. She’s just come face to face with a cobra. “My favourite thing is watching other people watch,” Goodall says. “It’s so funny!” Having lived in the wilds of Tanzania for 15 years, Goodall is less fearful. “I used to be afraid if I heard a leopard at night when I was alone up on the peak,” she says. “I’d pull the blanket over my head.” Now the fear is more global. We hardly need reminding that these animals and their habitats, and by extension our own survival, are in mortal danger. The numbers are chilling: 16,000 species in danger of extinction, including a quarter of all mammals and one in five plant species (and much more by the end of the century). It’s time we all stopped pulling the blanket over our heads.That’s where The Wild Immersion comes in. The first three 12-minute films, capturing African savannah, underwater and polar habitats, are debuting at the Cannes film festival. There are plans to exhibit them at venues globally (including in China, the US, and London). Beyond that, headset-makers Lenovo are currently marketing its VR Classroom technology, including The Wild Immersion’s content, to schools in the US, enabling “virtual field trips”. Money raised will fund existing nature reserves and create new ones.It took 120 days of filming, on five continents, to produce 80 minutes of footage, using a small team headed by French film-maker Raphaël Aupy. There was no trickery such as scent or food to attract animals: the cameras were simply placed in the habitats, manned or unmanned. Sometimes they were on drones – or, in the case of the pandas, on the end of four-metre poles. They did lose a few cameras to the lions.“The films are a way of interesting kids in conservation,” says Goodall. “And they may inspire people to save up and go out there and see it for themselves.” There’s also the depressing thought that The Wild Immersion may one day be the only way future generations get to see these creatures – because we’ve made them extinct.Goodall first travelled to Gombe, Tanzania, in 1960 as an untrained 26-year-old researcher, generating such headlines as “Comely miss spends her time eyeing apes” and ruffling scientific feathers by giving the chimps names, before documenting their personalities and relationships. But she discovered what nobody else had: that chimpanzees used tools, hunted strategically and ate other chimps or monkeys, even killed each other. Goodall’s work redefined humanity’s conception of itself. Her book, In the Shadow of Man, has been translated into 48 languages.But Goodall gave up full-time research at Gombe in 1986. “I suddenly realised the chimps were vanishing, the forests were going, terrible things were going on in medical research, and I knew my time had come to do something about it.”Today she occupies a rarefied place in the cultural ecosystem, having been a fixture of naturalism, conservation and environmentalism for more than half a century. Elegant, unflappable, calm of voice, sharp of intellect, awesome of reputation, she returns to Gombe twice a year but is no longer on first-name terms with the chimps. She spends most of her time travelling – lecturing, campaigning, visiting the innumerable outposts of her institute. Just hearing her current itinerary is exhausting: a few days in England (home is still Bournemouth, with her sister’s family), then “Austria, Hungary, Sweden, Holland, back five days, then all over Africa: Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa, Kenya – I’ve just cut out the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Congo, but I’m away, what is it, two weeks?”“Four weeks in Africa,” Lewis corrects her. “I never know,” Goodall smiles. She is in constant demand: “Will I write this? Will I endorse this? People wanting video messages for conferences I can’t attend. I can’t do it all.” The Wild Immersion was such a request. The company’s French founder, Adrien Moisson, an entrepreneur with a background in marketing and veterinary science, secured an audience with Goodall while she was in transit at Heathrow two years ago, convincing her this would be a worthwhile venture.So the virtual Goodall can now be in places the actual one can’t. “Changing minds, that’s the key,” she says. “How do you change the mind of somebody who thinks it’s fine to cut down a forest? It’s never easy. It’s no good arguing with them because they’ll argue back. So the only way is telling stories.”The cinematic potential of Goodall’s own story has not gone unnoticed. In 2016, it was told in Jane, which benefited from rediscovered lustrous colour footage of her time in Gombe, not to mention a bonus love story. It was shot by Hugo van Lawick, the dashing National Geographic cameraman who would become her first husband. Then there was the 1965 TV documentary, Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees, narrated by Orson Welles.Unsurprisingly, Goodall has little time to watch movies. “I haven’t seen any of the Star Wars or Mission Impossibles,” says, though one franchise has not passed her by. “I did see Planet of the Apes because they consulted us on the chimp behaviour. Andy Serkis: I thought he was fantastic as Caesar. They got it really right.”Goodall knows there are limits to how much film, TV and VR can do to fix the world’s problems. Viewing creatures in unsullied natural habitats can reinforce the impression that there’s plenty of nature still around so we need not worry. And even if it doesn’t induce apathy, conservationist sentiment only really counts if it is translated into action.Goodall recalls discussing this with David Attenborough. “There was one time, years ago, when he was going to give up. When I talked to him, he was totally depressed and feeling hopeless. Then somehow something happened and he ed back in.” What did she say to him? “I did my usual spiel, ‘We can’t give up.’”“Most ordinary people just feel, ‘What can I do to help?’ So they do nothing. My life mission is to give people hope, because without hope you don’t bother. Being abusive is not going to get you anywhere. You need to reach the heart. Once you’ve reached the heart, you’ve got somebody for good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcddef938350d0ab9728b6e92fd65d06de93f71f/405_306_3523_2114/master/3523.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f420a444862c2c11c8082601602d2a","title":"manuel neuer germany bayern munich goalkeeper","story":"In an extract from Grant Wahl’s new book, the Germany and Bayern Munich captain reveals his goalkeeping philosophy and explains his sweeper-keeper roleModern football has a lot in common with the German autobahn. The speed of the game has no limits these days and the players are like finely calibrated sports cars: faster, sleeker and more powerful than ever. Movement is constant, and yet\u0026nbspthere remains an order to things,\u0026nbspa reminder that even on the edge, there are forces that prevent chaos. No player better illustrates this than Manuel Neuer, the world’s\u0026nbspbest goalkeeper, who has redefined his position. “I’m a little bit risky, but I’m standing for security and protection, and you have to give your team-mates that feeling as well,” says Neuer, captain of Bayern Munich and Germany. “In life, I’m a guy who likes to drive a car quite fast, but I wear a seat belt at the same time.”The downside of Neuer’s approach is the football version of hara-kiri. If he misjudges the speed and trajectory of the ball or the striker and arrives too late, he may concede a goal and look silly in the process. “I don’t feel the fear in my head in this moment,” he says. “I am always thinking positive. It’s all about the first step. If I think I will get the ball, I go out. I can’t stop halfway because the goal is empty and the player would have the opportunity to shoot. You make the reaction, and then, of course, you have to be sure to get the ball. But it’s years of practice. You can’t say from one day to the other: ‘Now I will do it,’ you know? You have to feel it.”A goalkeeper from the age of four, he discovered early on that he had a leading foot and a standing leg, and for him it felt more comfortable to jump to his left than to his right in order to make a save. Dives to his right, he says, would often result in awkward landings that gave him bruises on his right hip.Working with a coach, Neuer had to train himself to explode to his right more easily, just as a right-footed player would work on passing and shooting with his left. Even today, Neuer acknowledges that ing and extending his body to his right to stop a shot won’t look the same as when he does the same thing to his left. “It’s the same power, but it looks different because the body changes when you are up in the air,” he says. “When you are lying down on the grass and need to stand up, you stand up in a different way on each side. It’s not symmetrical. The important thing is that you can jump high and long and stand up quickly. It doesn’t have to look perfect, but it has to be quick.”Yet shot stopping, which was once the hallmark of a proficient goalkeeper, is now a bare-minimum requirement. The 21st-century keeper also needs to organise the back line and set-piece defence, command the box on crosses, disrupt opposing attacks outside the box and initiate his team’s attack.Comfort on the ball with both feet is mandatory, as is the ability to play passes to moving targets over short and long distances, with your feet and with an overhand throw. What’s more, the strategic trend of extreme defensive pressing all over the field means goalkeepers often need to make themselves available as pressure-release valves for defenders needing to get rid of the ball.If you watch Bayern Munich regularly, it becomes clear that Neuer almost never boots the ball aimlessly downfield, like so many other goalkeepers do. Under Pep Guardiola, the word you heard most often from the Bayern players describing their attacking philosophy was “control”. Why would you boom the ball downfield and risk giving up control? “The passing game has become more important,” Neuer says. “We rarely just hammer the ball forward. I probably have twice as many touches of the ball now than I used to have at Schalke.”Bayern Munich’s and Germany’s stranglehold on possession often means Neuer has fewer occasions to demonstrate some of the more traditional goalkeeping skills. But he still has to call upon them at times, knowing that one mistake can turn a game. How does he know when to come out for a cross? The thought process on whether to commit is not much different from deciding whether to leave his box to cut off a through-ball – though there tends to be more human traffic in his path on crosses, requiring him to read even more variables in a split second. “You have to know which players are in your area and whether you have a free way to get to the ball,” he explains. “If I know I can’t get the ball, then I have to stay in.”Television commentators sometimes say goalkeepers should always come out for any cross in their six-yard box. But Neuer argues that is not necessarily the case. “It depends how high the ball is coming into the box,” Neuer says. “If it’s a high ball they can’t reach, you know you can go out. But if it’s a very low ball and a striker is there, it’s very dangerous and you can’t go out.” Even today, there are enough variables that the same keeper who will venture 40 yards from his goal to pick off a through-ball will sometimes refuse to move even six yards, depending on the situation.More commonly, though, Bayern’s and Germany’s obsession with control means the ball is at the other end of the field. Neuer says one of the hardest parts of his job is when he hasn’t faced a shot from the opposition in 45 minutes, and then he’s suddenly called into action. “Sometimes in the winter it’s very cold, you know, especially in Bavaria,” he says, half-smiling but fully serious. “It’s not easy in this moment, because you have to go from 0 to 100.”Such is life on the German autobahn.This is an edited extract from Football 2.0: How the World’s Best Play the Modern Game by Grant Wahl.

He says his imprisonment means the delicate peace pact that his gang and others negotiated with the mayor of Quibdó is now dead.Since April, Cuesta, a key figure in the peace talks, has languished in the deprived Colombian city’s overpopulated Anayancy prison, alongside a dozen other ex-gang leaders. Cuesta’s list of convictions over the years is exhaustive, a catalogue of time in and out of prison for offences including extortion and, this time around, the alleged murder of his former lawyer. Yet it wasn’t always this way. Cuesta was once on track to realising his dream of becoming a professional footballer, until life took a turn for the worse and he turned to criminal activity to make a living. Now he has “The peace process has no future here,” reflects the 29-year-old, under the watchful gaze of the guards.The problem is not unusual in Colombia, where the Bogotá government has struggled to enforce a national peace accord in parts of the country where it holds little sway. Quibdó, however, has previously bucked that trend.The city, where the authorities struggle to provide basic services, has long felt abandoned by the state. Its predominantly black population sought to deal with their own safety. The pact over Quibdó’s street warfare once distinguished it from other Colombian cities, riddled with violence and poverty.Now they find their reconciliation process threatened by the same question rocking Colombia as a whole: how should gang members who agree to turn in their arms account for their crimes?The Quibdó pact, signed in September, was an attempt to lower the crime rate before Chocó’s famous San Pacho festival. The gangs agreed to lay down their weapons in exchange for the promise of access to education and work opportunities. Murder rates and vandalism dropped dramatically. “There is one simple problem,” says Quibdó’s mayor, Isaias Chalá. “These kinds of processes usually start from the top and work their way down … from the presidency down. But we started it the other way round.”In April, the Colombian vice president, Óscar Naranjo, travelled to the region, applauding the pact for its success. Three days later, without warning, came the arrests. Chalá claims the order to jail Cuesta and the other gang leaders came from the national police, “as a restorative justice process needs to be carried out”.A former slave-trading hub on the Pacific coast, Chocó remains one of Colombia’s most impoverished and marginalised regions. “Chocó is a region that has been marginalised, stigmatised and abandoned by the government, since the time of post-colonisation,” says Edwar Calderón, a Colombian academic at the University of Edinburgh.Since the signing of Colombia’s peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in late 2016, a power vacuum has been created in areas where the guerillas demobilised, allowing criminal armed groups to expand. “What has happened with the Farc leaving these areas are territories without control. What we are seeing now is the same violence as before, sometimes even worse, but without control,” says Calderón.Amid the renewed violence, he wanted to try find a way to stop young people from joining gangs. Calderón hit upon the idea of using funds from an academic project to create a workshop involving Colombian artists and musicians.With the help of Mr Klaje, a Colombian music group who create instruments from recycled materials, and a group of artists from Fundación Casa Tres Patios in Medellín, a week-long workshop was held in late April.Tatiana Gamboa, a 29-year-old mother from the impoverished Obrero neighbourhood, took part.“It’s important, because all of the people who are here have had some kind of issue with one another,” she says.Another participant, Luis Romaña, 26, talks about displacement in his hometown. “Quibdó has seen a big increase in population over the last decade, a lot of it due to the arrival of displaced people as a result of the armed conflict. The population began to grow, there was no control over this, and we lost security in the city.On the final day of the workshop, young people from a variety of backgrounds, and from rival neighbourhoods, took part in a parade. Old buckets and paint tins were transformed into drums and carnival costumes crafted from sequins and feathers as the participants called for an end to violence in the city.Yeiner Belalcázar Paz, 40, better known as Candyman, is a teacher and the frontman of Mr Klaje. He comes from a neighbourhood in the Colombian city of Cali, where he grew up surrounded by gang crime.“We believe that art has a power that can help with the kind of processes that are happening like the one in Quibdó. It is like a magic tool. The young people here like to dance and sing. They live through art. When they hear a drum it runs through their veins.”Among those taking part was a group of about 15 young people from Reposo 3, a neighbourhood taxi drivers wont go near. One was Baeron Palomeque. “We don’t have a football pitch, a community centre or anywhere to carry out recreational activities, so the dance group is the only thing we have,” he says. “It is helping to keep a lot of these kids off the street and has brought young people from rival neighbourhoods together. The government must do more though.Many of the workshop attendees told of their childhood in the Chocó region.Rosney Mosquera, 29, has just finished her high school diploma. “I’ve been a victim throughout my life. A victim of displacement, moving from neighbourhood to neighbourhood all my life. I’m a victim of rape and of armed conflict.“There is a lot of violence in the neighbourhood where I live. People have always been fighting and killing one another.”The organisers were pleased with the outcome of the event. “When the young people realised that they could work together, they started to integrate, and when this happened they said that they didn’t know why they thought about people from other neighbourhoods the way they did before,” says Candyman.“There were a few young indigenous people there, and the black population of Quibdó. Both usually kept to their own groups. But when we started to do the activities, they started to come together.”On the final day, as the parade made its way through the puddle-laden streets of the city, onlookers peered from balconies, tapping their feet to the infectious rhythms and listening to the young people as they chanted: “Our neighbourhood is your neighbourhood, our street is your street. No more violence, Quibdó.”At one point they went past the prison where Cuesta is being held, reflecting on the ruined pact he built."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4167a1abcdb322bb0b20895dea615856c225bb9/0_44_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e48d7393c8760c723dea32bb47a66f6c","title":"does running a mile a day really improve childrens lives","story":"The Scottish school that asked primary pupils to do 15 minutes of exercise every day started a global trend – and research suggests it really is transforming livesIt was an 80-year-old volunteer who prompted Elaine Wylie, the then headteacher of St Ninians primary school in Stirling, to reappraise the fitness of the children in her school. “Your children are not fit,” the volunteer told her. Wylie was stung by the comment, even though she suspected it was true. The PE teacher confirmed it. “Most children these days are exhausted by the warm-up,” she\u0026nbspsaid.That same afternoon, Wylie decided to send a PE class she was supervising outside to see if they could run around the playing field. “By the end, most of them were doubled up and had a\u0026nbspstitch,” she says. “It was a\u0026nbspshocking\u0026nbspsight.”Afterwards, Wylie asked the class how they thought they had done. They admitted that they were terrible\u0026nbsp– a\u0026nbsppivotal moment because, from that point on, the children took ownership of the problem. Together, they decided that they would go outside for 15 minutes every day and see if they could build up their fitness. That was in February 2012. A\u0026nbspmonth later, almost all of them could run for 15 minutes without stopping. By the summer, every class was doing it and, soon afterwards, the nursery children joined in, too. The Daily Mile had been\u0026nbspborn.Even so, initiatives such as the Daily Mile are only part of the solution. The Department of Health says that children over the age of five should be engaging in at least an hour of moderate to vigorous exercise every day\u0026nbsp– yet only a\u0026nbspfifth of children aged between five and 15 achieve this. Moderate activities could include walking to school, riding a\u0026nbspscooter, or cycling, while vigorous ones include playing chase, football, dancing or\u0026nbspswimming.If that sounds like a\u0026nbsplot to you, you are not alone: in a\u0026nbsprecent nationwide survey, a\u0026nbspthird of parents underestimated how much exercise children need. “Parents and children felt that the biggest barrier to being more active was a\u0026nbsplack of time,” says Susan Coan at Leeds Beckett University, who led the study. “From our research in this area, the main piece of advice would be for families to find ways of being active together that work for them. Small changes are more sustainable and can make a\u0026nbspreal difference – for example, walking part of the way to school or playing active video games as part of children’s screen\u0026nbsptime.”One reason exercise is considered so important for children is because it helps establish lifelong habits. “If you are generally active as a\u0026nbspyoungster, it has a\u0026nbspmoderately positive effect in terms of your intention and commitment to being active as an adult,” says Prof Craig Williams, director of the children’s health and exercise research centre at the University of Exeter. There are also other long-term consequences. Late childhood and early adolescence are critical times for laying down bone, which reaches its peak density in our 20s, declining thereafter. The higher your bone density during youth, the lower your risk of fractures and osteoporosis in later life. “The idea is that we try to put as much bone as possible ‘in the bank’ as youngsters,” says Williams. “The mechanical stimulation of our body weight going through our bones, muscles and tendons when we jump up and down, stimulates our bone cells to grow and lay down new bone.”There is also some evidence that the fitter you are when you are 18, the less likely you are to have cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks, in later\u0026nbsplife.Even so, some question the logic of reducing children’s lesson time by 15 minutes each day surely they could find ways of being more active at other times? Yet, according to a\u0026nbspconsensus statement released by Williams and 23 other child-health experts in 2016: “Time taken away from lessons for physical activity is time well spent and does not come at the cost of getting good grades. Physical activity has been found to boost young people’s brain development and function, as well as their\u0026nbspintellect.” Indeed, in a previous study, Brooks found that a single bout of exercise left children feeling more awake, increased their attention and verbal memory and improved their feelings of wellbeing.The fact that the Daily Mile takes place outside could enhance these effects further. “Bright light directly influences and activates areas of the brain that control alertness and cognition,” says Dr\u0026nbspRachel Sharman, a\u0026nbspsleep researcher at the University of Oxford. It can also tweak the timing of the body clock\u0026nbsp– exposure to bright light during the morning tends to advance the clock, meaning people wake and feel sleepy earlier. “In primary schoolchildren, exercising outdoors for 15 minutes is unlikely to have much effect because they are already relatively early birds. However, at puberty, the circadian clock delays,” Sharman explains. “In teenagers, an early morning mile could pull the clock a\u0026nbsplittle earlier, waking the teen up, when their bodies are\u0026nbsp– from a\u0026nbspcircadian rhythm perspective\u0026nbsp– still asleep. In terms of learning, we would then expect the teen to be in a\u0026nbspbetter place, cognitively, to learn in those first few lessons of the day. Equally, by pulling the clock earlier, a teenager may then find that their body clock signals when it’s time for bed earlier the next night, meaning they get more sleep.”In the six years since its launch, the Daily Mile has been adopted by half of Scottish primary schools and a\u0026nbspquarter of English ones. Such is its success, that the Daily Mile Foundation has just launched an adult version, with the hope of inspiring even the busiest of people to incorporate 15 minutes of self-paced walking, jogging or running into their daily lives. As for the children of St Ninians, they continue to run outside for 15 minutes a\u0026nbspday in all weathers, even though Wylie left the school two years ago. Last year, the primary 6 girls (the equivalent of year 5 in England and Wales) won the Scottish schools cross-country\u0026nbspchampionship.Wylie’s intention was simply to get the children fit, but what has pleased her most is the levelling effect it appears to have: “It seems that the less fit and more overweight the kids are at the start, the more they benefit,” she says. Given that obesity is more prevalent among lower socioeconomic classes, interventions such as the Daily Mile could help to close the gap in health inequality between rich and poor. If true, 15 minutes a\u0026nbspday would be a\u0026nbspsmall price to\u0026nbsppay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45063def60a31d54dd090ee67b3eb2b3e886d74c/0_229_5122_3073/master/5122.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7f52a32c5c2b5b16c417940686f71f","title":"seven ways to manage anxiety","story":"There is some evidence that herbal products such as kava, galphimia, German chamomile, bacopa, ginkgo, roseroot and others may reduce anxiety symptoms due to their sedative effects. The most researched of these is kava, which has been found to be effective in several placebo-controlled trials, and may compare favourably to benzodiazepines. However, for all these products, research studies remain limited. There have also been safety concerns regarding kava due to some reports of liver toxicity. If you are considering herbal medicines, you should discuss with your doctor, especially regarding any medication you’re already taking.A few studies have suggested that nutriceuticals can help reduce anxiety. One fairly large placebo-controlled trial found that magnesium decreased anxiety in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, while another study of 100 anxiety patients suggested that the supplement a-casozepine peptide could help. In patients with panic disorders, inositol has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Again, as with herbal products, consult your doctor before taking supplements in case of adverse interactions with medications.In the past few years, a range of free apps have been developed to try and tackle anxiety. Flowy – designed with assistance from the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma at King’s College London – uses a game situation to reduce anxiety and panic, coaxing the user into practising breathing-control. In a 2017 study, the IntelliCare suite of apps – which teach users self-management skills for tackling anxiety based on psychological research – was found to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms.Caffeine is a psychostimulant and there are many decades of research to suggest it can both exacerbate the symptoms of GAD and also trigger panic attacks. Likewise, while many people with anxiety turn to alcohol as a calming sedative, that can trigger a vicious circle, where stress levels increase once the alcohol is processed and the initial effects wear off.Trying yoga, massage therapy or meditation can help keep anxiety under control, while practising various relaxation techniques for 30 minutes, two or three times a day, can also help with the muscle tension that anxiety can cause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1564c0d1b292707bce2fae60e47b1d93dedaef39/0_0_3543_2362/master/3543.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d7059c3ab5b763934e6e534b97e9216 660w","title":"machine head review roundhouse london","story":"Roundhouse, LondonThe pioneering rockers deliver a thunderous show that passes in a blur of flailing limbs, airborne beer – and furious politicsAfter receiving some uncomfortably mixed reviews for their latest album, Catharsis, Machine Head could have embarked on their latest world tour with major concerns about the state of their reputation. The cheering reality is that virtually every show on the Oakland quartet’s current tour has sold out, including two nights at the Roundhouse.Billed as “An Evening With ...”, there is something gently revolutionary about the way Machine Head have abandoned standard package tours and festival slots, preferring to eschew support acts and play for the best part of three hours every night. It’s an approach that suits them perfectly, partly because they have a catalogue big enough to make it work but also because frontman Robb Flynn’s lyrics have taken on a furious political edge of late, subtly isolating the band from their peers in the process.Emerging in front of a stark, ghostly backdrop and launching into the bullish, dramatic Imperium, tonight feels like a victory for Flynn’s crew from the start. Friday night’s crowd had been a little subdued, but Saturday’s is anything but: the swirling mosh pits that erupt during the post-Charlottesville tirade of Volatile are but an hors d’oeuvre for the explosion of crowd-surfers, circle pits and startlingly loud singalongs that steadily build in strength through the show. It’s the classic, heavy tracks that have the most impact, of course. Now We Die, Ten Ton Hammer and Locust all fly by in a blur of limbs and airborne beer. After 25 songs and nearly three hours, Flynn conducts the audience through the dark and brutal but thrillingly euphoric Halo and, for a few thunderous moments, Machine Head seem like the only current metal band who really matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53c0f1938d9b479a5c56591572c4d8d21c52317/0_89_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a701c940a8b7336c9b24d3ba82285a09","title":"russian dirty money is damaging uk security mps say","story":"Government must stop money laundering by ‘kleptocrats and rights abusers’, which is helping Putin subvert international rulesA powerful committee of MPs has warned that the government is putting national security at risk by allowing “kleptocrats and human rights abusers to use the City of London to launder their ill-gotten funds to circumvent sanctions”. The foreign affairs select committee said the government’s lax approach to tackling international money laundering is putting money “directly into the hands of regimes that would harm the UK, its interests and its allies”. In a hard-hitting report titled Moscow’s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK, the committee said the government was failing to follow through on the prime minister’s “robust rhetoric” in the wake of the Skripals’ poisoning. “These assets, on which the Kremlin can call at any time, both directly and indirectly support President Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy.”Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the committee chair, said: “We can no longer allow ‘business as usual’. The UK must be clear that the corruption stemming from the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets and we will act.“The scale of damage that this ‘dirty money’ can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City. There is no excuse for the UK to turn a blind eye as President Putin’s kleptocrats and human rights abusers use money laundered through London to corrupt our friends, weaken our alliances, and erode faith in our institutions.”The report said the UK’s weakness to act to stem the flow of potentially questionable Russian money was exposed just days after the UK expelled two dozen Russian diplomats following the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. “On 16 March – two days after the government announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the UK – Russia raised $4bn (£2.97bn) in eurobond issuances, nearly half of which were bought by investors from the UK,” the report said. A day earlier Russian energy company Gazprom raised €750m (£656m) in a bond sale, some of which were bought by UK investors according to VTB Capital, a Russian bank subjected to US sanctions.Following the sale, the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted:“The ease with which the Russian government was able to raise funds in London despite the strong measures that the government took in the wake of the Salisbury attack raises serious questions about the government’s commitment to combating Russian state aggression,” the report said. The committee also said the flotation of En+, a Russian energy company controlled by oligarch Oleg Deripaska on the London Stock Exchange last year, was also an example of “the contradictions inherent in UK government policy towards Russia”. Tugendhat said the government must be “clear that the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets. We must be united in our efforts to match rhetoric with action – in the City, through government policy and among allies in the US, G7 and EU,” he added.“We call on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to set out a coherent strategy on Russia that clearly links together the diplomatic, military and financial tools that the UK can use to counter Russian state aggression.”The committee recommended that the government close gaps in the sanctions regime that have allowed companies to use London markets while being sanctioned in other jurisdictions. It also suggested that sanctions be extended to target more iniduals who are closely linked to President Putin’s regime. Deripaska has previously described the grounds for including him on a US sanctions list as groundless, ridiculous and absurd.Speaking before the report’s publication, the Russian ambassador to London, Alexander Yakovenko, said: “We believe that the statements like ‘someone is a friend of somebody’ is not the legal basis for taking decisions against someone.” He warned that Russian citizens based in London “could go to the courts and put certain things in front of the courts. They are going to complain – some of them are preparing these moves and the government should think twice.”He added Britain had a reputation to protect as a believer in the rule of law.

But it happens. Nothing you can do about it. He came out way faster, played way more aggressive than I did. It took me a long time to get activated again. I ran out of time. The break took my momentum away.”Asked how he might convert his good run of three-setters to the much different challenge of a slam, he said: “I will try to play the same way over a longer period of time. But I don’t even want to think about tennis the next few days, then to Paris, where Rafa will be the favourite, no doubt about it.”Ten years separate them in age, there is a gap of $90m in career earnings and the Spaniard now has 70 more titles than the 21-year-old world No 3. But Zverev is here to stay. He is growing in power and confidence and, seeded second in Roger Federer’s absence, he will be a threat at the French Open, which starts on Sunday and where Nadal will reach for his 11th Coupe de Mousquetaires. They cannot meet until the final.The demands of winning seven best-of-five matches in a row is still a huge ask for Zverev – as it will be for Dominic Thiem, who stopped Nadal’s run of 50 clay sets in a row in Madrid 9 days ago, before losing in the final to Zverev.The rival most likely to stop Nadal at Roland Garros could still be the man he has played 51 times over 12 years, and whom he beat for the 25th time in the semi-final on Saturday. Djokovic provided an exhausting test of Nadal’s game from start to finish this was a stop-start skirmish, because of the elements and the efforts of the combatants.The sharpness the German showed in pushing Kyle Edmund deep and wide in their close third-round battle was not quite there in the early exchanges. He had to take risks he could get away with against lesser players. From there, errors crept into his game.He had been 40-love up in the sixth game when a lazy forehand handed Nadal another break opportunity and he cashed, in when a return popped up off the net, to go 5-1 up after half an hour. He served out the set, untroubled.The match was then turned on its head. Zverev put his heart and soul into a fightback and he finally got a look on Nadal’s serve in the second game and forced Nadal wide enough to overstretch on his forehand for the break.Zverev held to love and, in the space of a few minutes, the complexion of the contest changed from walkover to engaging theatre to potential upset.The fourth game was pivotal – in the match and possibly in Zverev’s season. He got overexcited when he dumped a forehand when trying to pass Nadal at the net for a 4-0 lead, then lobbed long. He outfoxed him in an exchange of drop shots to grab another break point – this time sealing it with a devastating backhand down the line. His fist-pump to his box screamed defiance and resolve.The match was taking on an eerie familiarity for Nadal. In Buenos Aires 13 years ago, he beat Gastón Gaudio 0-6, 6-0, 6-1. There would be no bagel – nobody has done that to him since Roger Federer in Hamburg nine years ago – but he could not stop Zverev wrapping up the set 6-1 with another unreachable backhand.Zverev played a drop-shot to engineer the break at the start of the final frame – and, as the rain arrived, he held for 2-0. The gathering – including most of Nadal’s family – took in a gasp of warm, moist air. For Zverev, impatient to finish the job, a 22-minute pause to let the showers pass was a minor irritant. For Nadal, it allowed him time to regroup and when they resumed ever so briefly in a light drizzle he held for 2-3. Again, the rain held up the royal progress.Nadal was asking the more searching questions. His whipped forehand was down from a tournament average of 193kph to 167kph, yet he still bossed the important exchanges with angles and timing.Trailing in the serving cycle, Zverev struggled to control his temperament and his opponent. Another attacking lob drifted long and Nadal finished the job with a backhand drop shot that not even the fleet-footed Zverev could reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30d0ee918af039bd90f71d057266489bc644fac/0_124_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c0e7b2afbe24d2f51f0f49f68ff8cbc","title":"simon yates giro d italia stage 15 cycling","story":"Two days before the time trial which could prove a decisive moment in the 101st Giro d’Italia, Simon Yates took his third stage victory of the race at the Sappada ski resort on Sunday , extending his overall lead over the defending champion, Tom Dumoulin, beyond the two-minute barrier. It was a massive step towards what could be a first British win in the Giro while the race favourite, Chris Froome, flopped badly following his stage victory on Saturday, with the overall win slipping further out of reach.With two short sharp climbs in the final kilometres and a further ascent to the finish, this stage finish favoured Yates’s punchy, attacking style more than the relentlessly steep slopes of Saturday’s finish on Monte Zoncolan. He made two incisive attacks in rapid succession at the foot of the penultimate ascent, Costalissoio the first pulled an elite group of half a dozen clear of the remnants of the lead peloton and the second took him clear for good.Yates decided to press on immediately after the rapid, chilly descent from the Passo di Sant’Antonio, which led straight up on to Costalissoio without giving the riders a pause to gather breath or stretch the legs. Froome was already floundering a little way behind as Yates’s team-mate Haig increased the pace, prompting the New Zealander Bennett to make a brief, unsuccessful attack.When the pink jersey had flown, Dumoulin was left in the company of four other contenders for the podium: Domenico Pozzovivo, Miguel Ángel López, Richard Carapaz and Thibaut Pinot. Only the Frenchman Pinot was willing to collaborate consistently with the Dutchman Dumoulin, who could be seen gesticulating at the quartet in an attempt to make them cooperate.Dumoulin was briefly dislodged by his four companions on the final ascent to the ski resort but regained contact when they began marking each other with their minds on the time bonuses awarded for second and third places behind Yates, whose stage victory looked assured from the moment he went past the five kilometres to go mark with 51sec in hand. The Dutchman ended the stage third, just behind López, but his loss of 47sec to Yates, including bonuses, extended his deficit to 2min 11sec.Stage 15 (Tolmezzo - Sappada 176km)\u0026nbsp1 Simon Yates (Gbr) Mitchelton-Scott 4hrs 37mins 56secs, 2 Miguel Angel Lopez (Col) Astana Pro Team at 41s, 3 Tom Dumoulin (Ned) Team Sunweb, 4 Domenico Pozzovivo (Ita) Bahrain-Merida, 5 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar Team, 6 Thibaut Pinot (Fra) Groupama-FDJ all at same time, 7 Alexandre Geniez (Fra) AG2R La Mondiale at 1m 20s, 8 Davide Formolo (Ita) Bora-Hansgrohe, 9 Pello Bilbao (Spa) Astana Pro Team, 10 Sam Oomen (Ned) Team Sunweb all at same time\u0026nbspGeneral classification after stage 15\u0026nbsp1 Simon Yates (Gbr) Mitchelton-Scott 65hrs 57mins 37secs, 2 Tom Dumoulin (Ned) Team Sunweb at 2mins 11secs, 3 Domenico Pozzovivo (Ita) Bahrain-Merida at 2m28s, 4 Thibaut Pinot (Fra) Groupama-FDJ at 2m37s, 5 Miguel Angel Lopez (Col) Astana Pro Team at 4m27s, 6 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar Team at same time, 7 Chris Froome (Gbr) Team Sky at 4m52s, 8 George Bennett (NZl) LottoNL-Jumbo at 5m34s, 9 Pello Bilbao (Spa) Astana Pro Team at 5m59s, 10 Patrick Konrad (Aut) Bora-Hansgrohe at 6m13s\u0026nbspAs for Froome, Yates had failed to overhaul the Team Sky leader in the final kilometres up Monte Zoncolan the previous day but 24 hours later Froome looked as if he had not recovered from that monumental stage-winning effort. At the finish the four times Tour de France winner had dropped from fifth overall to seventh but he is now 4min 52sec behind Yates, suggesting even a place on the podium may be out of reach.There are only six contenders for the podium in Rome on Sunday – seven counting Froome – and Yates’s stage victory puts him on a par with Eddy Merckx and the Italian Gilberto Simoni, the only others to have taken three stage wins while wearing the pink jersey. Those are not the key statistics for the Bury cyclist entering the final week, however.Dumoulin may well wipe out most if not all of that 2min 11sec in Tuesday’stomorrow’s time trial – he is the world champion at the discipline and the flat course will favour him – but the three mountain stages that follow it will give Yates the chance either to regain the lead or to reinforce it, depending on how things stand after Tuesday. The structure of this year’s Giro, with two time trials, one short and one longer if not over-long, means the tactical equation has always been simple: gain as much time on the specialists as possible.“It’s a good gap but he can take two minutes out of me in the time trial in one stage,” said Yates. “I’ve been fighting since Israel to get a good gap. I’m happy with the gap but it could vanish in 35 kilometres.

Comments are open on our series recap blog.We begin where we left off: with Offred – or June, as she is becoming once more – being bundled, pregnant, into a van and driven away. Into the darkness within, or else the light we don’t – and she doesn’t – know.Light is streaming through a metal grille when a viewing hatch is opened, but it is slammed shut again. Audible clues offer no comfort: shouting, dogs barking. On the soundtrack – used sparingly and so effectively – is the signature falling glissando of doom.The hope drains from June’s eyes. Elisabeth Moss can say more with her eyes and her face than most actors can with 1,000 words. It is 10 minutes before she makes her first utterance, but in that time she displays hope, dread, defiance, defeat and strength again. She says very little in the whole episode (mostly in the flashbacks), yet she is mesmerising.June is pulled out by guards with snarling dogs. She – and the other handmaids – are muzzled and herded along a tunnel. What hell is this where the dogs are not muzzled, but women are? Well, Gilead. Fenway Park, to be specific, home to the Boston Red Sox a place of recreation in happier times. Now? A place of execution. Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran, Guinea in 2009, Chile after Pinochet’s coup in 1973 ... the death knell resonates with reality and with history.A massive scaffold has been erected and a row of nooses are lined up. One is placed over each handmaid’s head, as This Woman’s Work by Kate Bush is played. It is one of those moments in this show that somehow manage to find beauty in the darkest trauma.It turns out to be a mock execution, a lesson to be learned. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd on song) shows up with her interpretation of the Christian message and her instruction to love God. “Walk with him and fear him and cleave unto him and you shall obey his word and the word of his servants here on Earth.”Finally, June speaks, offering her own prayer – in her head, at least. “Our Father, who art in heaven. Seriously? What the actual fuck!” It is a moment to gasp for air – of levity, even – and a reminder that humanity still exists. Because the opening is about as intense a TV experience as it is possible to have. I felt it physically, a tightness in the stomach.And that is not the end of it. After the first flashback, to a decision by June and Luke to try for a second child, it is straight back to the nightmare of the present. Aunt Lydia has the handmaids kneeling in the rain, holding rocks out in front as punishment for refusing to stone Janine to death. Filmed from above, it is more beautifully choreographed horror. Janine, incidentally, is on her way to the Colonies. We – the series – will be going, too. And further back, before Gilead, to see how it came about.The first flashback is not all about love and the joy of further procreation. There are warning signs of what is to come. Taking the pill is not a woman’s decision Luke has to sign off on it. “It’s ridiculous,” he says, casually, before signing. Next time – if they had not decided to stop – he would probably have said nothing and signed. There it is, the creeping normalisation.In the next flashback, June is getting a hard time for not picking up her daughter from school the moment she felt ill … for having a job, basically abandoning her child and her duties for her selfish pursuits. In the final flashback, it has begun to kick off: shooting from the gallery in the Capitol building, an explosion in the White House. You are left wondering just how big a leap it is from the Handmaid’s Tale flashbacks to the actual present.It may have been best to leave the show at one season, with Margaret Atwood, open-ended, a hint of better things to come. And with no chance of it becoming diluted or losing the plot. But that was never going to happen – successful doesn’t walk away from an audience.This is next best, exploring not only forward, but backwards, looking at how it came about. No dilution or loss of plot yet, in an extraordinary first episode that will ring on in your nightmares like Aunt Lydia’s bell. Also, think about what has happened since the first series: #MeToo, mass shootings, you-know-who still in the White House, an abortion referendum in Ireland this week … dong, dong, dong, dong. It is not just Aunt Lydia’s bell that continues to chime. While The Handmaid’s Tale continues to be relevant, it needs to be told. Praise be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9b4d79a8de1d26e0cd3cef089b24979d0b8d85d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=963a4aaa5e68eed17e5d678cfb66c00c","title":"brexit tv is it too soon to make great drama out of the eu referendum","story":"The most isive topic of recent British history is being adapted for the small screen – but the best political TV often comes years after the eventChannel 4 is to make a Brexit drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch, who will play Dominic Cummings, the former government special adviser who helped lead the leave campaign to victory. The broadcaster cannot be accused of being anything less than topical: although the referendum took place almost two years ago, the ifs and buts of EU withdrawal are, if anything, less settled than they were in 2016.The question is not whether it is too late to make a topical drama out of Brexit, but whether it is too soon. The vote may have taken place, but in many ways it is still being contested. The terms under which Britain will leave the EU have yet to be negotiated and the Electoral Commission is still investigating whether the leave campaign breached the referendum spending limit. When dramatising recent events, topicality is the point and there is merit in being first. Casting yesterday’s news as narrative history requires a measure of audacity, which in turn creates a stir. But there is also a freedom that comes with being patient. When drama and real life are too proximate, they have to compete. A Very English Scandal, the first episode of which aired on Sunday on BBC One, waited more than 40 years to revisit the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. The main advantages are clear: almost all the people caught up in those events are now dead (Norman Scott being the exception) and thus unable to raise objections. Younger viewers will come to the TV series not knowing the details of the original story. The Crown is busy relitigating history going even further back, in a way that certainly would not have been possible at the time, or even decades afterwards. When dramatising more recent events, timing is crucial, even if it is often more a matter of luck than anything else. Although Peter Morgan’s The Deal was written nearly 10 years after the 1994 Labour leadership battle it sought to dramatise, the story might have been rendered obsolete if, as some predicted, Brown had taken over from Blair by the time it aired in 2003 (he had not Blair hung on for another four years). Channel 4’s Brexit project is due to be broadcast next year, just before Britain leaves the EU. What if things change? At this point, one could hardly describe the Brexit negotiations as being on schedule. Imagine having to reckon with that timetable. That is one of the difficulties with a true political tale: you are stuck with what happens. The story may change, or it may outrun your script, or it may get old quick. Fictional representations of politics can better mirror political realities – or sometimes even anticipate them, the way The Thick of It and Veep seemed to do. None of these difficulties will matter much if Channel 4’s Brexit drama is good and there is no reason to think it won’t be. The real problem may lie not with those it portrays, but with its audience. Brexit is an extremely isive issue, the debate still bad-tempered and raw. At this stage, it seems unlikely that peace will have broken out in a year’s time. Accusations of bias dog every bit of reporting on Brexit, for and against. That is not the ideal atmosphere for the launch of a narrative account that, while it owes its audience and its subjects fairness and honesty, ought to have no business with impartiality. Drama needs to take a stand, if not a side.There is an obvious need for a Brexit TV drama that puts the whole sorry business into perspective for leavers and remainers. I am just not sure I am ready to watch it yet. Are you?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9f4473b8e154bb3a9bde5e504c26561efa6b172/0_151_4541_2724/master/4541.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5127ee7bd8754f9b5d731bcfae4c1275","title":"pope juan carlos cruz","story":"Juan Carlos Cruz, who was sexually abused, says pontiff told him God did not mind that he was gayA survivor of clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him, in arguably the most strikingly accepting comments about homosexuality to be uttered by the leader of the Roman Catholic church.Juan Carlos Cruz, who spoke privately with the pope two weeks ago about the abuse he suffered at the hands of one of Chile’s most notorious paedophiles, said the issue of his sexuality had arisen because some of the Latin American country’s bishops had sought to depict him as a pervert as they accused him of lying about the abuse.“He told me, ‘Juan Carlos, that you are gay does not matter. God made you like this and loves you like this and I don’t care. The pope loves you like this. You have to be happy with who you are,’” Cruz told Spanish newspaper El País. Now 87, Fernando Karadima, the man who abused Cruz, was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.Greg Burke, the Vatican’s chief spokesman, did not respond to questions about whether Cruz’s statement accurately reflected his conversation with the pope.It is not the first time it has been suggested Francis has an open and tolerant attitude toward homosexuality, despite the Catholic church’s teaching that gay sex – and all sex outside of heterosexual marriage – is a sin. In July 2013, in response to a reporter’s question about the existence of an alleged “gay lobby” within the Vatican, Francis said: “Who am I to judge?”The new remarks appear to go much further in embracing homosexuality as a sexual orientation that is designed and bestowed by God. It suggests that Francis does not believe that iniduals choose to be gay or lesbian, as some religious conservatives argue.Austen Ivereigh, who has written a biography of the pope, said Francis had likely made similar comments in private in the past, when he served as a spiritual director to gay people in Buenos Aires, but that Cruz’s public discussion of his conversation with Francis represented the most “forceful” remarks on the subject since 2013.It did not, however, represent a shift in church teaching, Ivereigh said, since the church had never formally made any pronouncements on why iniduals were gay.Christopher Lamb, the Vatican correspondent for the Tablet, said the comments were remarkable and a sign of a shift in attitudes taking place. “It goes beyond ‘who am I to judge?’ to ‘you are loved by God,’” said Lamb. “I don’t think he has changed church teaching but he’s demonstrating an affirmation of gay Catholics, something that has been missing over the years in Rome.”The remarks come as several high profile members of the clergy have sought to publicly make inroads with gay Catholics, many of whom have felt shunned and unwelcome in the church and have been ostracised. Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest in New York who has nearly 200,000 Twitter followers, has led the outreach effort and was chosen last month to serve as a consultor to the Vatican’s secretariat for communications.Martin has argued in his book Building a Bridge that the onus is on the church to make LGBT Catholics feel welcome in the church and to stop discriminating against people based on their “sexual morality”.

With Queqiao in place, China will be able to send a lunar probe to the side of the moon that never faces the Earth. No space program has ever reached that part of the lunar surface because of communications difficulties.In a few days Queqiao will enter the moon’s orbit, about 455,000km (282,000 miles) from Earth. Queqiao – which means “Magpie Bridge” and comes from a Chinese folk story in which an arc formed by birds reunites two lovers separated by the heavens – will then act as a bridge between ground stations and the lunar probe.China plans to send its lunar lander and rover, Chang’e 4, to the dark side of the moon by the end of this year. The lunar probe will carry seeds for growing potatoes and arabidopsis, a flowering plant related to cabbage, for a “lunar mini biosphere” experiment.“The launch is a key step for China to realise its goal of being the first country to send a probe to soft-land and probe the far side of the moon,” said Zhang Lihua, manager of the relay satellite project, according to state news agency Xinhua.A four-minute video of the assembling of the rocket and satellite, accompanied by dramatic background music, was posted by state media outlets on social media on Monday. “My country is awesome,” one internet user wrote on Weibo. “Our conquest is the sea of stars.”For the past decade, China has embarked on a space program aimed largely at catching up to space powers such as the US and Russia. In 2013, China became the third country to make a soft landing on the moon.Chinese space officials aim to attempt a human landing in 15 years. The China National Space Administration released a video in April showcasing its planned outpost, a “lunar palace” on the dark side of the moon, with cabins for scientists.Queqiao will also carry a radio antennae that researchers will use to study the early universe, what astronomers call the “cosmic dark ages” after the big bang and before the first stars in the universe were formed. Being in the shadow of the moon blocks electromagnetic interference from Earth, offering a better view of radio signals in the universe and enabling researchers to “listen” to the cosmos, according to Liu Tongjie, deputy director of China’s Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63d7d4e98231e58911ed079b4e2051be70824765/0_19_5459_3276/master/5459.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f640ecac62fb16a9757c63d02450f927","title":"eu blocking cities efforts to curb airbnb say campaigners","story":"Commission is hypnotised by ‘sharing economy’ and not seeing its downside, says researcherThe explosive rise of short-stay Airbnb holiday rentals may be shutting locals out of housing and changing neighbourhoods across Europe, but cities’ efforts to halt it are being stymied by EU policies to promote the “sharing economy”, campaigners say.“It’s pretty clear,” said Kenneth Haar, author of UnfairBnB, a study published this month by the Brussels-based campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory. “Airbnb is under a lot of pressure locally across Europe, and they’re trying to use the top-down power of the EU institutions to fight back.”While it might have started as a “community” of amateur hosts offering spare rooms or temporarily vacant homes to travellers, Airbnb had seen three-digit growth in several European cities since 2014 and was now a big, powerful corporation with the lobbying clout to match, Haar said.“You can still find the pensioner renting out her spare room for a bit of extra cash,” Haar said. “But a very substantial proportion are commercial operators, often with multiple listings, making big bucks. It’s clearly having an impact on locals’ access to affordable housing, and it’s pretty hard to see it as a sharing economy.”In Paris, registration for short-term lettings is now mandatory Barcelona has suspended all new short-term rental permits Amsterdam has cut its permitted short-term lettings limit from two months a year to one and Berlin has brought back old laws and adapted them to new circumstances.But local attempts to protect residents’ access to affordable housing and preserve the face of city-centre neighbourhoods are being undermined, campaigners say, by the EU’s determination to see the “collaborative economy” as a key future driver of innovation and job creation across the bloc.“The commission seems almost hypnotised by the prospect of a strong sharing economy, and not really interested in its negative consequences,” said Haar. “Commissioners talk about ‘opportunities, not threats’. The parliament, too, recently condemned cities’ attempts to restrict lettings on online platforms.”Since 50-odd platforms, led by Airbnb, urged the commission two years ago to ensure “local laws do not unnecessarily limit the development of the collaborative economy to the detriment of Europeans”, two key EU directives, on e-commerce and services, had been clarified – largely in the industry’s favour, Haar said.Airbnb has welcomed the guidance, saying the commission is trying to provide “clear, simple and consistent” rules that “remove barriers to regular people benefiting from innovations like Airbnb”.Most worryingly for campaigners such as Haar, a formal complaint against Barcelona, Berlin, Paris and Brussels filed by the European Holiday Home Association, of which Airbnb and HomeAway are leading members, alleges “overzealous rules and restrictionsbans” in violation of EU laws. If not resolved by the commission and member states, the complaint could end up at the European court of justice.“Cities have to respond to local pressures, and they need to somehow recapture the legal space to do that,” said Haar. “Decision-makers in Brussels seem far removed from local realities. If we want to defend our right to affordable housing, this battle has to be fought now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700aaed5bc224d3d08ad7bccdece728e43c84732/0_233_4943_2965/master/4943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=422a230aaee98876e1647a74d8f0d20e","title":"germany to roll out mass holding centres for asylum seekers","story":"‘Anchor’ camps will undermine country’s reputation for being welcoming, say criticsMass holding centres that Germany’s interior ministry wants to roll out across the country will stoke social tension between locals and migrants and undermine the welcoming image the country has gained in the eyes of the world, aid organisations have said.So-called anchor centres – an acronym for arrival, decision, return – are designed to speed up deportations of unsuccessful asylum seekers, by containing large groups of people and the authorities who rule on their claims inside the same holding facility.Until now, Germany’s policy has been to embed new arrivals in communities across the country. But Angela Merkel’s government is seeking to reverse its strategy, as a populist backlash builds against the chancellor’s handling of the refugee crisis. “We all know how difficult it is to deport people without protected status after they have been spread out across the country and put down roots in our cities and communities,” the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, told the German parliament last week.“In the future the end of an asylum application will coincide with the start of the deportation procedure,” said the leader of the CSU and former Bavarian state premier, adding that he wanted to see states set up the new centres this autumn.But the transit centre in Seehofer’s home state that is meant to work as a prototype for the scheme has experienced high crime rates, mass protests and rising tensions between asylum seekers and security forces, the  found during a visit to the Max-Immelmann barracks in Manching.The converted army compound is part of a complex outside Ingolstadt, Upper Bavaria, that holds about 1,100 people, mainly from the west Balkans, Ukraine, Nigeria and Afghanistan.“It is like a prison,” said Lucky Raphael, 24, from Nigeria, who said inmates were not allowed to lock their rooms, cook their own food, or go outside to seek work or attend school. “We can go outside, but always in the fear that we could be arrested,” said Raphael, who said he left his home country because of his dire economic and social circumstances, and arrived in Bavaria via Italy.Raphael said had been living in the Manching transit centre for 11 months, though authorities say the average length of stay for people who have arrived here since September 2015 is four-and-a-half months.Bavarian authorities hope to speed up the checking process with technology. They analyse metadata on smartphones and run speech samples through a “voice geometry” programme to determine the travel route and ethnic background of applicants who do not have passports.They are reacting to an increasingly heated political debate about Germany’s failure to deport asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected. Anis Amri, a Tunisian who in December 2016 killed 12 people by driving a truck into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market, had been rejected but not deported. In 2017, about half a million unsuccessful asylum seekers remained in the country.Anchor centres “send out a signal to people who have low chances of being allowed to stay,” said Daniel Waidelich of the Upper Bavarian government. “It’s not worth coming to Germany, because your claim is processed very quickly here.” Since September 2015, the centre in Manching has carried out 1,000 deportations, while 2,500 inmates have left voluntarily.Critics say the new centres create an absurd double-bind on those inmates at the transit centres who have realistic chances of being granted asylum: while they are actively hindered from integrating into German society while their application is pending, they are expected to immediately integrate as soon as they get the all-clear.“Integration is like a four-legged table,” said Willi Dräxler of the Catholic aid charity Caritas, which has four people doing regular voluntary work at Manching. “Language, contacts in the local community, a job and a home are all vital ingredients. If you saw off one leg, the table is going to wobble. Within these transit centres, however, integration isn’t happening at all.”Inside the centres, frustration with long waits often boils over. “We are not told why we are here,” said Kelvi Batin, also from Nigeria. “It would be better if they told us straight away when we arrived that we cannot stay”.While Manching has not seen incidents like the one at a centre in Ellwangen, Baden–Württemberg, where 200 asylum seekers tried prevent the deportation of one inmate, police have to intervene at the compound on a daily basis. In 2017 the police were called 355 times to the Manching transit centre complex.During a recent media tour of the premises, a group of Nigerians staged an impromptu protest, chanting “We want our freedom” and holding up handmade signs reading: “We’re tired of living in camps. Please, we need transfer.”Dräxler said: “Protests about seemingly small issues like food are often actually protests about the conditions in these centres as a whole. The main source of troubles is that the people inside have no perspective and aren’t allowed to work.”The inability of the migrants inside the centre to engage themselves in the community was also stoking resentment and prejudice among the local population, said Gabriele Störkle of the Caritas centre in Pfaffenhofen. “These transit centres are like black boxes the local population isn’t allowed to go inside, so they project all their greatest fear into what is going on inside them.”“Three years ago, Germany was globally admired for its welcoming culture – the pictures from train stations in Munich travelled around the world,” said Dräxler. “What has happened to that culture? Now there is only fear of refugees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3802aed93ba8a6d8e281a75d31d63046f08f96da/382_216_3993_2395/master/3993.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9419da3508703d9f2962117467be7c0b","title":"monday briefing russias dirty money damaging uk say mps","story":"Kleptocrats are exploiting lax City rules and threatening security … Johnson’s Brexit warning … Meghan Markle proclaims ‘I’m a feminist’Kleptocrats are exploiting lax City rules and threatening security … Johnson’s Brexit warning … Meghan Markle proclaims ‘I’m a feminist’Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and it’s my turn to bring you all the news fit to email straight to your inbox.Britain is putting its national security at risk by allowing Russian “kleptocrats and human rights abusers” to use the City of London to launder “dirty money” to circumvent sanctions, according to a hard-hitting report by MPs. The government’s lax approach was putting money into the hands of regimes opposed to the UK, the report by the foreign affairs select committee says, and accuses ministers of failing to live up to tough rhetoric in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning affair. The committee chair, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, says the UK can no longer allow a “business as usual” approach to the Kremlin. “The scale of damage that this ‘dirty money’ can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City,” he says. Our investigative team has produced this very handy guide to explain, by way of Breaking Bad and the Paradise Papers, all you need to know about money laundering.‘She will deliver’ – The cabinet’s cold war over Brexit goes on after a thinly veiled threat from Boris Johnson to Theresa May that she has to deliver a deal that takes Britain out of the customs union. On a trip to Artgentina, the foreign secretary said he was confident the prime minister “will deliver” a deal that keeps the Brexiters happy and avoids what would be a doomsday scenario for them of having to remain in the customs union beyond 2020 – the so-called “backstop” solution. Jacob Rees Mogg, the leader of backbench hardliners, has described this outcome in suitably biblical terms as “perpetual purgatory”. But Johnson, in an outward display of loyalty, says his boss must be given “time and space to negotiate this Brexit vision”. Our columnist Nesrine Malik, meanwhile, says Jeremy Corbyn must show some leadership on Brexit – hard, soft, whatever, just some leadership.Trump trashing – Back to Russia, or at least its tentacles, and Donald Trump’s never-ending imbroglio over the investigation into his campaign’s alleged links to the Kremlin. On Sunday the US president lashed out at the New York Times for reporting that his oldest son and other aides met in August 2016 with a representative of two Gulf states offering to help the Trump campaign. Those people are now cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation, the report said. Trump earlier said he was asking the justice department to examine the possibility that the FBI had infiltrated his campaign.Rough justice – Vulnerable homeless people are being punished by the courts and even imprisoned for begging and rough sleeping, according to a  investigation. More than 50 local authorities have targeted homeless people with public space protection orders (PSPOs). Examples include a man jailed for four months for breaching a criminal behaviour order for begging in Gloucester and another who was fined £105 after a child dropped £2 in his sleeping bag.Cougar attack – The horrifying story of the mountain biker mauled to death by a cougar in Washington state prompted questions about what the man and his friend could have done to avoid the attack. But police have said the men did everything right by getting off their bikes and making a lot of noise when they realised the lion was following them on the remote Cascade mountains track. Although the animal was chased off initially, it returned and dragged one of the men to his death. “Something was wrong with this cougar,” police said.You really didn’t think the briefing was going to miss out on the royal wedding did you? As Windsor begins its mighty cleanup, the Duchess of Sussex (aka Suits star Meghan Markle) has announced her arrival with a profile on the in-laws’ family website. “I’m proud to be a woman and a feminist,” it says, and tells us that she has been interested in social issues from an early age helped by stints as a volunteer in the soup kitchens of her native Los Angeles. And in case you missed it, Hadley Freeman invokes the John Goodman film King Ralph to argue that the duchess could be just the right American that the royal family needs.Gary Cahill, the Chelsea captain, has urged the club’s board to end the uncertainty surrounding Antonio Conte’s future at Stamford Bridge after leading his team to victory in the FA Cup final. A year after Alexander Zverev announced his arrival in the big time by crushing Novak Djokovic to win the Italian Open, the young German held his own but not his crown as Rafael Nadal outlasted him to win his eighth title in Rome. Meanwhile, the women’s world No 1, Simona Halep, collapsed spectacularly in her rematch with Elina Svitolina to hand the Ukrainian a second Italian Open title. England’s rugby World Cup preparations have been thrown into turmoil with their defence coach, Paul Gustard, leaving Eddie Jones’s coaching staff to join Harlequins.

The day of a heroic victory! The day of a beautiful victory - of a truly popular victory,” Maduro shouted.Tibisay Lucena, the head of Venezuela’s electoral commission, told reporters Maduro had received more than 5.8m votes compared to the 1.8m of his nearest rival, Henri Falcón.  As results came out, Maduro supporters reportedly let off fireworks in poor Caracas neighbourhoods and danced to Latin pop around the downtown Miraflores presidential palace.But even before Maduro’s victory speech, domestic opponents and much of the international community were denouncing the election as a “fraud foretold”. Henri Falcón claimed widespread vote buying and electoral irregularities meant the election was “illegitimate”. “We do not regonize this electoral process as valid,” he told reporters. “As far as we are concerned there has been no election. There must be new elections in Venezuela.” “All Venezuelans know what happened today,” tweeted Henrique Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro in the 2013 election and was subsequently barred from running again. “Our beloved Venezuela must have truly free and democratic elections where the will of our People is reflected in the result.”Luz Mely Reyes, a prominent Venezuelan journalist, tweeted: “Today is a sad day for democracy. The government clings on and manipulates, the opposition is ided and lacking a strategy. And voters are without guides or leadership.”The United States’ mission to the United Nations indicated it would reject the result. “Today’s so-called election in Venezuela is an insult to democracy ... It’s time for Maduro to go,” it tweeted.The president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, said that his country, “like the majority of democratic countries”, would not recognise the vote. “Venezuela’s elections do not meet the minimum standards for a true democracy. They are not clean or legitimate elections and they do not represent the free and sovereign will of the Venezuelan people,” Piñera wrote.“You have put your trust in me and I will pay back this infinite, loving trust,” he said. To cries of “Vamos, Nico!”, Maduro added: “Today I love the Venezuelan people more than ever before!” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Problems with link between Wicklow and Dublin station to persist due to fire damageTaoiseach says cases of fatal foetal abnormality changed his views on terminationsTurnout crucial to outcome of the referendum on the Eighth AmendmentMinister for Transport Shane Ross gives two-month deadline for international teamRedbreast 32-year-old whiskey was sold on members-only websiteRCSI chief says: \u0026lsquoI think we should be more circumspect... my fear is a hyper-response\u0026rsquoGynaecologist: Doctors cannot provide same care to women having terminations abroadMarket will not be \u0026lsquogeneric\u0026rsquo but sprinkled with \u0026lsquomagic dust\u0026rsquo, says council executiveMartin Callinan to be quizzed over alleged attempts to blacken Maurice McCabe\u0026rsquos nameCliona Johnson\u0026rsquos son John Paul lived for 17 minutes after being born with anencephalyNo campaign targets politicians and tells voters \u0026lsquosend them back for something better\u0026rsquoFirst phase of new development at St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green being plannedDriver of black Nissan Qashqai was being sought in connection with disappearance of Jastine Valdez (24) in EnniskerryTalks convened by Shane Ross with unions and authorities to get under way on Monday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502274.1526843650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in muff we pray for the president in culmore the queen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArchdeacon Robert Miller at Muff Church of Ireland in Co Donegal. Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502193.1526838811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"voters in north would support remain more strongly in second referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe survey was carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council which is funding the UK in a Changing Europe project.  Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire People in Northern Ireland would vote more strongly to remain in the European Union if another Brexit referendum was held, a new study suggests.A total of 69 per cent would favour remaining if there was another vote compared to the 56 per cent who voted to stay in the union in June 2016, the survey by the UK in a Changing Europe project found.Catholic respondents were much more likely to support a united Ireland if there was a “hard exit” in which the UK left the customs union and single market.Some 28 per cent of Catholics would vote for a united Ireland if the UK changed its mind and remained in the EU while 53 per cent of Catholics would vote for a united Ireland if there was a hard exit in which the UK left the customs union and single market.The Irish Border is one of the most difficult questions facing negotiators who aim to strike a deal by the autumn ahead of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU next year.Brendan O’Leary, Lauder Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, who also holds a visiting position at Queen’s University Belfast (QUB), said: “The proportion wanting to Remain has risen since the 2016 referendum as more people have become aware of the possible costs and inconveniences of leaving the EU, as citizens and as employees or employers.”The survey was carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council which is funding the UK in a Changing Europe project. It said it provided an authoritative, non-partisan and impartial reference point for those looking for information, insights and analysis about UK-EU relations that stands aside from politics surrounding the debate.Some 61 per cent of the North’s population favoured the UK as a whole remaining in the customs union and single market.The survey also found there were strong expectations that protests against checks at the Irish Border or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would quickly become violent.Meanwhile, a British government working group including Brexit secretary David Davis, business secretary Greg Clark and Northern secretary Karen Bradley visited Belfast yesterday for what was described as a “customs fact-finding mission”.A statement from the Department for Exiting the European Union said the visit was “part of their working group exploring potential future customs arrangements, focusing on the proposed Highly Streamlined Customs Arrangements”.The department said the working group met representatives from the freight industry, cross-Border businesses and community stakeholders to “further explore how the highly-streamlined customs model could address the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland”.

Both Skripals survived the attack.The Government has blamed the Kremlin for ordering the attempted murder and said it would investigate Russian wealth as part of its response.Mr Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £8 billion, made his fortune in Russia\u0027s oil industry in the 1990s. The billionaire, 51, has been a frequent visitor to London since he bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003.Unlike some other wealthy Russian investors, he never took UK residency but has continued to visit the UK on a Tier-1 visa.Amber Rudd ordered a review of Russian holders of Tier-1 investor visas in MarchHe was not at Wembley on Saturday night, when Chelsea defeated Manchester United 1-0 in the FA Cup final.  Mr Abramovich has not attended every Chelsea cup final in the past, and it is not clear whether the delay in issuing travel documents affected his travel plans.Earlier this year Swiss newspapers reported that he had twice applied for residency in Switzerland.In January the island of Jersey offered him residency as a high value inidual.The same month, he was included on a list of officials and oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin that could serve as a basis for future US sanctions.  Although the “name-and-shame” list of 210 people published by the US Treasury did not stipulate any punitive measures, it was drawn up as part of sanctions legislation reluctantly signed by Donald Trump in August.  Tier 1 visas are open to applicants from outside the European Economic Area who are willing to invest at least £2 million in the UK economy.The visas are valid for three years and four months, and can be extended another two years before requiring renewal.The Home Office website says applicants can expect a decision on an application within three weeks.A spokesman for Mr Abramovich declined to comment.Ben Wallace, the Home Office security minister, said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.He added: In 2014 and 2015 we took action to tighten up the Tier 1 investor route. This included introducing new powers to refuse applications where there are reasonable grounds to believe funds have been obtained unlawfully. As a result of these reforms, applications reduced by 84 per cent.“As the Prime Minister and former Home Secretary made clear, we are taking another look at how the route operates and are undertaking further checks on investors who came to the UK through this route before the reforms were introduced.”Inside the royal wedding evening reception: Idris Elba turned DJ as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle danced to 1980s hits and R\u0026ampBRoyal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearMost restaurant diners want calorie counts on the menuCrowded platforms and hour-long wait for trains after new timetable causes commuter chaosHow Nicolás Maduro\u0026#39s implausible election victory could also prove to be his pitfallA Very English Scandal, episode 1 review: Hugh Grant is both charming and bone-chilling in this brilliant take on the Thorpe affairRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry start married lifeMeghan Markle to fight for feminism: Prince Harry\u0026#39s new wife given Palace blessing to champion women\u0026#39s rightsBunnies, badgers, and the bizarre truth behind episode one of A Very English Scandal Antony Gormley: Subject, Kettle\u0026#39s Yard review – A highfalutin way to recycle old ideasRoyal wedding guest list: Celebrities from the Clooneys to the Beckhams, and Pippa MiddletonInside the royal wedding evening reception: Idris Elba turned DJ as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle danced to 1980s hits and R\u0026ampBRoyal wedding bridesmaids and pageboys: From Prince George to the Mulroneys, meet the real stars of the big day Royal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Who is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?Comment: The effortless art of weediculture is definitely my kind of gardeningThe 8 things you might have missed this weekend amidst wedding-feverNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry will live as a married coupleWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/20/TELEMMGLPICT000164133342_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqeo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"royal wedding a list guests give glimpse prince harry meghan","story":"Celebrity friends of the Duke and Duchess posting pictures of the outfits at the intimate Frogmore House receptionCelebrity friends of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle shared glimpses on social media of the intimate second reception for the couple following the Royal wedding.A select 200 close friends were invited to the evening party at Frogmore House following the main reception at Windsor Castle, which was attended by the 600 guests who were also at the St George’s Chapel ceremony.The smaller reception was billed as a private affair and a chance for the selected guests to relax and celebrate with the happy couple.Frogmore House, a 17th century English country house, stands in the home park of Windsor Castle and is part of the Crown Estate.

How appropriate then that the new Duchess of Sussex’s Givenchy Haute Couture and Stella McCartney wedding gowns should encapsulate this look so elegantly....

But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think, is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant.Asked if there was any tears from the bride, she said: No, she was incredibly composed. It was really quite extraordinary. She\u0027s just the most beautiful person.Asked what the Duchess\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, had thought of her daughter, Ms Waight Keller said: As she went into her car, her mother was already sitting in the car and you just could see there was so much love between them.The Queen was later seen being driven back to Windsor Castle soon after the service at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.As a few Windsor Farm shop regulars watched, her Range Rover swept into a side entrance onto the castle estate.The Queen is driven into Windsor Castle after a Sunday trip to churchThere has still been no sight yet today of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex who are expected to leave Windsor Castle, where they stayed overnight.

The couple spent their honeymoon at Broadlands House in Hampshire – although that would be no guarantee of favourable weather. Kensington Palace said the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to live in Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of the palace, but they are also reported to be moving to a bigger apartment.They have been been living in the cottage since their engagement in November 2017.Reportedly referred to as Notts Cotts, the property - only yards from the Duke\u0027s childhood home within Kensington Palace itself, has been a base for both the Duke and his brother, Prince William, over the past decade.  As the previous occupants, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent two and a half years at the cottage after their royal wedding in 2011, before moving to a permanent apartment inside Kensington Palace to accommodate their growing family. Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage shortly after. An aerial view of Kensington PalaceIt is the smallest of Kensington Palace\u0027s multiple residences, residing in a part of the grounds that once housed important members of staff. There are two rooms and a private garden. In the long term, the Duke and Duchess are expected to vacate Nottingham Cottage for a 21-room Kensington Palace apartment, adjacent to that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.The apartment\u0027s roof and windows have recently been refurbished, while the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester moved out of it last November - giving legs to rumours the newlyweds will move there.As neighbours, the royal brothers could inhabit what was once a single suite of apartments at Kensington Palace, before it was split in two in the 1950s. The apartments are even suspected to share a secret door.The royal brothers will remain as neighbours at Kensington PalaceInitially however, the new Duke will have a cousin for a neighbour: Princess Eugenie and her fiancé Jack Brooksbank recently took-up residence at Ivy Cottage after announcing their engagement in January this year.That wedding will also take place at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, on October 12.Among the 200 guests invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House were senior members of the Royal family.

He writes: The Corporation’s anchors were Kirsty Young (a reassuring voice as ever) and Dermot O’Leary (was he on the wrong channel?). This unlikely pair tag-teamed with Huw Edwards (solid, dependable, a bit boring), who appeared to have been on a pre-wedding diet. Sitting side-on to the camera for some strange reason, the newly svelte Welshman couldn’t quite get his autocue-reading right and kept glancing off-screen as if distracted by something more interesting.ITV\u0027s audience peaked with 3.6 million viewers, at a different time to BBC One - just after 2pm.On ITV, coverage - which was fronted by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham - averaged 2.5 million viewers and a 18.6 per cent share between 9.25am and 3pm.The five-minute audience peak on BBC One is the biggest across all channels this year, the broadcaster said.

with a penalty taken by Eden Hazard, Chelsea beat Manchester United to the FA Cup title on Saturday. Thought likely to be a parting gift from manager Antonio Conte, the Italian head coach lingered

might bring England when the two countries meet in the World Cup next month. Despite Mounrinho\u0027s claims after the game that his team deserved to win, Manchester United gave a lacklustre

her battle to break up the UK.It is expected that the 400-page document will recommend that the pound would be used in a transition period after independence, before moving to a new Scottish currency that would initially be pegged to sterling.Wealthy investors would be given preferential treatment under a separate Scotland’s immigration system using a “golden visa” scheme, it was said, in an attempt to increase the country’s sluggish growth rates.Appearing on ITV’s Peston on Sunday, she argued that a new debate about independence would bring “hope” to Scotland rather than the “despair” caused by Brexit.Read the full story here Italian actress Asia Argento made an impassioned speech during the closing ceremony of this year\u0027s Cannes Film Festival, stunning the audience as

Speeches, including from Meghan herself, were also expected at the evening reception where the couple were to take their first dance.Leaving for the evening reception earlier in the evening Prince Harry proved he was the perfect gentleman as he opened the door of a vintage car to let his bride step in.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a classic E-Type Jaguar heading off to their wedding receptionMs Markle wore a sleek Stella McCartney dress with a halter neck, showing off her shoulders and back with her hair up in a chic bun.The dress was described as a “bespoke lily white high neck gown made of silk crepe”, with satin shoes from Aquazurra with soles painted in baby blue: her “something blue”.Her hair had been styled by George Northwood especially for the more relaxed evening. The couple travelled from Windsor Castle to Frogmore House in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero. The number plate was E19 05 18, marking their wedding date. This vehicle was originally manufactured in 1968, and has since been converted to electric power, suiting the couple’s eco-credentials.Prince Harry opens the door to the Jaguar allowing his wife to get into the passenger seatPrince Harry appears to have given his bride a poignant wedding day gift -

But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And now it might be one of our best hopes of finding alien life in our own solar system.Scientists announced this week that there is a water plume coming out of Europa, a moon of Jupiter and one of the prime candidates for life in our solar system.This comes in the wake of discovering plumes on Saturn’s moon Enceladus, during the Cassini mission, which suggested the strange moon has the building blocks of life. We might find alien life on Jupiter’s ocean moon, Nasa saysWhile the discovery about Europa is brand new, the data used to deduce it was old. The plume itself might be ancient, and could help us to finally solve the mystery of whether are alone in the universe – or even alone in our little patch of it: the Solar System.That’s because, while the plume themselves might be thrilling, they’re more exciting for what they might mean. They are spewing out water that would otherwise be hidden beneath the moon’s thick icy crust, and which would therefore be very difficult to access.“If Europa has plumes erupting into space, that really provides a new window for future exploration,” says Xianzhe Jia, a space physicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the lead author on the new study. “We might be able to find out what’s going on in the ocean.”The awareness that there might be a plume arrived gradually: first in pictures taken from the Hubble Space Telescope that seemed to suggest something strange was happening, and then through further, clearer Hubble pictures. One of those later sets of images sent Jia and his team back to the data – which already been collected all the way back in 1997, from a spacecraft that set off in 1989.“We already had the data  we had a flyby over this region,” he says, and the scientists resolved to “look more carefully at the data we have”.It worked. “In fact, when we look at the data more carefully – at the closest approach to the plume, we did detect strange changes which had not been explained before in the past,” he says.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceNasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

These two pieces of information immediately stood up – seeming to tell us that this minimal signal is being produced by a localised source, of particles.”In scientific terms, the team had a very good hunch that something was going on. But they needed to prove it, so they used extensive computer modelling to work out whether the data lined up with what would be be expected if there were a plume – and it did, with what Jia calls “stunning” precision.That’s why, thought the data is fairly old, the discovery could never have been made at the time. Only with a hunch, and brand new modelling techniques, could scientists make sense of it.“Twenty years ago, you might have had the idea that this was related to the plume,” he says. “But the models of the time wouldn’t allow you to draw that conclusion – we’d have to wait for better images from future missions.”The Cassini mission to Enceladus (which Jia was not involved in) has already given scientists an understanding that they can bring to other plumes.“The knowledge that has been developed on the Enceladus missions and the studies gives us a very good idea about, if you do have water plumes in space, how would that change the magnetic and the plasma environment?”One of the central disappointments of the Cassini mission was that much of what it learnt about Enceladus suggested this strange moon was worthy of much more study – but its mission was imminently coming to a close. That is not the case with Europa. Both Nasa and the European Space Agency are gearing up to send missions to Jupiter and the system that orbits around it.The ESA hopes to send its Juice mission to Jupiter’s moons in 2022 – and it will look at the other moons that are thought to have large oceans hiding beneath their surfaces, Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Europa. Nasa’s Europa Clipper mission is being prepared for launch the same year.“If plumes exist, and we can directly sample what’s coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,” said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.“That’s what the mission is after. That’s the big picture.”  Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsThe two spacecrafts will be very well prepared for finding the plume if they do: they will be carrying a whole host of instruments that will be perfect for coming to understand whether the strange world would have the ability to host alien life. They will also be carrying radars that can see down beneath the ice to help us learn more about where the plume is coming from – and also about the mysterious watery world that it is erupting up and out of.“Habitable conditions require a certain balance of chemical elements: on Earth, life doesn’t want it to be too acidic, too alkaline, though there are a range of conditions in which life could potentially exist,” says Leigh Fletcher, senior research fellow in planetary science at the University of Leicester.“The more favourable it is, the more likely it is they would be there.”We’ve already had a go at some of this, on Enceladus, where we were able to detect the so-called building blocks of life. Such a discovery doesn’t prove there is aliens hiding in our own solar system, but it does suggest they could be.The time around, on Europa, we’re going to get an even better look.“The Cassini mission was able to characterise in exquisite detail what is happening on Enceladus,” says Fletcher. “I would say that has been our testing ground, with a spacecraft that was based on 1980s, 1990s technology.“Now we know what we’re looking for in the Europa environment. It’s been a fantastically useful thing.”He adds: “One wonders if we ever went out to Saturn and Neptune, with their icy moons, would we be able to see these plumes? These places are barely explored.“It shows that this geophysical activity – this activity in a place where you would expect it to be dead – is happening, and things are changing, today.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I happily pay £40 a year for MoT safety check on my classic.Motor journalist Jonny Smith, who posts videos on Twitter as @carpervert, also opposes extending the exemption, which previously applied only to cars built before 1960.“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” he said. “It’s a good time to familiarise yourself with a car – sometimes you don’t know what jobs need doing, you need a second opinion.”The Department of Transport said the effect on road safety was “small” and claimed that there was no specific evidence of any risk from vehicles of historic interest.“The government gave significant consideration to the issue of any potential impact on rates of death and serious injury on the road,” said the Department of Transport.“The MOT failure rate and the number of people killed and seriously injured in accidents involving vehicles over 40 years old are both lower than those for newer vehicles.“We consider the element of risk arising from taking vehicles over 40 years old out of the testing regime is small.”The new MOT rules are also expected to increase confusion because of the lengthy list of exemptions and caveats.If classic cars have been “substantially changed” then the exemption does not apply – unless original parts are no longer available or the alterations were made to improve efficiency and safety.The exemptions also do not apply to older buses and commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.The new MOT is here! Check here for details – https:t.coE1ZMKAbpb6 pic.twitter1JrrXqubY5Other changes to the MOT coming into force on 20 May mean that diesel vehicles will fail if smoke of any colour comes from the exhaust.Faults will now be categorised as either dangerous (fail), major (fail) or minor (pass), with new checks for tyre pressure, brake fluid, brake pads, headlight washers, and reversing and daytime running lights.There have also been some changes to the annual test for heavy goods vehicles, with the removal of exemptions for mobile cranes, breakdown vehicles, tower wagons and road construction vehicles.Motorists can be fined up to £1,000 for driving without a valid MOT.RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: “It is important everyone quickly gets to grips with the changes to the MOT, and that test centres and garages do a good job of explaining the new fault categories so motorists understand correctly the severity of faults with their vehicles.“Changes to the MOT that make vehicles using our roads safer are undoubtedly a positive step so we hope that testers everywhere interpret and apply the new rules fairly and consistently. The last thing we want to see is a lowering of MOT standards and an increase in the number of unroadworthy vehicles on our roads.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You\u0027ve said it?Barry Gardiner describes key part of Labour\u0027s Brexit plan as b******s”Which Barry Gardiner is the truth? The one that speaks in private or the one that is on television now?“Mr Gardiner added: “Sometimes you have conversations in private, and the reason they are held in private is because you can advance thinking and you can actually then try and, if all you ever do is stick by the given line, you\u0027d never actually advance it because you\u0027d never discuss anything with people - that\u0027s the reason for holding things in private.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesWorkers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

Referring to the publication of the commission’s report, she added: “I think that’s quite an important moment, because if you think about the last couple of years in the UK it has been very much a debate about how we cope with the damage of Brexit.“What I think Scotland now has the opportunity to do is look at how we seize the opportunities that lie ahead, so a debate based very much on ambition and hope not a debate that\u0027s based on despair, which is how the Brexit debate so often feels.”However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the report demonstrated that the union “remains under threat”.Writing in the Financial Times, she claimed that it was “unlikely” that the latest drive would be met with enthusiasm, but warned against “complacency” and “indifference”.“As long as our future relationship with the EU is in flux, it would be foolish to assume that the current trends on Scotland remaining in the UK will hold and that the threat of separation has gone away,” Ms Davidson said.“The SNP is in power north of the border and will use that clout to drive a wedge between Scotland and the rest of the country. So we unionists must work hard to bolster our case for the union.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard added: “The idea that a separate Scotland would seek to use the pound without a central bank behind it is a recipe for instability and is the economics of dereliction. We would give up our say over interest rate policy, exchange rate policy and inflation.“Scotland does not need, and the people of Scotland do not want, this tired argument again. The SNP should recognise that, and focus instead on jobs, schools and hospitals.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

US investigators have accused Mr Najib\u0027s associates of stealing and laundering $4.5bn (£3.3) from the fund, some of which allegedly landed in Mr Najib\u0027s bank account and was used to buy a $23m pink diamond necklace for his wife. Ms Rosmah is known for her lavish spending on designer handbags, watches and jewellery when she travels abroad. Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money. The 92-year-old, who was once Mr Najib’s mentor, was prime minister for 22 years until 2003.

The US legislation allows the targeting of Russian state personnel who are deemed to have been involved in Mr Magnitsky’s death.The UK parliament is in the process of passing a version of the Magnitsky Act under which Russian nationals responsible for human rights violations as well as engaging in activities against Britain such as the Salisbury poisoning can be prosecuted.The Foreign Affairs Committee points to the London flotation of EN+ an energy company part owned by VTB, a Russian state-owned bank which has been sanctioned by the US and EU. EN+ was owned by Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch who is close to Mr Putin, who has since stepped down from the board of the company in an attempt to lift American sanctions.The report charts how, just days after the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack, the Russian government was able to raise £3bn in Eurobond issuance and the Russian energy multinational Gazprom PJSC made a £500m sale followed by the Russian embassy in London tweeting “business as usual”.The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill is currently in the final stages of passing through the Commons after going through the Lords. The MPs state: “We welcome the bill’s broad definition of the purpose of sanctions regulations, which will give the government the power to introduce sanctions for a range of reasons...” But the MPs want a register of overseas owners of properties in this country to be brought forward from the proposed date of 2021 and naming and shaming of iniduals “comparable to the US Magnitsky List” to be made public and updated by the Foreign Office.The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeThe committee’s chairperson, Conservative MP Tom Tugdenhat, said: “We must be united in our efforts to match rhetoric with action – in the City, through government policy and among allies in the US, G7 and EU. We call on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to set out a coherent strategy on Russia that clearly links together the diplomatic, military and financial tools that the UK can use to counter Russian state aggression.”The report, however, does not reveal any new information about Russian money and corruption in the UK, drawing instead on existing public material, and statements by journalists, academics and researchers. There is a degree of scepticism about whether Theresa May’s government will rush to investigate and prosecute on this issue near future laws which already exist to do so have not been much used.Successive British governments have actively encouraged rich foreigners to come to this country and a slew of prosecutions, which, to apply the law equitably, would mean targeting of other nationalities as well as Russians is likely to result in money being moved out, capital flight, at a time of economic uncertainty and trepidation following Brexit.Widespread international support for further punitive action is also unlikely. The British government has suspended senior level interaction with Moscow, but other Western states have not. Although a number of allied countries expelled Russians working under diplomatic accreditation following the Skripal attack, contact has continued as normal at the highest level.Angela Merkel has just met Mr Putin in Sochi where topics under discussion included Nord Stream 2, a project to pipe Russian gas to Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron will meet Mr Putin in St Petersburg this week, and the populist coalition due to form Italy’s next government has stated that it will lift sanctions placed on Russia over Ukraine.In the US, Donald Trump – under investigation over claims that Moscow helped to put him in the White House – recently signed a new set of congressional sanctions on Russia, only after resisting doing so for months. And although America threw out 60 Russian diplomats over the Skripals, the US president is reported to have claimed subsequently that he had been misled into expelling a far larger number than he has intended.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

This is something which should be open to them, after all we keep being told that the UK is a country of laws.”Mr Yakovenko wanted to stress that although the British government had chosen to break off high level liaison, other heads of state have maintained “links which are so essential” in the troubled international political climate.

It will make recommendations on monetary policy as well as the range of transitional cost and benefits associated with independence.Reports have suggested the commission will back the creation of a Scottish currency.Asked about the timing of a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon told ITV\u0026rsquos Peston on Sunday: \u0026ldquoOnce we get some clarity, which hopefully we will in the autumn, about the Brexit outcome and the future relationship between the UK and the EU then I will consider again this question of the timing of an independence referendum.

The Commission\u0026rsquos plan would see Scotland continue to use the pound on the day of separation but on an unofficial basis.

charming prince has married Meghan Markle, we take a look at his former flames, new title and just why he is called Harry when his name is actually Prince Henry...The flame-haired prince is 1.86m (or 61 feet) tall, and was born Prince Henry of Wales on September 15, 1984, and is 33 years old.Hes the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana.Following his marriage to Meghan Markle on May 19, 2018, the Prince assumed his new title as the Duke of Sussex.Harry served in the Army for 10 years, undertaking two tours of Afghanistan and rising to the rank of Captain.Now he is focusing his time on his charity work and promoting causes such as the Invictus Games as well as being more open about mental health issues.At the time of his birth, he was third in the line to the throne but will be sixth in line after his father, his elder brother Prince William, and Kate and Wills children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, and the couples third child Prince Louis.Prince Harry’s full name is Henry Charles Albert David, and he is styled as His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.He uses Wales in lieu of a traditional surname as was referred to as Captain Harry Wales when in the military.The Queen officially gave her consent for his wedding to Meghan Markle, releasing a statement using the couple’s real names.It said: “My Lords, I declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between My Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle, which Consent I am causing to be signified under the Great Seal and to be entered in the Books of the Privy Council.”Prince Harry needed her permission to marry under the Succession to the Crown Act.The prince also attained the rank of Captain in 2011, working his way up from Cornet, or Second Lieutenant in 2006, to Lieutenant in 2008.In November 2016, Kensington Palace confirmed the Suits actress was the Princes girlfriend, with a statement saying Harry was concerned for her safety.Harry and Meghan were spotted hand-in-hand for the first time in February 2017, while out on a date in London soon after.On May 6, 2017, Meghan made her first public appearance as royal girlfriend when she proudly watched Prince Harry playing polo in Berkshire and both Harry and Megan attended the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews in May.It was announced on November 27, 2017, that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were engaged.The couple tied the knot at St Georges Chapel, at Windsor Castle, on May 19.Prince Harrys mum Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.Speaking to Newsweek, he recalled the decision — made on his behalf — for him to follow his mum Diana’s coffin after her death.Harry said: “My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television.“I don’t think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances.”Harry has also previously revealed he battled with depression following his mums tragic death.He said he “shut down all his emotions” for two decades after losing his mother Princess Diana.The Prince admitted he had been close to a breakdown, sought therapy and took up boxing to combat frustration.According to The Richest, Prince Harry has an estimated net worth of around £40m.This includes both investment income and his inheritance.When he turned 30 in 2014, the prince inherited a trust fund of roughly £12m from his mother Diana.Both Harry and his brother, Prince William, inherited their late mothers estate.Camilla was linked to Prince Harry in July 2014 when it was reported they had locked lips.The Sun described the moment at the time, saying Harry had been spotted “in a clinch” with the Scottish lass while they were both at Tonteria nightclub in Sloane Square – shortly after he split from then-girlfriend Cressida Bonas.Asked on Love Island by fellow contestant Sam Gowland if she had dated Prince Harry, Camilla said: “Honestly, a lady never tells.”It has since been revealed that Camilla dumped Prince Harry over her fears of being rejected by him.A source told Now magazine: “Harry thought she was amazing and seemed to want something serious, but she refused to open up to him through fear of being rejected.“It was Camilla’s reservations that stopped their romance from going anywhere.”His other exes include a Burberry model, an X Factor singer and a Strictly Come Dancing starlet.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004074715332.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry diverse wedding sun says","story":"With the mix of old and new, tradition and modernity, British reserve and American enthusiasm, todays ceremony may have been the most important, ground-breaking Royal wedding ever.It would have been inconceivable just decades ago for a mixed-race American actress to walk down the aisle, mostly unaccompanied, to join the Royal Family.And who could ever have thought that Meghan’s mother, the dignified Doria Ragland, would stand arm-in-arm with our future king, Prince Charles, atop the West Steps of Windsor Castle?Harry was resplendent in a military uniform he has earned many times over.The talented, independent, headstrong Meghan looked magnificent.In their snatched conversation we saw a couple deeply in love, and we couldn’t be more thrilled for them.It was a day that will live long in the memory — and was a wonderful symbol of the country we have become.Proud of our history.

There is more to be done. One wedding will not change that.But yesterday we saw a Britain, and a Royal Family, that has moved into a new era.Princess Diana would have loved it.Nothing would have amused her more than how unconventional some parts of the ceremony were, or pleased her more than the number of hard-working charity staff who were invited to join in.The forget-me-nots in Meghan’s bouquet, Diana’s favourite flower, were a touching tribute. The Queen looked at once the distinguished Head of State we are used to and a doting grandmother.This was Britain’s biggest moment on the global stage since the opening of the London Olympics.Just as we did that night, yesterday we revelled in our heritage but announced that we were looking forward to an even brighter future.We wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex the happiest of lives together.Here’s to them and our Great Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She could easily have become trapped in the web of regal traditions.But Meghan navigated the intricacies with aplomb to pull off the most contemporary and delightfully multi-cultural royal wedding Britain has ever seen.There was a gospel choir, a bride’s mother with a nose stud and a star-studded guest list that was far more Soho House than Buck House. And of course, the aforementioned preacher Michael Curry.He milked his moment at the pulpit with a relentlessly repetitive call to love that went on . . . and on . . . and on, and clearly tickled some royals so much they looked fit to burst.The younger, modernising royals are now regarded more as celebrities than figureheads and this was a highly public melding of the old and new.After all Meghan, 36, is a divorcee with life experience, not some privileged ingenue straight out of finishing school.In Suits, the US telly series she starred in, her character married in a dress Meghan herself chose and described as “classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for”.The same could be said of yesterday’s creation by British designer Clare Waight Keller.In a nod to history, Meghan topped it with Queen Mary’s 1932 diamond bandeau tiara.And her “glam squad” of make-up artists, hairdresser, eyebrow shaper and skin guru worked their magic to accentuate a naturally radiant glow without looking overdone.She walked into the chapel alone, a break with form spun as a “bold, feminist statement” but really borne from sad necessity by her father’s absence.Meghan passed her Suits co-stars and the majority of the other celebrity guests in the Nave — what might be described as the cheap seats. Even Patrick J Adams, who played Suits love interest Mike Ross, was there.Yet curiously, celebrity royalty George and Amal Clooney were placed in the Quire alongside the Royal Family. Go figure.As Meghan reached halfway, she took the arm of her now father-in-law Prince Charles.He was to “accompany” her to the altar, rather than “give away” the woman who, let’s face it, he’s only just getting to know. For Charles the last-minute role was perhaps a godsend, placing him centre stage where the presence of his ever-strong mother might have eclipsed him.Not to mention the ghost of his ex-wife, always painted as the touch-feely parent to his seemingly more remote style.For, although it’s been 20 years since Diana’s death, how could anyone in the same situation not think of their mother and muse and how she would have savoured being there?And how could even the ­hardest of Republican hearts not have felt a small pang of regret she wasn’t?After all, in the middle of it all was the very human story of a young man who stole the nation’s hearts when forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at the tender age of 12.On his engagement, Harry was asked what Diana would have thought of Meghan. He smiled and said: “They would have been thick as thieves. I think she would have been over the moon — jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends with Meghan.”Indeed she would. Diana always took great pains to make sure her sons knew not everyone’s life was as privileged.So she would have adored Harry’s choice of bride for her normality and independence.He could have had his pick of socialites but he chose a normal woman who has grafted and earned everything she has.The downside is that, unlike poshies who are as badly behaved as the rest of us but keep it to themselves, Meghan’s unedited life is ripe for scrutiny.Diana would have understood and done her utmost to support her. In addition, the media-savvy Princess of Wales would have brought Meghan’s father into the fold weeks ago, knowing a mix of estranged family and lack of disposable income is a potentially damaging cocktail.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKBut all that was forgotten yesterday as Meghan’s 61-year-old mother Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher, watched her daughter (who she calls “flower”) from a front-row pew, compellingly regal in her solitude.Meghan is reportedly maternal herself apparent during their engagement interview, throughout which she guides Harry rather than the other way round.In Angela Levin’s book Harry: Conversations with the Prince, she quotes historian Dr David Starkey as saying: “She mothers him a bit, but he needs it and some women like to do it.”Harry says his mother’s death left him in total chaos and Levin feels his “air of vulnerability and sadness” has brought out Meghan’s mothering instinct.Good. In return, it’s plain to see she has Harry’s unconditional devotion, and that they’ll make fine parents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Except it’s not, of course. There were hours, days, months of speculation, flannel and rumour in the build-up to my favourite Royal Wedding, partly thanks to the performance of Meghan’s dad, Thomas Markle.Box-to-box, that bloke, and he left a gaping, unmentionable hole at yesterday’s ceremony which Dermot O’Leary, Kirsty Young, Huw Edwards and none of the enormous BBC team could hope to fill with their endless blether.Nor, for that matter, could celebrity guests George Clooney, James Corden (what was he doing there?), David Beckham or Victoria Beckham, who had a right face on her.But at least the famous faces stopped — for a few seconds — the dress speculation, which reached a peak of non-information before midday when Dermot threw to reporter Tina Daheley, at Cliveden House, wondering: “Has she spotted the merest hint of a clue as to the dress designer?”“No.” She hasn’t.With ground intelligence like that, you felt relief when the ceremony started.‘Cos, yeah, I did think the Rev Michael was going to eat into the Cup Final, but the occasion itself turned out to be beautiful and funny.It was also touching to see not just the Duke of Edinburgh, but Doria Ragland lost in wonder at the British pageantry surrounding daughter Meghan.All too quickly the magic was over, though, and the idle speculation restarted.Like I said earlier.

So is her mother.Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.Another source told the newspaper: It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on.There is definitely a connection there. Meghans mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.Charles is said to have spent a lot of time with his son and Meghan choosing the music to be played at their service.The Royal Wedding has been dogged by Meghans family speaking out against her.She has faced criticism from her half-sister Samantha Markle, who claimed their dad Thomas was alone and upset in hospital following his surgery for a dangerous heart condition.And she also slammed claims Kensington Palace was helping him - revealing she had to wire him cash to survive.Meghans brother Thomas Markle Jr has also hit out at the former actress - telling Prince Harry not to marry her.He wrote an explosive open letter telling Meghan to call off the upcoming nuptials, blasting it as a fake fairy tale.But he has now backtracked on his scathing comments - branding it a moment of madness.Meghan and Harry married on Saturday in front of a celeb-filled congregation at St Georges Chapel in Windsor.The ceremony was a modern affair - with the couple hailed for their multicultural ceremony. Their nuptials featured a rip-roaring sermon from an American preacher and a moving rendition of Stand By Me by a black gospel choir.The loved-up pair gazed at each other during the ceremony, with Meghan wowing in her spectacular gown by designer Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy.She teamed it with a dazzling Mary Diamond Bandeau tiara – lent to her by the Queen.Meghan expressed the wish of having all 53 countries of the Commonwealth with her on her journey through the ceremony.Harry greeted his beautiful bride at the altar and told her: “You look amazing.”Meghan was walked down the aisle by Prince Charles — standing in for her absent father Thomas.Harry, 33, who had nervously fiddled with his cuffs while waiting, turned to Charles and said: “Thank you, Pa.”They followed the ceremony with the evening reception in a £300,000 glass marquee in the grounds of Windsor Castle paid for by Prince Charles.Harrys dad left guests in stitches with a speech about changing his nappy, while the groom delighted everyone when he referred to Meghan as his wife.Jubilant guests were later treated to an incredible firework display that could be seen for miles around Windsor as the Royal Wedding was brought to a close."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004074535051.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle and prince harry to delay honeymoon and begin royal duties with charles 70th birthday event on tuesday","story":"The happy couple are delaying their travels for a series of royal engagements as a further break from tradition sees them getting straight back to work.Harry and Meghan have been tipped to go to a dazzling array of exotic locations for their honeymoon including Botswana, Hawaii, Mexico and the Caribbean.Prince Charles’ 70th birthday patronage garden party at Buckingham Palace will be the first event they attend as the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex on Tuesday.Last night Charles reportedly had wedding guests rolling in the aisles with his speech after cracking a joke about changing Harry’s nappy.The outdoor event marks the heir to the thrones milestone birthday -

The Prime Minister would trounce any challenge.We are four points ahead of Labour and the PM is miles ahead of Corbyn.And another said: I doubt the PM would lose a vote of confidence.Many MPs think a fresh leadership battle could risk a less popular leader replacing Theresa May, and even throw up the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn getting into Downing Street - and wouldnt ever take that risk.But if another poll were to take place this year, you can guarantee Brenda from Bristol wouldnt be a happy lady.Her hilarious response to news of the snap election went viral when she told a reporter: Oh for Gods sake, honestly I cant stand this, she cried.The retired secretary was inundated with offers of interviews following her first appearance on screen., when she summed up the mood of the nation.But the reports came just days after Mrs May faced a backlash among some Brexiteers over her plans to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU after 2021.Ministers have thrashed out the compromise as an alternative to Brussels’ backstop proposal, which would see Northern Ireland stay in the Single Market and Customs Union.But it is likely to be immediately rejected by Eurocrats, who will insist the UK must extend the whole transition if it cannot find another way to avoid a hard border.Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg condemned the idea last week as perpetual purgatory and others have said we would be better off with no deal at all with the EU if we were to be tied to a customs union."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407713934.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"german ww2 mine washes up on beach of brit holiday favourite bognor regis","story":"The large metal device measures, which is about 6ft long and is thought to weigh about 1,000kg, was found just yards away from sands popular with sunbathers.Emergency crews  - which alerted local residents - said it was now likely the bomb would be towed out to sea and detonated.It was discovered on a sheltered beach near holiday homes and emergency services descended to work out how to deal with it safely.The beach was evacuated and nearby residents were told to stay indoors and keep as far away from the beach, while staying in their own homes, as possible.The bomb washed up on the sand and pebbles near East Drive on Saturday evening.A resident who lived nearby said: I had a firefighter knock on the door and told me not to go outside and to sleep at the back of my house until they deal with it.They said something about a controlled explosion being carried out later today (Sun) when the tide was back in.Its amazing that these bombs are in the sea for decades and then all of a sudden end up on a beach.Sussex Police and the countys firefighters were on the scene and it was understood they were in contact with the military to discuss how to dispose of the  explosive device.Selsey Coastguard said it had been drafted in to maintain the cordon in place around the device on Elmer Beach.A spokesman said: This is an ongoing incident please avoid Elmer Beach as the area is closed and a large cordon is in place with Police presence while E.O.D.

She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then everyone danced, which really kicked off the party.”The bride’s US heritage was marked with the boozy American university drinking game beer pong, where players throw table tennis balls into cups of beers which their opponents then have to consume.The reception insider said: “Sere­na Williams played beer pong like it was tennis. Everyone had so much fun with it, there were even fireworks.”Charles and wife Camilla are thought to have left the party at Windsor’s Frogmore House before the celebrations became really wild.The source said: “Prince Charles and Camilla headed off at about 10.30pm, leaving the younger ones to party.It started to close down at about midnight to 1am — then people headed off to London, although some stayed.”Hollywood superstar George Clooney, 57, whisked Meghan away for a dance and also took Kate Middleton for a twirl, it was claimed.Pork belly and Pol Roger champagne was served. There was festival-themed food, with burger nibbles and bespoke cocktails.The source added: “There was a glass marquee for the dinner, festival-themed stalls and bars outside, with different themed drinks.“There were burger bar stalls, whiskey bars, candy floss, games to play, acts performing and a DJ with a dance floor.There was a gin vermouth cocktail created for Charles and Camilla, who are both massive gin fans apparently.”Cars were supplied by Jaguar Land Rover and there were also VIP buses with tinted windows to ferry guests around.The Sun revealed guests were also offered a cocktail called When Harry Met Meghan — a rum-based drink with a hint of ginger ale.The source confirmed: “That also went down a storm. Everyone found it hilarious.”The black-tie evening party was a sit-down dinner for 200 people.To provide the food, Harry and Meghan had hired Clare Smyth, Britain’s top chef and the first woman to hold three Michelin stars.Guests were told to “dress to the nines” for a night of “old-fashioned glamour and gallons of champagne”.Celebrity DJ Sam Totolee, who was hired by Rod Stewart and Uma Thurman for their wedding receptions, was on the decks.Actor Idris Elba also took a turn at DJ’ing, with a playlist filled with soul classics, 1960s R\u0026ampB and 1980s dance hits.As guests arrived at the evening party, they were asked to hand in their phones to prevent any ­unauthorised videos or pictures.In a striking break with royal tradition, Meghan gave a speech in which she thanked Prince Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a “warm welcome” into the Royal Family.Harry also gave a “rip-roaring” speech and said he looked forward to “spending the rest of my life” with Meghan.But it was brother William, 35, who brought the house down ­during a joint speech with Harry’s best pal Charlie van Straubenzee.They teased the groom about his thinning hair and told Meghan she was “the best thing that had ever happened to Haz”.One guest said: “William managed to strike just the right balance between hilarious and solemn.“He did mention their late mother, Princess Diana, and said how proud she would have been of her younger son.He said he was proud of Harry too and welcomed Meghan as the sister he never had and the best thing that had ever happened to Haz.“But when he and Charlie got going, it was hilarious.They teased Harry about his growing bald patch and Wills said it would become as bad as his. It was some bash.”Celebrity guests included George Clooney and wife Amal, actress Priyanka Chopra, plus Meghan’s best friend Jessica Mulroney with her husband Ben.Society party planner Alexander Seamus Fitzgibbons — who arranged Wills and Kate’s evening do in 2011 and Pippa Middleton’s wedding — organised the bash through his company Fait Acompli.They worked with Gordon Ramsay protégée Clare, who runs her own restaurant in London’s Notting Hill, where dinner can cost £150 a head.Her specialities include crab and black truffle royale, Isle of Mull scallops, Scottish venison and Mont-Blanc pain perdu.Bleary-eyed celebs nursed epic hangovers yesterday after the knees-up — including actress Meghan’s on-screen lover, Patrick J Adams, who gushed: “She stole the show.”Patrick, 36, 36, who plays Michael Ross in Suits, paid tribute to the new Duchess as he checked out of the luxurious Coworth Park hotel, where Wills and Harry had spent the night before the wedding.He said: “She looked beautiful and the day was amazing. We’re all so proud of Meg, she looked beautiful and stole the show.”Other celeb pals of the royal couple staggered out throughout the morning.James Corden left looking worse for wear, shouting at staff: “Let’s do it again at Christmas.”Suits actor Rick Hoffman, 47, was spotted singing a boozy rendition of Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean in a private section of the hotel.Jacinda Barrett, the wife of Gabriel Macht, 46 — another of Meghan’s co-stars — said: “Congratulations Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, what a beautiful and joyous day today was with your lovely family and friends.“I danced when Elton John sang, laughed at Prince Charles’ fantastic speech and am honoured to witness your commitment and love for each other, wishing you a long and happy life together.”She took her husband-to-be to several fittings at Kensington Palace but eventually settled on a slinky, lily-white Stella McCartney creation.A source said: “Meghan brought Harry along to get his seal of approval and was asking his opinion on everything she was trying on.“Harry wisely agreed that he liked everything and commented that fashion isn’t really his forte.”Amal Clooney, 40, and Oprah Winfrey, 64, also wore Stella McCartney for the Windsor ceremony.Jessica Mulroney, 38, whose three children were pageboys and bridesmaid, did not surface until the late afternoon.Prince Charles, 69, staged the glittering evening event for his son and Meghan, who had been given Princess Diana’s huge aquamarine ring as a wedding present from her husband.The Queen wore dark glasses yesterday as she attended Sunday morning service at The Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a day of history.And as the couple kissed on the steps of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, it felt like a new beginning.Here, we celebrate the day in words and pictures.It will always be remembered as the day worlds collided – and changed the course of the monarchy for ever.In St George’s Chapel, Windsor, surrounded by the long-buried kings and queens of England, British ceremony and American soul were put centre stage, blending centuries- old tradition and a forward-looking future.But for all the spectacle, for all the significance of a blue-blooded prince marrying a mixed-race divorcee, it boiled down to a lovestruck young couple who couldn’t keep their eyes off each other, who pledged themselves to each other like they just couldn’t believe their luck.As fiery Episcopal preacher Michael Curry later said in his soaring sermon on the power of love: “Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.”And didn’t we just.Across the country, in homes and pubs and parks, huddled around TVs or crowded in front of big screens, the British gathered to do what we do best.Armed with bottles of prosecco and supermarket sausage rolls, patriots prepared to swell with pride while cynics expected to laugh at those silly posh people and their stuffy old manners.In the event, of course, one and all were blindsided with emotion as a lovely young couple publicly declared their love.In Windsor the well-wishers stood 20 deep. They hoped to glimpse that cheeky prince who had lost his mum and lost his way, but who had grown into a fine young man — and had now found his soulmate.Bigwigs at the local tourist board must have been rubbing their hands in glee as pictures of the Berkshire town, looking resplendent in the dazzling May sunshine, were beamed around the world to a TV audience of 1.9billion.In fact, it was the kind of morning that couples who plan to marry in England — in the springtime — don’t dare to dream of.Perhaps Meghan is too American to have made the much-voiced wish of all British brides: “I don’t mind if it’s not sunny as long as it’s dry.”But if she did, her wish was more than granted.It must have been a relief to the VIP guests — and the handpicked normos who Meghan and Harry had invited to stand in the chapel grounds — that the weather had decided to put on its wedding best.It meant there were no umbrellas to ruin a fashion parade which would give the Oscars and the Met Ball a run for their money.The great, the good and the downright unexpected from the worlds of showbiz and sport joined bonafide aristocrats on the walk to the chapel, which was only missing a red carpet.Who on earth would have expected Chloe Madeley — daughter of Richard and Judy, and who insists she and rugby-player fiance James Haskell have sex every single day — to wangle an invite to a royal wedding?But there she was, alongside America’s very own version of the queen — Oprah Winfrey — as well as Idris Elba, Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford, James Blunt and the assorted cast of Suits.The male guests wore new suits, new shoes, new shirts, new ties. One, Mike Tindall, even had a new nose.The women had put as much thought into their hats as their outfits, and there were plenty of creations that you’d not have been happy to sit behind in the chapel for fear of them blocking your view.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie turned up in disappointingly subdued hats — determinedly sidestepping a repeat of the furore over the outlandish designs they wore to William and Kate’s 2011 nuptials.Instead, Eugenie looked like a Fifties air hostess, while Beatrice channelled a Tudor peasant.Chelsy Davy, who dated Harry on-off for seven years, wore the kind of facial expression you would expect of any woman about to endure the wedding of her ex.At least she had moral support from another of Harry’s former flames, Cressida Bonas, and the two girls apparently arrived together.Britain’s alternative royal couple — the Beckhams — were naturally in attendance, with Posh accessorising her funereal navy shift dress with the sort of scowl that only someone who hasn’t eaten a carb since 2001 can really pull off.To Victoria’s undoubted dismay, she and David were upstaged by one of the few celebrity couples who can eclipse the Beckham star power – George Clooney and wife Amal, who was resplendent in mustard yellow Stella McCartney.While the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Tom Hardy and even Sir Elton John had to sit behind the rood screen in the nave — which could be cruelly deemed the “cheap seats” — Amal and George were ushered into pole position in the quire, alongside the Royal Family.Was this Meghan, previously a relatively obscure star of a middling cable drama, pulling off the ultimate power move to cement her new status on the Hollywood A-List?As the guests took their seats — some more quickly than others, with Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson working the room like Tom Cruise — Meghan was preparing for the most nerve-racking drive of her life.Nine miles away at sumptuous Cliveden House, she was folding herself into the Queen’s 1950 Rolls-Royce Phantom IV, alongside her mum, Doria Ragland.When she was a youngster voraciously devouring Andrew Morton’s book on Princess Diana, or posing on the railings outside Buckingham Palace aged 15, could Meghan ever, even in her wildest moments, have imagined it might lead to this?When she was toiling to get a foot in the door in the acting profession, constantly boxed in by her so-called “ethnically ambiguous identity” — could she have dreamed that one day she’d be one of the most famous women in the world?Who knows what went through her head on the 26-minute drive to the chapel, and who knows what she may have said to her mum, who had raised her alone and who was at her side as she has always been?All we got was a glimpse of Meghan’s veiled face, looking remarkably composed as she waved to the crowd.Her American dream was about to come true — proof you really can be anything you want.Meanwhile, back at the chapel, Meghan’s beloved was arriving — in a laughably understated people carrier.Harry and best man Wills piled out — it really is impossible to get out of one of those cars elegantly — and the crowd whooped at the first glimpse of them in their dashing Blues and Royals uniforms.Harry looked nervous, but seemed to relax a little when his brother joked: “My trousers are too tight.”Those who remember the same princes as solemn young boys, walking grief-stricken behind their mother’s coffin, will have thrilled to see their easy intimacy as grown men, born from supporting each other through so much. Diana would have been delighted.With William and Harry in their seats at the front of the chapel — William keeping up a steady flow of whispered banter, just as Harry did when he was his best man — it was time for the mother of the bride to make her entrance.Doria, in mint green Oscar de la Renta, offset by her nose ring and dreadlocks, looked overcome with emotion as she took her place at the front of the church.Things don’t get much more surreal than arriving shortly before the Queen of England to watch your daughter marry a prince.But Doria also looked alarmingly alone – the only member of Meghan’s family to attend following a turbulent week which had ultimately resulted in the no-show of Meghan’s dad Thomas.Then Harry caught Doria’s eye and gave her a reassuring nod, and it was clear that she didn’t need anyone with her because she had a new family right here. That family could surely never have imagined that someone like Doria — a yoga teacher from California — would one day be their in-law.And yet here were Charles and Camilla — wearing what looked like a dead flamingo on her head — ready to cement that relationship.Finally, the Queen arrived, wearing lime green, accompanied by her ever steadfast husband, Prince Philip, who displayed the best of British stoicism by walking himself unaided down the aisle in his first public appearance since hip replacement surgery six weeks ago.Her Majesty was here to preside over the marriage of her grandson to an American divorcee — and it was down to another American divorcee that the Queen is the monarch at all.When Edward VIII fell in love with Wallis Simpson the Royal Family went into meltdown and the nation lost a king to exile and ignominy because tradition and the powers-that-be deemed it impossible he could marry such a woman.Yet here was Edward’s niece, 82 years later, ready to welcome Meghan with the closest the British upper class get to open arms.By her side was Philip, a man often seen as the old guard, but who has in fact spent his life fighting the whispering, back- stabbing traditionalists who had often treated him as an outsider too.If that parallel shows how far the Royal Family has come in embracing modern life, then they were about to get dragged further forward still by the arrival of the most modern bride in royal history.But first, the entrance of an adorable gaggle of page boys and flower girls, mainly children of Harry and Meghan’s closest friends — and of course four-year-old Prince George and his sister Princess Charlotte, three, who stole the show by sticking her tongue out at the crowds.The Duchess of Cambridge, generously in a cream Alexander McQueen coat dress she had worn three times before to make sure all eyes were on Meghan, was an earth mother in sharp tailoring as she ushered the children inside.Miraculously, the charming band of under-sevens all behaved themselves impeccably.Then finally — the moment the world had been waiting for.The bride stepped from her car and took away the collective breath of 1.9billion television viewers.After months of speculation, she revealed her gown to be the sort of showstopper that takes extortionate amounts of planning, time and money to make, but somehow manages to look effortless.Designed by British Givenchy boss Clare Waight Keller, the £200,000 ivory white gown demurely showed off Meghan’s figure to perfection.The look was completed with Queen Mary’s bandeau tiara, loaned to Meghan by the Queen, and a 16ft organza veil and train.It was embroidered with flowers from all 53 Commonwealth countries, as well as Meghan’s two favourite plants, the California poppy and wintersweet. Watching at home, her dad Thomas Markle declared: “My baby looks beautiful.”With her hair swept back in an elegant bun and a boat neck that showed off her delicate clavicles, Meghan had more than a little Audrey Hepburn about her. Which was appropriate, given that she was about to embark on the greatest screen moment of her life.Meghan was to become the first royal bride to walk herself down the aisle — before meeting Prince Charles half way for the final steps up to her betrothed. Before she set off on her momentous journey down the aisle, Meghan took a breath and gave a small smile, a picture of poise and composure.Who else in the world could have been so calm, so elegant, at such a moment?Watching Meghan’s progress on the arm of his dad, Harry – reddening with nerves – bit back tears, then met her eyes with a massive grin.As she reached the altar, Harry turned to Charles and murmured: “Thank you, Pa.” Then gazing at Meghan, he told her: “You look amazing, absolutely gorgeous.”Eagle-eyed viewers on Twitter were convinced that he added “I’m s***ting it” — easy to believe of a prince famous for his irreverent sense of humour.But it seems he actually told her “I missed you”, in reference to the night they had spent apart.Holding each other’s gaze, the air between Meghan and Harry crackled with chemistry that you could almost taste through the TV.It was as if they were the only people in the world — while across the globe, viewers at home found their eyes pricking with tears of joy.The tension was broken by the Dean of Windsor’s opening address: “The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives.”To their credit, the congregation managed to keep a straight face at the words “sexual union” — the rest of the British public, watching at home, were not so composed.There was further levity when the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, asked the couple if they knew of any reason why they could not marry. As is practically the law at British weddings, this provoked a wave of nervous laughter.Then it was time for the vows. Harry lifted Meghan’s veil to reveal her beautiful face, flawless in restrained make-up that showed off those trademark freckles, her eyes filled with wonder that this was actually happening.In the quintessentially English setting of St George’s Chapel, it felt almost incongruous — but wonderfully refreshing — to finally hear Meghan proclaim “I will” in her soft American accent.The couple promised to love, comfort, honour and protect each other with the sort of sincerity which would move even the hardest heart.If you weren’t bawling already, then surely the sight of Lady Jane Fellowes, sister of Harry’s beloved, lost mum Diana, arriving to deliver the reading would set you off.Taken from the Book of Solomon, the passage proclaimed that “love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave”.Then the vaulting voices of the St George’s Chapel Choir delivered Thomas Tallis’s If Ye Love Me, British choral tradition at its finest.But traditions are there to be broken, and that’s where the Most Reverend Michael Curry came in.Theatrical, fire-breathing and entirely unrestrained by time, the man chosen to give the sermon was about as un-British as they come.The first African-American bishop to lead the Episcopal Church in the US, 65-year-old Curry was reportedly recommended to the couple by the Archbishop of Canterbury.He had described him as a “brilliant pastor, stunning preacher and someone with a great gift for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.”This, it transpired, was an understatement.In a barnstorming address which ran to more than 13 minutes, Curry waxed lyrical about “harnessed fire” and “the redemptive power of love.” He quoted Martin Luther King and referenced justice, poverty and slavery in a room full of some of the planet’s richest and most privileged people.His passionate delivery was hailed on social media as the highlight of the service, but inside the chapel the faces of the senior royals, not used to this sort of unrestrained thundering, were a sight to behold.Beatrice and Eugenie got the giggles, Camilla and Charles seemed to be stifling laughter, and Kate looked like she had swallowed a wasp.The Queen was impassively stoney faced while Zara Phillips was open-mouthed.Meanwhile, the congregation were being wowed by a sublime cello performance from Sheku Kanneh-Mason.Young, gifted, British and black, and playing some of the most beautiful classical music ever written, Sheku epitomised how effortlessly Meghan and Harry had pulled together the old world and the new.The bride and groom returned for a rousing rendition of the National Anthem, then it was out into the dazzling sunshine as the choir sang the Etta James version of Amen/This Little Light Of Mine and the crowd whooped and hollered.On the steps of the chapel, underneath an Instagram-worthy floral arch, Meghan turned to her new husband and asked: “Do we kiss?” No prizes for guessing that he replied with an enthusiastic: “Yeah!”And just like that, there it was, sealed with a kiss — proof that fairytales really do come true. Everyone wanted a taste of the magic, and the newlyweds obliged with a thrillingly romantic carriage ride through the streets of Windsor, aboard the 13ft-long Ascot Landau.Meghan couldn’t quite believe the sea of people all there to wish them well, repeatedly mouthing “Wow.” Harry, meanwhile, told her: “I’m ready for a drink now.”It was a spectacular sight — the open-topped carriage, pulled by four Windsor greys and flanked by the household cavalry Blues and Royals.British pageantry at its best, but in typically British fashion most viewers were distracted by a rather lively looking horse at the front, which seemed ready to make a break for it.Thanks to the efforts of its rider, the horse’s behaviour remained just on the right side of disastrous.The feelgood atmosphere was infectious, with crowds singing “Harry and Meghan sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.”Those thousands of well-wishers may not have been invited to the wedding reception, but you can be certain they carried on the party for many hours to come.Meghan and Harry were headed for St George’s Hall state room in Windsor Castle, where they treated 600 guests to a spread of canapes including Scottish langoustines and croquettes of Windsor lamb.Charles gave a speech praising how Harry had grown into “a big man with a big heart”, while Harry provoked cheers when he introduced Meghan as “my wife.”In a speech that had his guests in stitches, Harry gently ribbed the Americans by warning them not to steal the swords, and implored them to leave quietly so as “not to wake the neighbours”.Speaking from the heart, he praised Meghan for “navigating everything with such grace” and added: “We make such a great team.”Few would disagree with that sentiment.Later, a privileged 200 friends and family were invited to an evening reception compered by James Corden at nearby Frogmore Hall, on the grounds of the Windsor estate.Harry and Meghan were pure Hollywood glamour as they made their journey to the do in an open E-Type Jaguar, she in stunning Stella McCartney halter neck gown and he in sharp tuxedo.Their ride is said to be the world’s most sought-after car, a blue 1968 model that has been converted to electric.With the number plate E190518 — the date of their marriage — it was the perfect transport for the world’s most sought-after couple.There was one guest missing from the day who Harry will surely have longed to be there, but she made her presence known nonetheless.Princess Diana would have loved the deeply personal touches the couple brought to their wedding, and the way they breathed new life into centuries of tradition.When Diana married into The Firm, the monarchy was still living in the past, and she was suffocated by the pomposity and stuffiness.Her legacy was to leave her sons with the thirst to modernise and humanise the institution they were born into, and that desire was writ large across this unique Royal Wedding.On his engagement to Meghan, Harry said that his mother and his fiancee would have been “best friends.”She may not have been there to share his joy at marrying Meghan, but Diana was there in spirit. Meghan and Harry — now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, thanks to new titles bestowed by the Queen — are back to reality tomorrow.They return to work undertaking their first royal engagement as man and wife, co-hosting a garden party at Buckingham Palace alongside Prince Charles.It may have been brief, but their wedding was the shining moment that we all needed amid the troubles and challenges of a world seemingly more divided than ever.For one glorious weekend we came together and felt good, celebrating the love and hope of two people at once so different to us, and so much the same.Across the country, on buses and in supermarket queues and in sunlit parks, it was all anyone could talk about.It was the same infectious cheerfulness and celebration of our common decency that Britain last experienced at the 2012 London Olympics.How strange that it took a royal wedding to prove that the values of tolerance and optimism are alive and well.Curry, ignoring his prepared text on the iPad in front of him, ploughed on undaunted.At one point he seemed to be coming to a close, saying “we’re gonna sit down, we gotta get y’all married” — before continuing for a further three minutes. Meghan liked it, though — she turned to Harry and mouthed: “Wow!”Just when you thought it couldn’t get less British, the address was followed by a spine-tingling rendition of Ben E King’s soul hit Stand by Me, by the London-based Kingdom Choir.The message was clear — Meghan and Harry intend to do things their way, and that includes looking forwards, and embracing Britain’s multicultural identity.Improbable as it may seem, Meghan and Harry are uniquely placed to do this. With Meghan, a proudly bi-racial woman, inside the fold, the Royal Family is finally starting to look a little more like the nation they represent.More than this, Meghan knows what it is to strive, to graft, to have a career and to have a marriage that doesn’t work, just like tens of thousands of Brits.Harry, while immensely privileged, is the most human face of the Windsors. He has known great personal tragedy but maintains his mother’s easy charm with ordinary folk.We’ve all watched him make very public mistakes — the booze, the hot-headed temper, the naked japes, the distasteful fancy dress.But it is precisely because of his flaws that Harry is our most beloved royal after the Queen — because it seems like he’s one of us.Together Meghan and Harry can make real changes — you need look no further than the rapt faces of the guests listening to the gospel choir to know this is true.Apart from former PM Sir John Major, who was appointed William and Harry’s special  after the death of Diana in 1997, and Winston Churchill’s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames — there on virtue of being a close family friend rather than his political career — there were no staid politicians in attendance.Instead, Harry and Meghan invited the representatives of causes they cared about, in a signal of what they plan to prioritise once they were married.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKThere was Karl Lokko, a former gang leader turned youth community activist, Suhani Jalota, whose Myna Mahila Foundation attempts to improve women’s menstrual health hygiene in India, and Dave Henson, who helped Harry build his Invictus Games.It is an exciting taste of things to come — and do not doubt the power of this extraordinary couple. When Harry publicly took an HIV test, self-testing increased by 500 per cent. The impact he and Meghan may have is boundless.But they are more than a power couple — they are starstruck lovers, too. Nowhere was this more apparent than at the moment they swapped wedding bands, when Harry tenderly stroked Meghan’s finger as he slipped a Welsh gold ring on it.The delight on their faces when the Archbishop finally pronounced them husband and wife would be familiar to giddy newlyweds everywhere.After Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer — Diana’s favourite hymn, which was played both at her funeral and at William and Kate’s wedding — Meghan and an emotional Prince Harry slipped off to sign the register.How they must have treasured those few private moments. All of us who had witnessed them unable to tear their eyes off each other were hoping they put the privacy to good use, by indulging in some passionate snogging.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have to be happy with who you are.”The Pope’s words signal a much more open and inclusive approach by the often restrictive faith – a move which will likely upset many conservative Catholics.The Vatican has neither confirmed nor denied the comments the Pontiff’s comments to Cruz.The Catholic Church teaches that gay sex – and all sex outside of heterosexual marriage – is a sin.This is not the first time Pope Francis’ comments have suggested a more open and tolerant attitude toward homosexuality.In July 2013, when responding to a reporter’s question about the existence of an alleged “gay lobby” within the Vatican, Pope Francis said: “If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?The Pontiff’s most recent remarks come as several high profile members of the clergy have sought to publicly make amends with gay Catholics, many of whom say they feel shunned an d unwelcome in the church.Juan Carlos Cruz was one of three former sex abuse victims from Chile who were summoned to Rome to receive an apology from the Pontiff for years of abuse endured by them as children.The victims described clerical sexual abuse as “an epidemic that has destroyed thousands of lives.”Initially, the Pope had been slow to realise the gravity of the crisis in Chile, at one point even coming to the defence of a controversial bishop linked to Father Karadima.However, he swiftly changed his stance after Vatican investigators presented him with a 2,300-page dossier documenting the sexual abuse of minors that had been covered up in Chile for decades.Last week, Chile’s 34 bishops offered to resign en masse over the abuse scandal, in an unprecedented move in the history of the Catholic Church."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407683714.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"couple raffle off 3m six bed house that they cant sell for 25 a ticket","story":"Mark and Sharon Beresford put the six-bed riverfront home on the market two years ago.But managing director Mark, 61, said: “It just didn’t sell.It seems people don’t have £3million to spend on a house at the moment.”The Beresfords, whose three kids have now grown up, built the glass and wood home near Ringwood, Hants, 11 years ago with German firm Huf Haus.It has seven reception rooms, its own cinema and a parking block.There are 250,000 tickets available but if fewer than 130,000 are sold by the July 31 draw, a cash prize will be given.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 62-year-old owns six super cars, and a car he does the shopping in, Birmingham Live reports.  He has built six garages for his luxury cars, and hires a man to wash them regularly.  Before his big win Tom was a lorry driver and owned a Ford Granada Mark 2 - with a dream of one day owning a supercar.  Tom, who was originally from Wednesbury but now lives in a luxury home in South Staffs, said: I do love my cars and winning such a large amount of money has enabled me to indulge my passion.  The first car was a Jaguar XJR which I bought 17 years ago when I first won the lottery. I still have that car now. Over the years I have bought more and more cars.

But it reminded some of one of his grandfather\u0027s famous gaffes.  The 96-year-old Prince Philip, who is still recovering from a hip operation he underwent roughly six weeks ago, was at the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel to see Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in a lavish and beautiful ceremony.  The Duke of Edinburgh is perhaps most famous for his history of gaffes and inappropriate remarks. Although he is thought to have been on his best behaviour alongside the Queen yesterday, that hasn\u0027t stopped one of his earlier remarks being dragged up again.  With Harry opening the door for the Duchess, politician turned comedian Gyles Brandreth reminded his followers on Twitter of what Prince Philip once reportedly said: If you see a man opening a car door for a woman, it means one of two things: it\u0027s either a new woman or a new car. In this case the woman was certainly a new wife and the car, while originally manufactured in 1968, has since been converted to electric power. The car is a concept model and the licence plate has a secret meaning.

Grace, now 16, avoided the bomb blast that killed 22. But Gaynor and Michael, of Dukinfield, in Tameside, were in its path. Gaynor, 48, suffered terrible injuries. Michael, 60, was left partially deaf. Grace told her mum she feels guilty they were hurt, not her. Here, Gaynor responds.. My darling Grace, I know you feel guilty about what happened that horrific night on May 22. I know you feel guilty that me and your dad were in the foyer waiting for you and suffered the full brunt of the blast. But I want to tell you, my darling little girl, that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I am forever grateful that it was me rather than you in that foyer, that it’s me who suffered the awful injuries and who saw the aftermath. It looked like a war zone. That image will never leave me and I am so thankful that you never had to see what I saw. The sight, and unforgettably awful sounds, of that night are still vivid but, instead of remembering the moment that destroyed so much, I try to recall the good and happiness beforehand.  I remember driving you and your friend to the concert and you were so excited, singing Ariana Grande songs. We dropped you off in the foyer and told you the spot next to the merchandise stall where I’d wait when you got out. You’d put on your new Ariana hoodie from one of the stalls. I remember you saying you were so excited you felt sick. Once we made sure you were OK, me and your dad had a meal in Manchester city centre then, later, I popped in to pick you up while he waited in the car. It was so busy. All the mums were chatting, some parents were dancing. Other mums were taking little girls out crying because they didn’t want to leave the concert before the end. I look back and think, “Thank God they left early”.  Then, around 10.20pm, I felt a tap on my shoulder and there was your dad. He’d come in to see if I was OK. I wish he had stayed in the car because, the next minute, it was total carnage. It was a noise I’d never heard before, so sharp, a sudden bang. I knew it was a bomb straight away. I felt an intense heat and flames flicking around my neck. Your dad had been blasted away from me but I could see him lying unconscious with his eyes open. I saw his eyes fix on me. I thought, “He’s dead”. As you know, Dad is a big 6ft fella and with all my might I pushed him up, shouting, “Michael, Michael!”. I was desperate for him to come round and eventually he did. Then I looked around. I don’t have words to describe what I saw. It was as if time had stood still. My brain could not absorb what I was seeing.  I am just so thankful that you never saw what I did, Grace, and you don’t suffer the same terrible flashbacks. My neck felt really hot and my legs were really cold. I knew something was wrong but all I could think about was you and how I was going to find you. I was hysterical, screaming your name. I thought, “If I scream loud enough, she’ll hear me”. All I could do was remind myself you had front row seats and hope desperately it meant you weren’t near the blast. I thought another bomb was going off. I was screaming to your dad that we had to get out. The next 45 minutes were the longest of my life. All the phones were down, we had no idea where you were.  I was frantic. Then a woman who helped you found my number in your phone and rang me to tell me you were safe at the cathedral. Seeing you and hugging you in that moment felt unreal, it was like being in a film. I cried, screamed and hugged you. I was so relieved and you sobbed in my arms. You wouldn’t stop clinging to me. Once I knew you were safe, I started to realise how bad my injuries were. At that moment I turned to your dad and said, “Michael, I really hurt”. And he said, “I know”. He rushed us to Tameside Hospital, where I was told by doctors I am the luckiest person to be alive.  Shrapnel had hit my neck, causing burns that spread to my face. It also pierced my hip bone, down my leg and through my back. If that piece of shrap\u0026shy\u0026shynel hadn’t hit my hip bone, I’d be dead. As you know, it’s been a long and slow recovery. I am still in a lot of pain in my leg and I had to get a graft on my neck, because the scar haunted me. It was the first thing I saw when I looked in the mirror and became a constant reminder of what happened to all those people. It must’ve been a reminder to you, too. But I am so grateful you haven’t had to go through the same pain as me, Grace. My confidence was completely shattered. We were all set to open my new dog parlour shop before the attack but I couldn’t face it for five months. But I had to make myself get on for you, Grace. I know you won’t talk to me about that night. You have refused counselling, unlike me and your dad, and you say you are fine whenever I ask you.  I know you didn’t want to come back to the Arena with us, which the counsellors said might help with the trauma. And it was tough. We saw the spot where your dad stood and there is a huge slab of concrete totally destroyed right next to where his head was. But I think of us as the luckiest people in the world. I know you have your online forum with some of the other girls there that night and I really hope you find comfort in speaking to them. Please remember, Grace, that I am so proud of you.

Twitter was awash with speculation on Saturday that the new Duchess of Sussex failed to show the respectful gesture to the 92-year-old monarch during the service in St George\u0027s Chapel. But new footage shows the 36-year-old did curtsy in a blink-and-you\u0027ll-miss-it moment. But TV crews decided that exact moment to cut to a wide angle shot and it was missed. Eagle-eyed fans who looked closely at the footage from the ceremony were able to spot the brief curtsy.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were wed yesterday in an extravagant and diverse ceremony which was watched across the world. The couple tied the knot at a packed St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with thousands of fans lining the streets of the royal borough town to celebrate the historic occasion. Meghan, who wore a stunning white Givenchy dress, has bent her knee to the monarch in the past.  But fans were quick to question if the occasion had got the best of Meghan and she forgot to curtsy as she left the chapel. Simone tweeted: Fellow British friends, can someone tell why Meghan didn’t curtsy to the Queen? George Whitsett wrote: Wasn’t Meghan supposed to curtsy the queen before leaving the church? Monicia Warner added: Any idea why there was no curtsy to the Queen?

The newlyweds will have a “mini-moon” celebration in the Republic of Ireland, according to sources, who say secret plans have been put in place. For Harry, 33, it will be his first visit to the Emerald isle - but Meghan, 36, has already visited as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014. The itinerary for the planned visit in June or July is only in the early stages - but it is believed the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will just stay for one night.   The trip could have added significance during a time of heightened tensions following Brexit negotiations and the UK’s relationship with Europe.  Meghan and Harry tied the knot in a dazzling wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, yesterday, which was watched by millions globally. But unlike many other couples, they have chosen to forgo a traditional honeymoon - instead, immediately selflessly dedicating their time to royal duties. Together, they will throw themselves into a hectic schedule and follow through with Meghan’s vow to “hit the ground running” after the wedding. The Queen, who attended the ceremony in a lime green coat, is said to be delighted at how the public has taken the latest royal couple into their hearts.  Meanwhile, courtiers have devised plans to use the new \u0027power couple\u0027 - who revealed their engagement last November - as super-envoys across the world. The Mirror understands Harry and Meghan will undertake a Commonwealth tour in October, taking in Australia - where the prince will open his Invictus Games - and New Zealand, as well as the islands of Tonga and Fiji. But touchingly, their first official engagement as husband and wife will be in honour of Harry\u0027s dad Prince Charles\u0027s 70th birthday on Tuesday.  Meghan is said to have been overwhelmed with the Prince of Wales’s dedication to making both her and her mother, Doria Ragland , feel at ease during the lead-up to the wedding, and his earnest act of walking her up the aisle.   Kensington Palace announced the happy couple will attend the Buckingham Palace garden party to celebrate the heir to the throne\u0027s milestone birthday - which falls in November - by recognising his patronages and military affiliations as well as others involved in charities supported by the royal. Last night, Meghan and Harry partied with 200 of their closest friends and family in privacy at their \u0027festival-themed\u0027 wedding reception at Frogmore House. They were expected to head home to their cottage in Kensington Palace\u0027s grounds before attending the birthday patronage celebration for Charles. Today, while the Queen attended church, there was no sign of the newlyweds.   Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s love affair with Africa   After the garden party, the couple will commit to a series of top level meetings with royal advisors to set out their plan for the coming year. The British Government, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, also hopes to cement ties with old friends and help smooth the path for trade. The pair - along with Charles and Camilla and William and Kate - will reportedly relish in their role to play a key role in “soft power”diplomacy for the UK. The destination of their official honeymoon is currently unknown.  However, some have predicted they might travel to Botswana, possibly to an exclusive safari camp which the couple visited in August last year.  Kensington Palace has always remained tight-lipped regarding the romantic break. But according to Reuters , Harry whisked Meghan away to the luxurious Mapula Lodge near the Okavango Delta to mark her 36th birthday in style.  There, the couple reportedly enjoyed a sunset cruise, early morning game drive and twilight dinner, with an onlooker telling the publication: They are like regular guys. They were just relaxed. You could see they were very happy together.  One royal source said countries like Botswana or Namibia - which also offers stunning wildlife and breathtaking scenery - could be top of the honeymoon list. Bookmakers Ladbrokes have seen a flurry of betting for the couple\u0027s honeymoon destination with Namibia emerging as the frontrunner at 2/1. Botswana - a close second at 4/1- is also a place the Duke loves and knows well. He even sourced the diamond in his bride\u0027s engagement ring from the country. Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding, which was broadcast live on TV and captivated millions, blended ancient English ritual with African American culture.

And Clooney, 57, also danced with the Duchess of Cambridge at the star-studded event in Windsor’s Frogmore House. But one of the world’s the sexiest men did not get his own way with all the women – Fergie snubbed him when he asked her to dance, much to the \u0026shyamusement of other guests.  Meghan’s dog Guy also had \u0026shyrevellers in fits as it caused chaos by running around the hall lapping up spilled food. Earlier, the couple declared their love for each other in short speeches. Harry told friends: “You are the people that make ‘me’ me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry. “Now I’m going to hand over to my far better half…”  Meghan ended her emotional speech by declaring: “I have found my prince.” She is also understood to have thanked the royals for welcoming her into the “firm” and her close friends for supporting her in the last few weeks. The couple chose Whitney Houston’s hit I Wanna Dance With Somebody for their first jive. One of the 200 guests said of the \u0026shyreception: “It wasn’t \u0026shytraditional in the slightest. They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop.”  Another added: “As we walked in there were ladies dressed in black, serving us fizz and Pimms, as well as canapes from the palace staff. “That bit was a little formal with a bit of a line-up led by Charles and Camilla, with Wills and Kate to one side and Harry and Meghan in the middle of it all.” But the guest told how fun took over formalities once the party got into swing, adding: “It was informal and a lovely atmosphere. “The whole evening had a really chilled, festival vibe.”  Guest Suhani Jalota, who founded Mumbai charity Myna Mahila \u0026shyFoundation that Meghan visited last year, told Glamour \u0026shyMagazine: “I think everybody thought she looked beautiful. I got to speak to Meghan at the reception, when she and Prince Harry were meeting \u0026shyeverybody one by one. “Even after she has become the Duchess of Sussex, she hasn’t changed. I gave her a hug, I \u0026shycongratulated her.” There were Madame Tussauds waxworks of Meghan and Harry at the event, which followed an earlier reception for all 600 wedding guests. At that event, the prince moved them to tears by saying of his wife: “We make a great team.”  Evening reception guests included David and Victoria Beckham, tennis star Serena Williams, James Corden, Idris Elba, Amal Clooney and actress Priyanka Chopra. Brother and best man William was there with wife Kate as well as Fergie’s daughters Beatrice and Eugenie. Elba is reported to have turned DJ as the wedding group danced to 80s and 90s hits. A DJ who slipped his business card to Harry during a visit to Brixton in South London, hinted that it worked and he secured the commission to play at the do. Jevanni Letford posted a photo of Windsor with the caption: “Calm before the excitement.” In honour of Harry’s time in the forces, the evening was lubricated by cocktails with military names such as the Apache, the Brimstone, the Rapier and the Hellfire. Guests were given slippers to wear when their feet were tired from dancing. Actress Troian Bellisario, wife of Meghan’s former on-screen husband Patrick J Adams in Suits, posted on Instagram: “How amazing is this? “Because these shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. \u0026shySlippers! I’m so ready.” Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy, who had been spotted on TV looking glum as he tied the knot, appeared in a better mood at the party. She was all smiles and was even seen embracing Meghan, who wore \u0026shyPrincess Diana’s aquamarine ring. After Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, left, guests were thought to have gone to an “after after party” at London’s Chiltern Firehouse. An insider said: “Harry and Meghan went about midnight, \u0026shyshattered and madly in love.”  But there was still time for a prank by William, who attached a ladder to the couple’s car. The guest said: “Apparently Harry fell off a ladder recently while changing a light bulb for Meghan and hurt his arm. So Wills tied a ladder to the back of the car, which nearly floored a few people.” Proud dad Charles gave a speech at the earlier reception at St George’s Hall in Windsor Castle.

And her beloved beagle proved to be one of the highlights of the night as he entertained guests at the royal wedding evening reception.  The pet pooch had revellers in stitches as he caused chaos, running all over the place lapping up any spilled canap\u0026eacutes. Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex, brought Guy to Britain with her last year when she relocated from her home in Toronto.  The decision was heartbreaking for Meghan as her other dog, Labrador-shepherd cross Bogart, was deemed too old to travel and had to be left behind. Meghan was also left devastated late last year when Guy reportedly suffered two broken legs. He was reportedly treated by TV supervet Professor Noel Fitzpatrick.  Prince Harry and Meghan told their closest friends of their love for one another at the late reception party after their spectacular wedding. Both of the newlyweds gave short informal speeches. Harry said how honoured he was to have such special people there with him. And he added: “You are the people that make me me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry.” Then he gave way to his bride Meghan with the words “now I’m going to hand over to my far better half.”  An excited Meghan spoke for about four minutes about the big day, before she ended with the most emotional words of the night, telling her guests: “I have found my prince.” Guests arrived at 6pm for the most relaxed event of the night. One guest who was there said: “As we walked in there were ladies dressed in black, serving us fizz and Pimms, as well as canap\u0026eacutes from the palace staff. “That bit was a little formal with a bit of a line-up led by Charles and Camilla, with Wills and Kate to one side and Harry and Meghan in the middle of it all.” But after that, the party became a lot more relaxed. The guest said: “It was all very very informal, and had a lovely atmosphere. The whole evening had a really chilled, festival vibe.” The newlywed couple took to the dance floor inside Frogmore House for the first dance to Meghan’s favourite - Whitney Houston’s classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody. “It wasn’t traditional in the slightest,” said the guest. “They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop.”  But Harry was not the most popular dance partner... that was one of the sexiest men on the planet, Hollywood star George Clooney who danced with both bride Meghan and her new sister-in-law Kate. But to the amusement of many guests, the very first woman George asked to dance, Fergie, the Duchess of York, turned him down. Meanwhile some of Harry’s closest friends including ex-Para Jaco van Gass who suffered life-changing injuries in Afghanistan and became a Paralympics cyclist, along with guests such as Emily Sheffield - former Prime Minister David Cameron’s sister-in-law, hardly left the dance floor. Many TV viewers had remarked during the day on a sour expression on the face of Harry’s former girlfriend Chelsy Davy as she watched him tie the knot with Meghan. But at the party, she was all smiles and even seen embracing Meghan.  Big names like James Corden and Idris Elba happily chatted to fans but the guest said David and Victoria Beckham were “really aloof”. In honour of Harry’s time in the armed forces, the evening was lubricated by cocktails with military names such as the Apache, the Brimstone, the Rapier and the Hellfire. To the amusement of guests Madame Tussaud’s waxworks of Meghan and Harry were on display in a side room which caused all kinds of hilarity and mistaken identity as the night went on.

But despite her fancy new name, the American actress won\u0027t actually be a British citizen for several years. Meghan has been granted Leave to Remain, an immigration status which means there\u0027s no time limit on her stay in the country and she\u0027s allowed to work and study without any restrictions. However getting citizenship is a bit more complicated.  Kensington Palace has said Meghan will go through the normal visa process like everyone else. A spokesman said: Ms. Markle has taken full legal advice on her right to remain in the UK and will be fully compliant with all requirements at all times. She will go through the normal visa process. Ms. Markle intends to become a British citizen going through the normal process, which will take a number of years. The palace would not comment on whether Meghan is being given any special treatment because she is now a royal.  According to the government\u0027s website, there are a number of criteria you must meet in order to apply to become a citizen. These include:  You must be over 18 You must be of good character You\u0027ll have to continue living in the UK You\u0027ll have to prove you have a good knowledge of English You must have lived in the UK for five years before the Home Office gets your application. You can\u0027t have spent more than 450 days outside of the UK in those five years You must not have broken any immigration laws while you were in the UK.    Meghan has given up her job as an actress and will take up royal duties alongside her new husband.  Like her sister-in-law Kate, she will probably do lots of charity work with causes close to her heart.

Climbing the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, she gave royal fans across the globe their first glimpse of the most anticipated wedding dress in history. The 36-year-old American chose Givenchy\u0027s British artistic director Clare Waight Keller, 47, to design the \u0026pound200,000 ivory-white gown. And the details of their top secret relationship has now been laid bare. Dashing across London in a baseball cap or beanie, Meghan and Clare ran a covert operation in the lead up to the big day.  The commission was so secret, the bride did not go to Paris to visit the French fashion house\u0027s headquarters, but instead met Clare at her Chelsea home. According to reports, Meghan would dress down and dart into the West London flat. The process began in January, when Meghan began looking through sketches with best friend Jessica Mulroney, who runs her own bridal business in Canada. Until yesterday, only five people in the world knew details about the dress - the bride, Jessica, Clare and two discreet assistants at Givenchy. Once a design was decided on, expert seamstresses got to work.  The veil took hundreds of hours to make as seamstresses religiously washed their hands every 30 minutes. The delicate fabric had to be kept pristine and flowers from 53 Commonwealth countries were to feature. The result was a three-quarter length, simple gown with an elegant boat neck and 16ft veil made from silk tulle. The focus of the dress is the graphic open bateau neckline that gracefully frames the shoulders and emphasises the slender sculpted waist, Kensington Palace said in a statement. The lines of the dress extend towards the back where the train flows in soft round folds cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza. The slim three-quarter sleeves add a note of refined modernity.  The gown was made of double bonded cady silk with a sweeping train. Edward Enninful, the editor of British Vogue, called the dress beautiful while bridal designer Raishma said the gown was an example of couture design at its most classic and timeless. It was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales, but one that placed the woman proudly front and center, Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic at The New York Times, wrote. It underscored Ms. Markle\u0027s own independence by divesting her of frippery, while also respecting tradition and keeping her covered up.  The well-kept secret over who would design the dress had kept royal fans and fashionistas guessing for months. Among the those cited as contenders were labels Ralph \u0026amp Russo and Burberry as well as designer Stella McCartney. Waight Keller, whose name has now been catapulted into the global spotlight, described the chance to work on the historic occasion as an honour.

The couple, who love camping under the stars in Africa, may regret putting off the honeymoon for royal duties.

Rhian Monteith’s simple idea could save the NHS tens of millions of pounds and bosses want it to go UK-wide. The 39-year-old drew up a list of 23 “frequent callers”– many lonely or with mental health problems – who had visited A\u0026ampE 703 times in three months. After a coffee meeting she mentored them, getting them to call her not 999. This cut their A\u0026ampE visits and ambulance call-outs in Blackpool by 90% and Rhian said: “I’m incredibly proud to see how my idea has grown.  “It shows, if you are armed with a phone and a high level of emotional intelligence, the difference you can have to people who need a hand up in life. “Every individual is put in contact with a person who cares about them, and stands with them in their time of need.” The High Intensity User scheme was scaled up to 300 patients in Blackpool over three years, saving \u0026pound2 million. It is now used in a fifth of the country and NHS England wants the rest to follow. In 2016 the cost across the NHS of the estimated 5,000 “frequent callers” – defined as calling five times a month or 12 times in three months – was put at around 3% of spending or \u0026pound53 million.

The hymn was his mother\u0027s favourite and the 33-year-old chose to include it as part of the ceremony as a tribute to Princess Diana , 21 years after it was sung at her funeral.   Prince Harry , who looked nervous as he walked into the chapel with his brother and best man Prince William , appeared to struggle with his emotions as his stunning bride walked up the aisle on her own - with her father too ill to attend.  But the new Duke of Sussex was again overcome with emotion as the touching hymn was sung. The song was performed at Diana\u0027s funeral at Westminster Abbey in 1997, when Prince Harry was just 12 years old.  Last year Harry admitted in a TV documentary he had only cried twice about his mother\u0027s death in a car crash in Paris, an event which shocked the world. He said: The first time I cried was at the funeral on the island, referring to Diana\u0027s private burial at Althorp. And only since then, maybe once more. There\u0027s a lot of grief that still needs to be... to be let out. By Nicola Small and Victoria Murphy Harry and Meghan made sure Princess Diana was not forgotten on their special day. From the flowers in Meghan’s bouquet to the music and the reading at the service, the couple ensured her presence was felt – 21 years after her crash death. The only reading was about the power of eternal love, with Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes, 61, triggering tears as she said from the Old Testament Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins. Also present was former Prime Minister John Major, who was appointed special  to Princes Harry and William, responsible for legal and administrative matters, when Diana died in the Paris underpass. No British or overseas dignitaries were invited to the wedding, so Mr Major’s presence was a reminder of the pivotal role he played in Harry’s life at a traumatic time. When Meghan arrived at St George’s Chapel, she was carrying a bouquet with Diana’s beloved forget-me-nots. The white petals of Diana’s favourite nestled among blooms picked from Kensington Palace gardens and myrtle sprigs, which are traditional in royal bouquets. Adorning the walls of the 500-year-old chapel were arches of flowers, including white roses, another of Diana’s favourites that were planted in her memory at the palace gardens over the summer. As soon as details of the wedding were announced, Harry said he wanted to “celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day”. Harry was emotional throughout the service and was particularly moved as the congregation sang the final hymn, Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Diana’s 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included it their wedding. Given pride of place in the chapel was Diana’s close friend Julia Samuel, with her husband Michael. Julia is godmother to Prince George and has remained close to William and Harry following Diana’s death, with Meghan previously talking about how much she enjoyed meeting her. There were touching references to Harry\u0027s late mother throughout the ceremony. Meghan carried a bouquet containing forget-me-nots, specifically chosen as they were Diana\u0027s favourite flower.  A spokesperson for Kensington Palace said: The couple specifically chose them to be included in Ms Markle\u0027s bouquet to honour the memory of the late Princess on this special day. Diana\u0027s sister Lady Jane Fellowes gave the only reading of the service, the eighth chapter of the Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins.

The grave remains a focus for pilgrimage and a powerful symbol, known across the world, of the sacrifice, suffering and bravery brought by war.

But while all eyes were on the happy couple, the dress and that kiss, you might have missed what was going on behind them.  There are always subplots to royal weddings - just ask Pippa Middleton , who became an international name on the back of the last one.  So what about this time round?  Let\u0027s take you through them with our sister paper, the Birmingham Mail ...  The British dress stole the show  Meghan looked amazing in a demure gown. And it was designed by acclaimed designer, Clare Waight Keller - who hails from Birmingham. Ms Waight Keller last year became the first female artistic director at the historic French fashion house Givenchy.  The palace said: “Ms Markle expressed the wish of having all 53 countries of the Commonwealth with her on her journey through the ceremony. Ms Waight Keller designed a veil representing the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country united in one spectacular floral composition.” But while the world was watching here\u0027s some things you might have missed in all the excitement. David Beckham laughing - and Victoria not   David couldn\u0027t hold back a smile during the Royal Wedding address by Bishop Michael Curry.  But Victoria looked less than impressed as she failed to raise a smile for the nuptials, the Liverpool Echo reports . The Pageboys carrying the veil  Meghan had ten pageboys and bridesmaids and they did a sterling job during the wedding. Twin boys Master Brian Mulroney and Master John Mulroney both aged seven, did a great job of carrying Meghan\u0027s huge train. Princess Charlotte nailing the Royal Wave  Princess Charlotte is great at wooing the crowds and today was no exception as she carried out her Royal Wave with aplomb. The Princess stole the show when she went to see her newborn baby brother as she waved to photographers and the assembled crowd.  The three-year-old again delighted the crowds with her little wave. Amazing side-eye  The Royal family struggled to keep it together during the Bishop\u0027s unconventional sermon. Zara Phillips reaction was particularly hilarious, with her incredible side-eye.     The Choir singing stand by me The Choir singing Stand By Me was a real highlight of the wedding, with the crowd outside the chapel joining in the singing. The Kingdom Choir led by Karen Gibson performed Stand By Me—the 1961 classic by Ben E. King.   The choir\u0027s rendition caused goosebumps and was a modern addition to the Royal Wedding. Prince Philip looking well  Prince Philip\u0027s attendance at the Royal Wedding was in doubt as he recovers from a hip operation. But the 96-year-old managed to make it to the nuptials and walked down the aisle without a stick or any assistance.

In front of the congregation and the millions of viewers who watched in wonder, Harry could not contain his glee as the Dean of Windsor stood before the couple and spoke about the institution of marriage as “the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured”. Dean David Conner said: “The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. “It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love.” As the word “children” was uttered, Harry, 33, turned to Meghan, 36, and smiled.  A Royal source said: “Harry was bursting with pride the whole ceremony but it was that reaction that caught the eye of those who know him best. It was beautiful and subtle nod to the hope they both have that they will become parents as soon as possible.” Royal biographer Andrew Morton, who researched the new Duchess of Sussex’s life while writing a book about her, also said he expected Harry and Meghan to bring a baby into the world soon. Predicting even more happy news for the couple, he said: “I think that even before Meghan has learned how to spell Leicester and Torquay she’ll be starting a family.  “She’s not really going to be available for working for the Royal Family on a full-time basis until she’s 40, I’m sure.” What\u0027s more, William\u0027s brother and Suits actress Meghan have both indicated they\u0027re very keen to start a family during past interviews. Harry said in 2015: “I’d love to have kids right now.” He added in his engagement interview: “One step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.” Meghan also confided in ex-agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, saying: “I’d absolutely love to have children, and I can’t wait to be a mother.” "},{"url":null,"title":"speculation mounts meghan markles mum","story":"NewsSpeculation mounts Meghan Markle\u0027s mum and \u0027rock\u0027 Doria will move from LA to UK to support daughterMother of the bride may ditch her life as a social worker and yoga teacher to come to Britain after her close bond with Meghan Markle shone through at wedding to Prince Harry\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachael Bletchly23:24, 20 MAY 2018Updated23:27, 20 MAY 2018NewsMeghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria is still a US resident but her experience at the royal wedding may change that (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs they turned on to the Long Walk, where the cheering crowds stood 50-deep, Doria Ragland gazed from the car window and gasped “Wow!” Radiant Meghan, waving at the cheering throng, missed the ripples of emotion that swept over her mother’s face in that moment. Joy, amazement, pride and excitement... but tinged with a hint of fear. Because as Doria, 61, accompanied her daughter on her final journey as a commoner, the \u0026shyenormity of the occasion hit home. She and Meg used to drive around Los Angeles in her car with the number plate Megnme. Now they were in a Rolls-Royce Phantom, heading to Windsor Castle amid all the pomp and ceremony the British monarchy could muster.  Every mother of the bride feels a twinge of sadness at “giving” their girl to their husband. But Doria must have felt a huge sense of loss. She was giving her “Flower” to a Prince, a royal family, a country and an entire Commonwealth. And she had to do so alone, in a foreign country, possibly still jet-lagged and with two billion people around the globe watching on TV. Doria was the only member of the Markle family to attend the wedding. The bride’s half brother and sister were snubbed along with other \u0026shyrelatives after criticising Meghan.  Her dad who’d been due to walk her down the aisle had to pull out for a heart op. Thomas Markle, 73, watched the nuptials on TV as he recovered in Rosarito, Mexico. He later said: “I’ll always regret not being able to be there to hold my daughter’s hand. “My baby girl is a Duchess and I love her so much. Now I pray that Harry and Meghan can go on a nice honeymoon... and all of my \u0026shyrelatives will just shut up.” But Doria conducted herself with such quiet dignity and strength that everyone realised why Meghan calls her: “My rock.” And her unconcealed emotion during the wedding service also won her huge affection.  Sitting opposite the Queen and other reserved royals – still wearing her trademark nose-stud – Doria, wept openly and appeared to live every moment with Meghan as she said her vows. At one point she sighed deeply and shook her head as if she couldn’t quite believe what was happening. And dreadlocked Doria, descended from African slaves who chose the surname “Wisdom”, listened intently as US preacher Michael Curry talked of the civil rights struggle. As he said: “When you’re loved, and know it, it feels right,” she mouthed: “That’s right!” The royal “firm” clearly warmed to Doria, with Prince Charles seeming particularly smitten.  He held her hand during the service as they went to sign the register, supported her as they left the chapel and was seen with his arm around Doria several times at the reception. Now royal watchers are wondering if Doria will give up her life as a yoga teacher and social worker in LA and move to the UK to support Meghan. One royal insider said Meghan has an incredibly close bond with Doria and values her wise counsel. The insider added: “When she and Harry start a family it’ll be incredibly hard if her mum is 5,500 miles away.” Doria’s whirlwind visit will probably seem like a fairy tale when she gets home, believed to be next week. She’ll hang up the elegant pistachio-coloured outfit by Oscar de la Renta and slip into her favourite yoga pants and sweatshirt before walking her dogs.  Then she will be back to work at the mental health services unit where she is a “free-spirited clinical therapist” working with geriatric clients. Doria’s work ethic has always inspired Meghan. After divorcing Thomas in 1987, she became an air stewardess but later returned to university and got a BA in psychology and a masters degree in social work. She also instilled Meghan’s social conscience and interest in charity work – taking her to visit disadvantaged children in Rwanda, see the slums of Jamaica and experience poverty in Mexico when she was 10.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle treated well-wishers to two special kisses on their wedding day, one on the chapel steps and the other in their carriage during their ride around Windsor.  But it was the first one, outside St George\u0027s Chapel, which will become one of the most iconic photographs from the happy day. And the sweet moment is even more special because there\u0027s a touching story behind it.  The tradition of popping out onto the Buckingham Palace balcony to wave to crowds was started by Princess Victoria in 1858. But newly married royal couples didn\u0027t always share a kiss after saying their vows, and they just used to stand awkwardly next to each other and wave. How romantic. It was Prince Harry\u0027s parents Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer who started the sweet tradition after deciding to have a little kiss during their balcony moment after their 1981 wedding.  Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson followed their lead and kissed, and Kate and Wills shared two kisses on the balcony.  Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle, which means they didn\u0027t get their balcony kiss moment. But they recreated it best they could on the church\u0027s steps, with members of the royal family and Meghan\u0027s mum standing behind them. They delighted crowds with a tender kiss, and they couldn\u0027t resist another smooch during their carriage ride.  After the procession the couple went back to the castle for a reception hosted by the Queen. They then changed into their party gear and drove in a Jaguar E-Type sports car to the evening reception, hosted by Prince Charles.

In the first, 15-year-old Meghan sits on black painted railings outside Buckingham Palace. The grainy photograph shows Meghan in slip-on sandals and sunnies, smiling alongside a pal with her whole life ahead of her. In the second, she is a 36-year-old bride - marrying a prince in front of the whole world. Life is full of surprises, one royal fan wrote on Twitter. One day you\u0027re 15 and posing outside Buckingham Palace and 22 years later you\u0027re marrying the prince. What a love story - a true princess in waiting, another said.  Prince Harry and Meghan got married in a dazzling ceremony that blended ancient English ritual with African-American culture yesterday. The celebration, watched up close by royals and celebrities and from afar by a global TV audience of millions, has made history. The two photographs placed side-by-side serve as a reminder of the vast opportunities that stretch out before you age 15. And a love story is made all the better when it has a happy ending. Harry and Meghan were first introduced in London in July 2016 through mutual friends, but they did not start dating straight away. Meghan was still based in her adopted hometown of Toronto, where her US drama Suits is filmed.    They met while Harry was promoting the Invictus Games - an event he helped launch for disabled military personnel - in London, and Meghan shared a picture of herself visiting Buckingham Palace on July 5. She had also been spotted in the royal box at Wimbledon in late June, prompting speculation she was already well acquainted with Harry\u0027s family. Then, in October 2016, the first rumours surrounding their relationship began swirling when the pair were seen at a halloween-party-ideas-budget-2017-9116382\u0026gtHalloween party in Toronto. It was first thought they pair had been dating for around a month, but Meghan later told Vanity Fair they had managed to keep their romance under wraps for an impressive six months.      We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u0027s perception, she said in October 2017. Nothing about me changed. I\u0027m still the same person that I am, and I\u0027ve never defined myself by my relationship. Once the speculation started bubbling, it did not take long before their relationship was blown into the public sphere. Just two weeks after the news broke, Harry took the unprecedented step of blasting the media for prying into Meghan\u0027s private life - and even called out trolls for making racist comments about her. The statement was the first time Harry called Meghan his girlfriend in public as he warned the media to steer clear.    His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment, the statement read. Some of this has been very public - the smear on the front page of a national newspaper the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. It went on: Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his. He has asked for this statement to be issued in the hopes that those in the press who have been driving this story can pause and reflect before any further damage is done. He knows that it is unusual to issue a statement like this, but hopes that fair-minded people will understand why he has felt it necessary to speak publicly.  The pair fell love with Africa separately but it was their first trip together as a couple which sealed their romantic fate. Even before the pair met, they were both involved in various charity projects which saw them visiting the sun-soaked continent. Prince Harry often visited as part of his work for the royal\u0027s charity Sentebale and his role as patron for Rhino Conservation Botswana, while Meghan headed to Rwanda when she was a global ambassador for World Vision. However, it is Botswana that already sits at the forefront of their love story. Prince Harry whisked Meghan away for a luxury safari break just four weeks after their first date. Speaking to the BBC in their engagement interview, Harry said: I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana. We camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.  Meghan did a glossy covershoot and interview with Vanity Fair in October 2017, in which she repeatedly called the royal her boyfriend and gushed about their relationship. We\u0027re a couple. We\u0027re in love, she said. I\u0027m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It\u0027s part of what makes it so special, that it\u0027s just ours. But we\u0027re happy. Personally, I love a great love story. I can tell you that at the end of the day I think it\u0027s really simple. We\u0027re two people who are really happy and in love. Just seven months after they met, Harry reportedly took Meghan to London to meet his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  He is also thought to have introduced his girlfriend to the Queen on Mother\u0027s Day, Sunday March 26 2017. She came with him to Kate\u0027s sister Pippa Middleton\u0027s wedding in May, carefully avoiding the cameras by getting Harry to pick her up after the church ceremony and just in time for the evening reception. The two were seen together at the Invictus Games in Toronto on September 25 2017. Dressed down in skinny ripped jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses, Meghan laughed and smiled as Harry whispered in her ear in full view of spectators. They cosied up together with lots of affectionate touches - and were even spotted kissing inside their private box where Meghan\u0027s mum Doria and her best friends Markus Anderson and Jessica Mulroney were given seats. Kensington Palace announced the couple were engaged on November 27 2017 following weeks of speculation. Later that day, they did an interview with BBC presenter Mishal Husain and revealed extra romantic details about the engagemet.  Meghan admitted it was sweet, natural and very romantic and just a standard typical night in for the pair. The actress admitted she barely let her husband-to-be finish proposing before she said: Can I say yes now? One of their first appearances was at Reprezent 107.3FM in Brixton, south London, in January. The pair later made a trip to Cardiff where Meghan was asked by sisters Anne and Judy Daley - who brought a veil, plastic tiara and bridal sash gift for Meghan - to ask if she would hold her hen party in Cardiff. The beaming actress told them: I bet that would be a lot of fun, before being led away by Prince Harry. In reality the star had a rather quieter hen do in the Cotswolds. Days before the wedding, the pair\u0027s plans were thrown into chaos after Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, pulled out of the ceremony.

The heir to the throne took on the job as Meghan Markle\u0027s own father was unable to attend because of poor health. And what he said to her proves that he was the right man for the job. As she walked into St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle, according to lip readers the prince said: You look lovely, are you OK? MirrorOnline reported yesterday how as Meghan appeared through the doors of the chapel, sunlight streamed in behind her and there were gasps from guests.  She initially walked alone, with one of her page boys caught by TV cameras stifling a yawn. Meghan was then met by Prince Charles at the organ screen, halfway down the chapel - who took her to her bridegroom Prince Harry. The groom told Meghan “you look amazing, I missed you” as he set on eyes on her for the first time on their fairytale wedding day. He was left open-mouthed when she saw his American bride walking down the aisle in her stunning British-designed dress. Harry also told Prince Charles “thank you pa” after he stepped in at the last minute to walk Megan part-way down the aisle.  Meghan and Harry are set to postpone their honeymoon so they can attend a birthday celebration for Charles this week. The newlyweds are expected to return to normal life and bid farewell to the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh after spending the night at Windsor Castle. Meghan has already spoken of her desire to hit the ground running as she becomes a full-time royal. On Tuesday the couple will join Charles and Camilla on the lawns of Buckingham Palace for a Prince of Wales 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration. The outdoor event marks the heir to the throne\u0027s milestone birthday - which falls in November - by recognising Charles\u0027 patronages and military affiliations as well as others involved in charities supported by the royal.  Now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the couple will not immediately leave for their honeymoon but remain in the UK for a period before taking the traditional break. Countries like Botswana - which offer stunning wildlife, breathtaking scenery and, importantly, privacy from prying eyes - could be top of the list.

He initiated my passion for music,\u0026#8221 the 45 from Dundee said.\u0026#8220I started playing at just five years of age or so. My dad once overheard me playing simple tunes on a little toy tune percussion that I was given for my birthday.\u0026#8220My father found the musical talent in me and decided to buy me my own real accordion. My first melodies I learned through my dad were traditional Polish folk tunes.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who was born in eastern Poland and moved to Dundee in 2007, represented Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998 and said his siblings also encouraged his passion as they were very musical themselves.\u0026#8220We would spend countless nights jamming along to music together as a family, and sometimes played a few melodies for guests here and there,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I can recall one night I had to step in for a drummer that did not show up at my dad’s gig, petrified of messing up, though the encouragement from the crowd got me through it.\u0026#8220I was ecstatic at the applause I soon received and the thrill of live music. Still, to this day, I find it hard to believe I was actually able to do it. It was the overwhelming feeling that really appealed me to music.\u0026#8221Music was very connected to his Christian belief, Miroslaw said, and he often played piano or guitar and sung during prayer and worship.\u0026#8220Playing music for me is a very natural way of expressing myself to those around me,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Music connects me with other people in a very unique way.\u0026#8220I met many friends and started relationships through my music.\u0026#8220I even met my wife, Monika, as a young adolescent in a music boarding school back in the 1990s.\u0026#8220Music is a unique, universal language and can be used as a tool to express our feelings or to put a message across that can influence others in various ways.\u0026#8220It definitely can be very therapeutic. I’ve experienced this when working with my young students with special needs or disability. This helped me to understand a different perspective on teaching and helping others.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who is also known as MIREK, is one of 14 tutors at the newly-created Dundee Music Acadamy, which this weekend is offering free lessons in guitar, singing, bass, piano, keyboard, sitar, saxophone, flute, accordion and more.\u0026#8220I always wanted to share my music experiences, tips, knowledge, fancy chords, and how I managed to solve my own musical set backs with others,\u0026#8221 Miroslaw said.\u0026#8220I saw myself becoming a teacher the minute I left the music school, and was surrounded by others alike.\u0026#8220My accordion instructor, Mrs Śliwkiewicz-Cisak, set an example of how much a teacher can help and improve the musical experience for someone else.\u0026#8220It’s a treasure to have this kind of teacher who encourages you to become an independent learner and is able to motivate you to keep going in difficult times. She was the main factor that really pulled me into teaching others.\u0026#8220As a teacher or instructor I not only help students to progress in their musicianship or instrumental skills , but also have a huge impact on their personality and help to shape their character.

Staggies had been keen to poach him from Tannadice as they battle to get back up to the Premiership next term.The Tangerines, however, have persuaded the former Aberdeen, Wigan and Hibs man to stay

they’re set to continue beyond the start of the season in July.So far no clues as to who’s on the wanted list have been forthcoming from Tannadice.But the Tele understands talks with at least two targets are at an advanced stage and deals could be struck over the weekend.Dunfermline pair Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark could be on the verge of joining up.While United have declined to confirm their interest in Clark, the 26-year-old’s proven scoring record at Championship level is something of which they are aware.And despite interest in him from the Premiership – St Mirren have also been linked – a determined effort to get him to Tannadice appears to be ongoing.Ex-Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon is also on their radar and he could be fixed up soon.With other identified targets, the process could take longer.While the departures of 14 players means replacements are needed, and soon, as much time as is needed to ensure the right quality is obtained for next season will be taken.With the season just over, a number of players and agents are on their summer break and that will delay some business. In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing.

campaign group.Organisers of Westfest approached the group about the idea of using the yellow sunglasses emblazed with #SunnyDundee.Campaign manager Jennifer Caswell, from Dundee – One City, Many

there, we would certainly encourage revellers who have a pair to bring them along.“The campaign has been incredible so far.“Dundee has really got on board with it, especially taking pictures and

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed.

It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city. It fits the brief and will add to the city environment and the amenity of the city and the river, so I\u0026rsquom very excited to see it being put forward for the public to see.\"Tilting pier designer Chilean-born architect Karsten Huneck won a contract for a second time after a separate tendering process.An economic assessment carried out for the council had suggested the \"pier\" project would have recouped its cost through additional tourism within two years.Monday 21 May 2018 8:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04099000/04099471.jpg","title":"Lack of cash forces arts group to fold","story":"\u0026nbspAN organisation set up to provide access to arts and cultural activities in a deprived Inverness neighbourhood is to be wound up due to a lack of funding.Since being set up 15 years ago, Arts in Merkinch has been responsible for a broad programme of events and activities including an acclaimed annual arts festival and craft workshops for all ages.
