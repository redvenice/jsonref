This was around 2 or 3am. \u0027They were putting their hands round each other a bit. It certainly seemed more than a bit of interaction with a fan who had come up to him.\u0027She was leaning into him and whispering stuff in his ear and he had his arms around her waist from behind at one point.\u0027They were together for more than an hour and danced a little bit although they didn\u0027t go on to the dance floor.\u0027          Rooney will return to England as player coach at Derby County in January.

Rooney will wear number 32 as part of the deal, which will see him earn £7.8million over 18 months.MPs and the Church of England were among those condemning the link up with the online bookmakers. Rooney himself has admitted gambling away thousands of pounds as a player.A source said of the latest pictures: \u0027This will embarrass Wayne because the Derby manager Phillip Cocu wants him to be a responsible mentor to the players, keeping them out of trouble.\u0027Part of his job will be to encourage them to behave the right way, not stay out late in clubs and bars.\u0027Coleen Rooney ditches wedding ring on shopping trip after husband Wayne is snapped with mystery brunetteFurious Coleen Rooney warns Wayne her brother will babysit him in the US unless he returns to Britain immediately – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Cider festival goers slam money grabbing constantly running cider","story":"Share this article She said each of the bars at the event was \u0027constantly\u0027 running out of cider, according to Gloucestershire Live.

As Fran Lebowitz once said: “If you’re a New Yorker, and you run into another New Yorker in Times Square, it’s like running into someone at a gay bar in the 1970s — you make up excuses about why you’re there.”Now, this tourist-heavy hub in the center of midtown Manhattan is changing — it’s starting to see more art. Spanish artist Domingo Zapata has just finished painting the largest mural New York City has ever seen, hanging 300 feet high on the building at One Times Square. It took him three weeks to paint and will hang here for the next few months.“I thought, ‘Let’s bring something non-commercial to the most commercial part of the world’,” said Zapata. “It’s important for people to take a few minutes and enjoy it. It’s about dreams and how everything is possible. You might see yourself in it and it might make your day more beautiful.”Roughly 340,000 tourists plow through Times Square every day – roughly 50m visit annually – so, this isn’t exactly where one expects to find any artwork (besides the postcard landscapes, maybe, or the naked cowboy).“That’s why we brought it here, it was about time,” said Zapata. “Even advertisements were more artistic before, now everything is data. What happened to the natural attraction to things?”The artwork is essentially about gratitude. “Stop for a second, we’re going too fast with social media. What happened to slowing down and appreciating what’s with you, right now?” he asks. “You might enjoy it.”The mural is covering the LED screens at One Times Square, a 25-story skyscraper owned by Jamestown, which has enormous LED walls handled by the advertising firm, New Tradition. It’s where the New Years’ Eve ball has dropped every year since 1907. This is also where it costs an upward of $1m per year to advertise.Zapata previously did a series of video artworks last year at Times Square, before Jamestown approached him to do a bigger project. “They wanted me to paint a mural where the advertising would be, to do something different,” he said. “They thought I was the artist crazy enough to go up there.”And it did seem a little crazy, considering he had an unexpected hitch. “The first day we got stuck up on the rig for three hours at 200 feet high and lost power, a storm was coming and our power shut down,” said Zapata. “I asked myself, ‘Why am I doing this? What was I thinking?’”Zapata’s towering mural has hints of European modern art. It’s an expressionist romp through familiar symbols (guitars, like the ones Pablo Picasso painted), dapper men in suits (like that of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec) and broad-stroked flowers (like the ones by Henri Matisse).The mural stretches across 15-storys of the building, covering the west, east and south sides of One Times Square. It was created by a team of 25 people, including a handful of painting assistants. It’s not entirely painted however, some of the artwork is printed onto the vinyl.Crank up your neck to read phrases, like “Life is a dream” and “Everybody dies but not everybody lives.”“What I’m trying to say is, here is the most commercial, aggressively financial area in the planet, where people are go, go, go,” said Zapata. “You don’t pay attention to the fact that maybe you don’t need these big, huge dreams, but this combination of the little things and the details. Stop for a second and appreciate what you have. It will give you a big reward.”Before it was created, the largest mural in New York City was a 20,000 square foot painting in the West Village created by Argentinian artist Magda Love alongside local high school students.From a political video art piece by Alfredo Jaar in 1987, to the more recent video art at midnight series, Times Square billboards have seen their fair share of artwork. Recently, Studio 54 co-founder Ian Schrager took over an LED screen wrapped around the corner of 47th Street and Broadway to promote his new hotel with the Sila Sveta design studio to bring back “the sophisticated glitz and high romance” of Times Square in the 1940s.In the months after the artwork is taken down, Zapata’s vinyl mural will be cut into 6x6 foot squares and donated to charities to support art education. Among them, he’ll donate to Pope Francis’ art education foundation, Scholas Occurrentes and Elevate, a New York organization that brings art to inner city schools.“Art is a great therapy to understand you can make your own place in the world, your own magical place,” said Zapata. “I am trying to help others see something positive.”Just as he painted a mural live during the Concert for Peace in Madrid this summer, Zapata is carrying on the same sort of vibe.“I like to send a message of positive energy, no?” says the artist. “I always say, a lot of painters make a statement of what is wrong in the world, I don’t know about politics or how to make the economy better, but I know how to make it more beautiful for people who know how to make it a better place.”“That’s my goal,” he says.“There’s a lot to be worried about we can’t change our world in one day, week or year, but generationally, we can little by little,” said Zapata. “Positive energy is good, but people are used to negativity. In the news, everything is a disaster but not everything is a disaster. There are beautiful things we don’t pay attention to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45f8225532e2d682bf75d297a5be099dfbc2e2d8/0_0_3851_2311/master/3851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ff4a3b935af03b6d5e0791329c70f4d","title":"winners london street photography festival 2019","story":"It is in only its third year, but the LSPF is rapidly establishing itself on the international scene.

I had reckoned without the cricket, but even so, long weekends are, well, pretty long. So did the series deliver on its promise to transport us, like the narrator himself, back to the riverside at Combray and the salons of Paris?One of the central issues that faced dramatist Timberlake Wertenbaker and director and producer Celia de Wolff was how to balance the unparalleled sense of longueur of Proust’s vast roman-fleuve and the recollection of dramatic, frequently fruity incident. It is easier – and perhaps especially so in the grammar of radio – to convey dinner-party repartee than moments of reflection, even when they are performed by the measured, deliberate Derek Jacobi. Thus the ear was drawn more naturally to, for example, Frances Barber’s conspiratorial Madame Verdurin as she gossiped and plotted and decided who was in or out of her social circle.Equally tricky to pull off is the layering of a man in old age summoning up the confusion of the adult behaviour he witnesses in childhood – in our narrator’s case, the social hierarchies embodied by the aristocratic Guermantes family and the unwisely married Swann, which he dimly apprehends but whose import and nuance he naturally misses. “Greedy for happiness,” he muses in later life, of his would-be friendship with the Duchesse de Guermantes (played here by Fenella Woolgar), “I asked nothing more from life in those moments than that it should consist always of a series of happy afternoons”.But life is not always anything, and nor can happy afternoons dispel the other lives that the child experiences, perhaps most notably, and strongly present in this adaptation, the anguish and fear he feels when he is separated from his mother, “his sad evenings and wakeful nights”.Childhood agonies give way to a broader sweep of desires and losses as Combray recedes and the seaside town of Balbec and boulevards of Paris arrive and when the cast of characters enlarges to include the narrator’s love objects, Gilberte (Emma Mackey) and Albertine (Hattie Morahan), Swann himself (Paterson Joseph) and the rakish, libidinous Baron de Charlus, played with gusto by Simon Russell Beale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99634053d252047aa2b74981af2dc0eefe4b3e38/0_117_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58672a80c8a7dc0df22494362bb88b2","title":"reading group which fun book should we read in september","story":"As the world grows more serious, we’re dedicating next month to reading that will entertain and amuse.

I’m not suggesting we hide from reality, but it might be useful to have something to offset the pain for a while. Think of it as a literary restorative.The form that tonic takes is entirely up to you. My first resources when it comes to fun books are always PG Wodehouse and Terry Pratchett and I’d be delighted to read either of them again. But we don’t have to choose something so explicitly humorous. There is plenty to be said for the warm glow that comes from reading a more quietly witty book such as Fup by Jim Dodge. Equally, we could go for something more noisily exuberant, such as Angela Carter’s Nights at the Circus, or something plain and beautiful, such as EL Carr’s A Month in the Country.Or we could lean the other way, into the caustic wit of an Elizabeth Taylor or the ghostly chill of a Shirley Jackson. Maybe your idea of fun is experiencing a gigantic Iain M Banks space opera or immersing yourself in the imagination of Ursula K Le Guin. Maybe it’s getting to the beating heart of a Zadie Smith or Michael Ondaatje novel. Perhaps it’s just the thrill of reading something as linguistically impressive as Virginia Woolf. This could even be an opportunity to revisit Dickens. (There are few greater pleasures in literature than the arrival on the scene of Betsey Trotwood, after all.)Or at least, that’s my opinion. But now it’s up to you. Any book that you regard as fun is fair game and nominating is easy. Just add the title in the comments below – if you can also provide reasons, so much the better.

The cash sum covers the year to 31 May and is £50,000 more than they were paid the previous year. Some of the partners will be paid less than the average, but many will be handed more than £1m. Deloitte has 19,000 staff and 1,070 are partners. However, some 300 of the partners are “salaried” and do not take part in the profit distribution. One in five of the partners are female.Britain’s big accountancy firms have been criticised by politicians and regulators over lax auditing of companies, anticompetitive practices and conflicts of interest. Scrutiny of the firms increased after a string of corporate collapses including Carillion and BHS – companies which had been given a clean bill of health by their auditors.Deloitte and its big rivals PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and EY dominate the market for auditing Britain’s largest companies and have used those relationships to sell more profitable consultancy services.Deloitte last year generated £582m of revenue from audit work, £952m from consulting, and £862m for tax and legal services.In April this year the Competition and Markets Authority stopped short of calling for the big four to be broken up after a review of “serious competition problems”. Its final report called for them to put greater distance between their audit work and more lucrative consultancy operations to prevent conflicts of interest, but also warned the businesses it would look again at forcing them to break apart if the profession did not improve in the next five years.In a withering review of the overall audit market, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) found the quality of Deloitte’s audits declined in 2017-18, although it said the firm had performed better than some others.Stephen Griggs, Deloitte’s managing partner for audit and assurance, said: “We have been consistent in our support for change in the audit market and are positive about many of the proposals that have been put forward.”He added: “However, we do not agree with proposals that would see any form of separation of the audit business from the rest of the firm. Audit quality is considerably enhanced by the investment capacity and access to specialists that being part of a much larger and erse multidisciplinary firm allows.”Deloitte said its distributable profit increase was caused by one-off gains, including the sale of an investment, and currency swings. Without these items, profit would have been unchanged, it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a08ecc41f2e3d224c90beeaaae136df059d4e10f/0_14_4760_2857/master/4760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea83b92a1e34230ecb8811217d92da7","title":"tobacco philip morris altria merger talks","story":"Deal would merge the Marlboro maker with the parent company that sold it off a decade agoTobacco companies Philip Morris and Altria are discussing a merger that would reunite the Marlboro maker with the parent company that sold it off a decade ago.The two companies confirmed on Tuesday that they are discussing an all-stock merger but said there was no guarantee a deal would be reached adding they will “make no further comment regarding the discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so”.Altria spun off Philip Morris International (PMI) in 2008. It sells Marlboro cigarettes in the US and has largely focussed on its domestic market while PMI has focused on selling cigarettes overseas.PMI was valued at $121bn ahead of the news and Altria at $88bn. A possible merger has been predicted by analysts who have speculated the two companies could get back together as they fight falling cigarette sales and the rise of vaping.PMI too has moved to ersify away from cigarettes and has invested heavily in Juul-rival iQOS, a device that heats tobacco rather than burning it. The device is now on sale in 48 markets around the world and will be launched in the US next month after winning approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. PMI said it has about 11 million iQOS users globally.Rival British American Tobacco (BAT) finalized its takeover of Reynolds American Incorporated in 2017, creating the world’s largest tobacco company. That merger too was driven by falling sales and the rise of e-cigarettes and vapes.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) about 1.1 billion people smoked tobacco in 2015.

When we have lacked real journalism, we have seen crimes like mortgage fraud go unnoticed and unpunished, leading to a devastating financial crisis that destroyed millions of Americans’ lives.Real journalism requires significant resources. One reason we do not have enough real journalism in America right now is because many outlets are being gutted by the same forces of greed that are pillaging our economy.For example, two Silicon Valley corporations—Facebook and Google—control 60 percent of the entire digital advertising market. They have used monopolistic control to siphon off advertising revenues from news organizations. A recent study by the News Media Alliance, a trade organization, found that in 2018, as newspaper revenues declined, Google made $4.7 billion off reporting that Google did not pay for.At the same time, corporate conglomerates and hedge fund vultures have bought and consolidated beleaguered local newspapers and slashed their newsrooms—all while giving executives big payouts. Gannett’s proposed merger with Gatehouse Media, for instance, will consolidate hundreds of publications under one mega-corporation’s control and slash $300 million worth of “synergies”—which is often corporate-speak for layoffs. Matt Pearce, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, notes that “the new GannettGatehouse CEO is getting $4.5m in bonuses and stock just for walking in the door.”The result of these trends has been the decimation of journalism. Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 communities across the country have lost newspapers, which are the outlets local television, radio, and digital news sites rely on for reporting. Since 2008, we have seennewsrooms lose 28,000 employees—and in the past year alone, 3,200 people in the media industry have been laid off. Today, for every working journalist, there are six people now working in public relations, often pushing a corporate line.At precisely the moment when we need more reporters covering the healthcare crisis, the climate emergency, and economic inequality, we have television pundits paid tens of millions of dollars to pontificate about frivolous political gossip, as local news outlets are eviscerated.The negative effects are predictable: according to a working paper by researchers at Notre Dame and the University of Illinois, when newsrooms are hollowed out, overall costs to taxpayers rise, because there are fewer reporters scrutinizing government transactions. A study published by Spotlight on Poverty and Opportunity, a non-partisan forum, found that, despite millions of Americans struggling to survive, budget-strapped “newsrooms have not turned their attention to poverty.”To be sure, when we see the Miami Herald exposé on Jeffrey Epstein or the Charleston Gazette-Mail’s courageous reporting on the opioid crisis, we know that good reporters are still overcoming the odds and managing to produce essential journalism that scrutinizes power, exposes wrongdoing, and challenges the status quo. But we know that those success stories are too often the exception and not the norm.We also know that Donald Trump is making things far worse. He is a pathological liar who has spent his presidency trying to demonize journalists when they dare to debunk his lies. Worse, he has called the media the “enemy of the people” in a deliberate attempt to destroy the very idea of a free press.Trump’s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected. But let us be clear: that alone will not solve the journalism crisis. Moreover, a further expansion of oligarchic business models in the media industry could make matters worse.Today, after decades of consolidation and deregulation, just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch, read, and download. Given that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and “benevolent” billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny.After all, TV networks that rely on $4.5 billion a year of pharmaceutical ads may be thrilled to sugarcoat our current dysfunctional health care system—but they will never provide a consistently fair hearing for something like Medicare for All, even though polls show that a majority of Americans support such a proposal.Corporate media organizations sponsored by fossil fuel industry ads may gladly provide a platform for guests who insist that our current oligarchic economy is just great, but as studies show, the same outlets often downplay or omit coverage of the climate crisis that those advertisers are helping create.And news outlets owned by Disney and Jeff Bezos may happily tout Disney films and Bezos’s plans for space exploration, but we cannot count on them to consistently and aggressively cover workers’ fight for better wages at Disney- or Bezos-controlled companies. In fact, in one instance, we saw that The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, tried to punish a reporter because he spoke out for better wages at the newspaper.We need to rebuild and protect a erse and truly independent press so that real journalists can do the critical jobs that they love, and that a functioning democracy requires.When I am president, my administration will put in place policies that will reform the media industry and better protect independent journalism at both the local and national levels.For example, we will reverse the Trump administration’sattempts to make corporate media mergers even more likely in the future. We are not going to rubber stamp proposals like the new plan to merge CBS and Viacom into a $30b colossus.I have long opposed media consolidation, and was one of only 16 members of the US House to oppose the disastrous 1996 Telecommunications Act, which accelerated consolidation. In my administration, we are going to institute an immediate moratorium on approving mergers of major media corporations until we can better understand the true effect these transactions have on our democracy.In the spirit of existing federal laws, we will start requiring major media corporations to disclose whether or not their corporate transactions and merger proposals will involve significant journalism layoffs.We will also require that, before any future mergers can take place, employees must be given the opportunity to purchase media outlets through employee stock-ownership plans—an innovative business model that was firstpioneered in the newspaper industry.And we will prevent media-related merger and deregulation decisions at federal agencies that adversely affect people of color and women. As the non-profit watchdog group Free Press has noted, “Women and people of color are woefully underrepresented among broadcast-license holders.” The group points out that this is because when the Federal Communications Commission has approved mergers it has failed “to consider how such concentration affects ownership opportunities for women and people of color.”When our administration appoints new, progressive leadership at the FCC, we will reverse the Trump administration’s moves, which have gutted longstanding media ownership rules. What Trump has done allows cross-ownership of newspapers and television or radio stations he has also given the green light to owning multiple stations in the same market. The harm may be great: “In theory,” says Free Press, “these changes would allow a single broadcaster to own both your local newspaper and your top-two local broadcast stations, plus operate a handful of other stations through sharing agreements—turning your community into a one-newsroom town.”In a Bernie Sanders administration, we will do the opposite: we will reinstate and strengthen media ownership rules, and we will limit the number of stations that large broadcasting corporations can own in each market and nationwide. We will also direct federal agencies to study the impact of consolidation in print, television, and digital media to determine whether further antitrust action is necessary.Additionally, we will pass my Workplace Democracy Plan, which will boost media workers’ laudable efforts to form unions and collectively bargain with their employers. I have publicly supported journalists’ efforts to unionize. Unions not only fight for media workers’ wages and benefits, they can also better protect reporters from corporate policies that aim to prevent journalists from scrutinizing media owners and their advertisers.Finally, when it comes to Silicon Valley, I will appoint an Attorney General as well as Federal Trade Commission officials who more stringently enforce antitrust laws against tech giants like Facebook and Google, to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk, and defund news organizations. Their monopoly power has particularly harmed small, independent news outlets that do not have the corporate infrastructure to fight back.We must also explore new ways to empower media organizations to collectively bargain with these tech monopolies, and we should consider taxing targeted adsand using the revenue to fund nonprofit civic-minded media. That will be part of an overall effort to substantially increase funding for programs that support public media’s news-gathering operations at the local level—in much the same way many other countries already fund independent public media.Our constitution’s First Amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy. More than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda.We must take action –\u0026nbspand if we do, I know we can be successful. We can and will restore the media that Joseph Pulitzer and Walter Cronkite envisioned, and that America so desperately needs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a199047f014ee2ac6fbbfc5af45fb3ffa45ca56c/42_0_5152_3092/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fdcb23d3321f4a4a145fa5d65f3f9a9","title":"corbyn summit no deal brexit avoidable","story":"Good news from the bubble of party politics: Britain’s opposition leaders have today decided to engage and cooperate rather than facilitate national food and medicine shortages in nine weeks’ time.Many commentators suggested that Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Change UK and Greens would yield little but grandstanding and bad temper. On the contrary, participants have described a positive and constructive session, with further summits planned. Their joint statement stresses the “urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence”.The statement represents a long-overdue acknowledgment that an unprecedented crisis must be met with an unprecedented response. Labour is correct that Boris Johnson threatens an abuse of power unparalleled by any British prime minister in modern times. If he is prepared to shred convention, so must his opponents.Today’s meeting is highly significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that, when push comes to shove, politicians who may personally dislike or distrust each other can sit around a table and work seriously, cordially and productively. Second, and more importantly, it highlights that MPs have the means at their disposal to stop no deal. They already had the numbers. Now they are showing the willing.A no-deal Brexit has always been avoidable if MPs wanted to avoid it. That is because we live in a parliamentary democracy and not Johnson’s personal fiefdom. A legislative approach was always going to be less contentious than a vote of no confidence, because it does not require Tories to vote their own government out of office. With a new law, MPs can force the prime minister to request a new extension. They can demand that he accepts it. They can – and should – legislate for a revocation of article 50 if he fails to accept it or if the EU fails to grant it. Two-thirds of the Commons – like the public they represent – oppose no deal. They will also want to avoid being blamed for no deal. If they unite to stop it, they can – and there is now every reason to believe they will.Corbyn deserves credit here. He is not a politician famed for cross-party cooperation, but has acknowledged that his proposal to lead a caretaker government will probably fail, and has now invited 116 Tory opponents of no deal to join the dialogue. Perhaps our politicians really have grasped the truth of the moment: Johnson has left no more space for anyone else’s ego. Now is the time for flexibility and collegiality.Today has also taught us an important lesson about our political system. For the past fortnight, the opposition parties resorted to the zone of greatest comfort: partisan attacks. Labour and the Lib Dems were angrily denouncing each other. Corbyn was refusing to signal any openness to an alternative caretaker prime minister. Other parties were either demanding categorical assurances that Labour would now support remain in all circumstances, or else insisting they could not support Corbyn in any. This was tribalism at its most short-sighted and self-defeating. The only beneficiary was the government.No deal would be a calamity for our economy, society and democracy. Stopping it must be our absolute priority. But we can go further. Today must mark a comprehensive watershed in how our political parties interact in the national interest. It is possible to maintain a distinctive party identity while recognising, and even celebrating, common ground with others. On the continent this kind of cross-party cooperation is seen as normal and essential. It should not be considered revelatory here. In the end, perhaps Brexit will make us fully European after all.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f54347889ce8766a1f7b15b91a24717f682529/891_97_3069_1842/master/3069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a71402d7f1b18c27ad59170c88e4910d","title":"second referendum labour no deal revoking article 50","story":"The anti-no-deal politicians meeting today need to find a way to work together – and Labour will have to compromiseYou can tell there’s a general election coming, because that’s the subtext to everything else that happens. Boris Johnson uses the G7 summit to grandstand to the domestic tabloids. Meanwhile the fractious coalition of anti-no-deal forces meets today to try and form a coherent plan to stop Britain crashing out of the EU – and to force an election.If the object was to fight no deal through parliamentary process, the only people you would need in the room would be Dominic Grieve and Keir Starmer, with maybe somebody taking notes for John Bercow. But today’s get-together, convened last week by Jeremy Corbyn, is as much about a general election, which few people now doubt will happen sooner rather than later. Given that, it would have been better to enter the room in the spirit of anticipated unity, rather than publicly set out your red lines beforehand, as Jo Swinson has done. She reportedly wrote a letter to Corbyn yesterday, arguing that his insistence on leading a temporary government of national unity would be likely to scupper a vote of no confidence in the government.One of the many things I look forward to, at the end of this whole ignominious business, is the prospect of politicians finally ceasing to flaunt their inflexibility as if it were a virtue. Because it isn’t.Yet if Corbyn, Swinson and co can recognise a few elemental truths about their predicament, the meeting today could yet deliver something invaluable to those of us outside it: hope.All remain parties and actors need to stop performing their oppositional moves and accept as an inevitability that they have to work together. Labour historically, and Jeremy Corbyn personally, have shown no aptitude or enthusiasm for progressive alliances, but the leader of the opposition must recognise that activists and members are going to work together regardless, as they did in 2017 (and as they did in 1997). There is a very plain advantage to be had for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats from reaching an understanding (the Greens stand to gain the least, I would guess Caroline Lucas, fortunately, doesn’t fight for her own or her party’s collective ego).According to yet-to-be-published projections made by Best for Britain, of the 150 marginals across England and Wales where a remain alliance could make the difference, in 111 the numbers dictate that the Lib Dems swing behind Labour. The benefit to Labour is obvious. For Swinson, 40-odd seats would still represent a massive uptick in her party’s fortunes.Remainers on the centre-right, who are currently cleaving to what’s been called the Meatloaf stance (“I’d do anything for Europe, but I won’t make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister”) have to think more deeply about their objections. Whatever threat Corbyn may pose to capitalism, it is as nothing compared to the threat from vulture capitalists and high priests of disruption and chaos emptying their pots of cash into Dominic Cummings’ cauldron.If the danger represented by this government bore any relation to its competence, we’d have nothing to worry about. But the disunity of the forces opposing it is giving it a potency it does not deserve. We will only haul ourselves out of this nightmare period when the politics of solidarity and co-operation wrests the controls from the politics of delinquency and destruction. That has to start in this meeting. There’s a good argument for them all to smoke a joint before they go in.It is also increasingly clear that Labour has an additional challenge of its own: the party needs to pivot to “revoke”. Not as a peace offering to the other parties, but because it’s the only position that now makes sense. The idea of a Labour-negotiated deal, which protects workers’ rights, drives forward international cooperation on the environment, and maintains the EU as our major trading bloc, while differing meaningfully from membership of the EU, is fanciful. A second referendum, meanwhile, is pointless given that any general election will, itself, function as one: the Brexit parties are there for Brexiteers to vote for. Of course, if a government of national unity itself chose to revoke article 50, then arguably that would create a democratic deficit. But if, in the context of an election, the country is asked point blank whether it wants to leave or revoke, no such crime against the will of the people has been perpetrated.The Conservatives and the Brexit party are making the vast unsubstantiated promise that a combination of grit, optimism and tech will solve every problem associated with Brexit. Some of us spend our time wondering why these arguments hold fast against any evidence to their contrary why they’re so immune to reality and reason. But Labour now needs to make a vast promise of its own: revoke. In that moment, Brexit will be revealed for what it is – a civil war embroiling all of us that should have stayed within the confines of the Conservative party, where it belonged.Boris Johnson and Cummings will not be waiting with bated breath to see if a vote of no confidence prevails. They will have their decision tree, with a general election on one branch, a no-deal Brexit on the other it all leads ultimately to the polling booth, and all who oppose them should be ready for an election on the first possible date: 17 October, six weeks after parliament reassembles. And readiness is not a reheating of Facebook ads and leaflets with slightly-too-complicated promises it is a united promise to revoke, from allies who put their nation ahead of their tired hostilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfcca9d879b974c4c42738f490bd5c247014c03/0_236_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17caa3bd9c69114ed8f0e60998f5cc92","title":"leaked documents reveal tories dramatic plans for schools","story":"Exclusive: crackdown on behaviour coupled with more money for schools and teachersA raft of dramatic and controversial education measures including billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools are to be announced by the government within days, according to a confidential briefing paper seen by the .The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked “Official-Sensitive”, details a blizzard of policy proposals designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in a bid to seize the initiative on education ahead of a possible autumn election.While proposals including a £3.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers’ basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use “reasonable force” to improve behaviour.The paper, which is under discussion between Gavin Williamson’s Department for Education (DfE) and No 10, is understood to have been inserted into the government “grid” of announcements, as families prepare for the new school year in England.The headline figures include £2.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including £800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The details for an extra £800m for sixth form and further education colleges are still under discussion with the Treasury.The main proposals in the package include:Any additional funding is likely to be welcomed by school leaders, although many will want to wait until they see how much of the headline figure has been “reprioritised” from the DfE’s previous spending commitments.Aside from funding, the DfE paper includes a major focus on poor behaviour in schools, said to be driven by No 10’s view that recent polling has shown strong public support for policies taking a tougher line.The announcements will include explicit support for headteachers who use “reasonable force” in their efforts to improve discipline.“This government backs headteachers to improve behaviour and will support them to create safe and disciplined school environments,” the document states.“We will back heads to use powers to promote good behaviour including sanctions and rewards using reasonable force to search and confiscate items from pupils (including mobile phones) impose same-day detentions suspend and expel pupils ban mobiles phones.”While the DfE expects that members of the public will welcome “a harder narrative on discipline”, the document warns that key stakeholders will be worried the policy will result increased rates of permanent exclusion, which have in any case been climbing since 2012.The document notes that police and crime commissioners “worry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime” and acknowledges concerns that it will impact disproportionately on children from some ethnic minority backgrounds, in particular black Caribbean boys, and those with special educational needs (SEN).The success of the Michaela free school in last week’s GCSE results is likely to be used by ministers to promote its behaviour policies, while four “behaviour tsars” are to be named, including Charlie Taylor, the former head of a school for children with SEN and the current chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales.While recent coverage of school funding cuts has included widespread reporting about teaching assistants (TAs) being axed and headteachers’ concerns about the detrimental impact on classrooms, the briefing paper reveals – on the contrary – that Downing Street and the Treasury are more concerned that there may be too many TAs rather than too few.“No 10 and HMT have been keen to publicly express concerns about the rising number of TAs and set out government’s commitment to more effective deployment of TAs being integral to more efficient use of school spend,” it states.The document advises against going public with this line, warning “it would undermine the ‘hearts and minds’ aspect of the announcement with the numerous audiences we know value TAs – parents, teachers, heads and SEND lobby. This needs to be handled very sensitively if we are to protect the positivity of the announcement.”The Treasury “firmly” rejected a radical attempt to improve recruitment by making teacher training courses free for students. But it appears more enthusiastic about a scheme to reimburse trainee teachers for their student loans.The DfE has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3074001a2202f86247ac51034088c4b6b8e0d8/0_239_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac72b4483571f2d791fd3ec447e4e01","title":"extreme makeup girls boys generation z new subculture","story":"Many young people now spend hours in their bedrooms, perfecting extraordinarily intricate looks to put up online ‘It’s literally art!” exclaims 16-year-old Milly Provenzano, sitting cross-legged on her single bed. Her eyeshadow is like the plumage of a tropical bird: blue, pink and yellow, to match the rainbow lettering on her Pride T-shirt. On the wall above her, Provenzano has taped up photographs of her favourite Instagram makeup stars: drag artist Hungry, famed for transforming Björk into a vagina-flower hybrid for the cover of her Utopia album, and Antoinette Mahr, whose trademark multicoloured style was clearly the inspiration for Provenzano’s look today. I have asked the teenager from Kettering, Northamptonshire, to justify the many hours she spends alone in her room, perfecting fabulously complicated makeup looks. “That’s like saying to someone who does A-level art and is painting all the time, ‘Oh you shouldn’t be doing that, you should be doing something more academic.’ It’s just art, but it’s on your face.”Pulling out her phone, Provenzano shows me a list of makeup looks she would like to master. Her inspirations are erse and obscure. “I’d really like to do an Error 404-inspired look,” she muses. “You know when something glitches online? It’s mainly black and white, but also green and red.” I browse the list – what does the “eyebrow slits … but everywhere” entry mean? “I’ve already done that one!” she says. “I’d just given myself an eyebrow slit, and I woke up in the middle of the night and thought, why not do it everywhere on my face? So I got a tiny brush and concealer, and drew lines through my makeup.”Provenzano shows me a photo. Her eyes are orange. Her cheeks are a garish pink. There are thin lines down her face, as if her makeup has been stencilled around them. It is enormously impressive. After she finished the look, Provenzano uploaded a picture to Instagram, then washed the makeup off. “Sometimes I keep it on if I really like it,” she shrugs. “Then a few hours later, I’ll take it off.”Once, young people used makeup as visual code to gain admittance into different subcultures: black lipstick for goths, winged eyeliner for punks. Now, makeup is a subculture all of its own. In communities centred around Instagram and YouTube, young people gather virtually to look for inspiration, swap product tips and master tricky techniques. They often come to makeup through superstar vloggers such as NikkieTutorials (12.2m subscribers), Jeffree Star (15.6m subscribers) and James Charles, who boasts 15.9m subscribers, despite a series of scandals, one of which involved his former mentor releasing a 45-minute video claiming he had pressured heterosexual men to go out with him (claims he denied in another video), temporarily losing him millions of followers.In this community, your face is a canvas for incongruous, dreamlike, wearable art. All you need is some pocket money and a smartphone. But what is fascinating about this new subculture is that it is not taking place in crowded moshpits or twilit parks, but quietly in bedrooms. “I don’t go out much,” says Provenzano. “My friends come here or we go to their houses … but we don’t really go places.”Aiman Sheeraz, a 17-year-old from Manchester, says: “My favourite skill is blending. This is what YouTube has taught me – to blend my life away.” Sheeraz got into beauty because of her mum, who loved makeup. “We’d watch Asian bridal makeup tutorials and try to recreate them together. Looking back at the pictures, they were so horrific!”After her mum died two and a half years ago, Sheeraz started doing makeovers on her family and friends, posting the results online. “I thought, why not get my talent out there?” At first, Sheeraz did the makeup thing to honour her mum. But soon it took on a life of its own. “It was never what I wanted to do full-time,” says Sheeraz, who is studying for an apprenticeship in accountancy. “It’s more something to do on her behalf and make her happy. But now I really enjoy it myself. I guess I’m doing it for her in a way.”As with any subculture, there are different tribes. Fans tend to ide into two camps: the first are lovers of the haute-glam look popularised by the Kardashian-Jenners and makeup artists such as Mario Deanovic and Kevyn Aucoin. Sheeraz falls into this category, describing her style as “Asian glam”: “a very glowy base, full coverage, bright lips and eyes, but also something that you can wear to weddings and events – it won’t just look nice in pictures.” Meanwhile, creative makeup fans prefer art-driven, colourful looks. “With creative makeup there aren’t many rules, you can do what you want,” says Niamh Dunne, a 19-year-old supermarket worker from Corby, Northamptonshire. Dunne takes inspiration from films or TV shows such as Stranger Things. After the Lion King reboot came out, she freehand-painted the amber and ochre colours of an African sunset on her chest. It took three hours.Critics may say that young people shouldn’t be messing around with blusher – they should be focusing on their careers. But this is wildly missing the mark: beauty is a very lucrative career choice. Just ask Kylie Jenner, who built a billion-dollar fortune off the back of her cosmetics company (although sales are rumoured to be down). Of the 80 women on Forbes’s so-called “self-made women” rich list this year, 10 are from the makeup and skincare industries.Sheeraz wants to become like her idol, the beauty mogul Huda Kattan. “Being a woman of colour and getting to where she is from being an average person is really inspirational to me.”I wonder if any of the teens think it may be damaging to be so focused on their appearance. They all bat those concerns away. “Most of the time I’m actually barefaced,” Sheeraz says. “When I go to work, I don’t wear it, because I’d rather spend the time sleeping.” Dunne agrees: “With teenage girls, there is so much pressure on the way you look – getting surgery and lip fillers and all of that stuff,” she says. “I don’t think it should be like that. I don’t wear it because I think I need it. I wear it because I enjoy doing it.”It is not just girls who are perfecting makeup techniques you’ve never heard of, such as halo brows or lollipop lips. Brands such as Milk Makeup and Fluide have created genderless cosmetics ranges, while legacy players including Chanel and Givenchy have launched male lines. They are targeting consumers like 17-year-old Matt Tierney. “I remember sneakily telling my mum I had a Halloween party to go to when I was 14, so we could go to Superdrug and buy some makeup. She asked, ‘Are you sure this is for Halloween?’” He laughs. Through YouTube, Tierney built up the confidence to experiment with makeup. “If I didn’t see people doing it online, I’d never have gotten into it. I live in a little village in Northamptonshire. I’ve never seen anyone walking around with a rainbow eye or in drag. You don’t see that here.”Of course, marketing makeup to men doubles the amount of product brands can sell. And there is no doubt that consumerism is at the heart of this subculture – to an alarming extent. Provenzano takes me to her local Superdrug. “If I’m in town, I’ll come in to have a look,” she says, fingering a yellow Revolution eyeshadow lovingly. (Provenzano favours affordable brands – although she has a few high-end eyeshadow palettes by the US brand Lime Crime – that aren’t tested on animals.) Makeup influencers such as Jaclyn Hill have landed themselves in trouble with their young fanbases over the quality of their products – in one case, her lipstick was said to contain metal shards. Tierney bought the James Charles x Morphe palette after seeing it hyped online. “I didn’t think it was that great, to be honest. Maybe everyone saying it was amazing was on his payroll.”Regulators have started to step in. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission wrote to high-profile influencers to warn them against “stealth shilling”, where they fail to disclose they are being paid by brands. Earlier this year, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority secured formal commitments from celebrities to be more transparent about paid-for endorsements.Even then, young people may not be able to recognise when their favourite online makeup artists are pushing products because they are paid to advertise them. “What we see in the research is that they don’t really recognise the advertising in vlogs or on Instagram as advertising, as much as they do on TV,” warns Steffi de Jans of Ghent University. She characterises most beauty vlogs as effectively advertising: the vloggers are either being paid by the brand directly, or receiving free products. And this isn’t just a 30-second cereal advert in a commercial break. “It’s hours and hours in a row of advertising messages, and they’re really engaging with it.”Subcultures have always been consumer-adjacent: you buy records, safety pins, miniskirts. But the act of consumerism isn’t peripheral to this emerging beauty subculture – it’s integral to it. This is consumerism as subculture. Sheeraz estimates she has spent about £1,000 on products from brands including Anastasia Beverly Hills and Huda Beauty, whose palettes retail for £40 to £60. Can a community that is so predicated on consumer consumption truly be considered a subculture?Probably not, says Dr Rehan Hyder of the University of the West of England, explaining that it is better to think of these teenagers according to the concept of creative fandom, as coined by academic Henry Jenkins. “Fans aren’t just consumers, but producers. They’re not participating passively, but creating a community in which you share expertise, skills and collective intelligence.” In the beauty world, they use makeup to establish themselves as persons of influence and skill – like Tierney, who aims to achieve 100k followers. “That would be a massive milestone,” he says.As teenage pursuits go, however, it is hard to think of a more clean-living way for young people to be spending their time – a bottle of shoplifted vodka being passed around a park this is not. “I’m not really a going-out person,” says Dunne. “You just get hungover and can’t be productive the next day.” Tierney thinks that makeup gives young people something to do. “It’s quite wholesome,” he laughs. “People who have no lives, sitting in their room with a ring light on, blending makeup on their eyes!” (He recently got one of these lights himself.)Ring lights, contour kits, an arsenal of brushes to make Picasso blush: for teenagers today, makeup isn’t a superficial hobby, but a way of expressing their creativity, hopes and dreams. Back in her bedroom, Provenzano does my makeup while telling me about her ambitions for the future – she aspires to be a makeup artist for fashion shows. “Going to London,” she says dreamily, eyeshadow brush in hand. “The fashion weeks – Milan, London, Paris. Obviously I can’t stay in Kettering and do runways, because it’s so small.” And as she applies my eyeshadow with precision of a surgeon performing keyhole surgery, I close my eyes and think: “You’ll get there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9ebf542cd05a03e9f435b656c1b479eb8181d0d/0_1072_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea5f555c04a31d36d389f03c8f030956","title":"russell tovey pink is the opposite of emasculating not shy about wearing","story":"The actor on his favourite Paul Smith outfit, and how he loves the effortless style of Steve McQueen and Jean-Michel BasquiatThis outfit is all Paul Smith.

I also like Jean-Michel Basquiat’s look – the cardigans the loose-fitting, bohemian clothes. I’m very envious of people who can look effortlessly stylish – it’s what I aspire to.

Fans hope that an 11th-hour deal – which first emerged two hours before the deadline on Friday night – crosses the line by 5pm.The local MP, Ivan Lewis, was among scores of people helping to clean the stadium’s famous blue and white seats on Tuesday morning, many having travelled for miles to help out.“It’s very, very moving in many ways,” he said. “To see this reaction from Bury supporters, from people who live in the town who maybe aren’t football fans – we’ve got people here from Blackpool. This is a tremendous outpouring of community spirit. I’ll be honest, out of adversity over the last few weeks and months this town has really shown its strength.”Lewis, the independent MP for Bury South, said both Bury and Bolton were in “the last-chance saloon” and that the crisis raised serious questions about the governance of English football.He added: “People are absolutely tenacious, passionate, determined to keep this club going, both for what it represents in terms of traditions of the town, but also it means so much to two, three, four generations in some families for whom this club has been everything.“You can see a reaction today like you wouldn’t see in many other communities or clubs. People scrubbing the seats, getting the stadium ready, and optimistic and hopeful that the first game of the season will be on Saturday. It’s very, very powerful.”“We’ve cleaned every seat, so we want to see someone sat in every seat on Saturday,” Gifford said, adding that the atmosphere inside the 11,840-capacity stadium would be “absolutely phenomenal” if the club survives.“It’s been the most difficult four months for us as fans. It’s been the most difficult six years for us,” he said. “We just want to have a total rethink about how this club operates and be involved with the new owners. Hopefully they’ve got a clean slate to start the club with and we’ll look forward to helping them let it grow.”The two-time FA Cup winners have faced a tumultuous 20 years off the pitch, having narrowly avoided going bust in both 2002 and 2012. Last season’s ownership drama formed the backdrop to a successful period on the pitch, with the club winning promotion to League One, the third tier of English football.Carrying her gloves, bucket and sponge, 72-year-old Joan Lingard was cleaning the stadium’s seats by 9am on Tuesday. It would be “absolutely awful” for Bury if its club disappeared, she said.“Everybody’s come down, whether they come to the matches or not. I’d hate to see it go. Next to Bury black puddings, this is the next thing, Gigg Lane. The two are synonymous,” she said.Ian Frazer, 48, a Leeds fan, set off at 8am to make the 41-mile trip to Gigg Lane to take part in the cleanup, motivated by the financial crisis experienced by his own club 12 years ago. Wearing a Leeds shirt while scrubbing pigeon droppings off Bury’s Manchester Road stand, Frazer said: “It’s simple stuff like this that’s fantastic to see – all the kids here. I kind of welled up when I got here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c52d8ef367e5311b22157a9f994dadc25065396/4_43_5141_3085/master/5141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=988c38d1ac62f85a8546beeac0e693ab","title":"jordi cruyff johan barcelona spiritual father statue","story":"Before the unveiling of a statue outside Camp Nou, Jordi Cruyff talks of how his famous father shaped his life and why it did not work out at Manchester UnitedThe way Jordi Cruyff tells the story, the way his mum and dad always told it, one day Johan Cruyff turned to the family, and said: “Listen, I have to put my boots back on: we’re going to the US.” There is a pause, a smile, and Jordi adds: “‘We fly in five hours.’”He was only four but he has heard it often and, like everything else, it was a lesson. Listening to him on the morning Barcelona unveil a statue of their spiritual father, his actual father, there are many of them: moments that helped shape him, that shaped them all. “He reached so many people, touched them,” Jordi says. There may be no one who influenced football like he did.Jordi has not prepared a speech. He has only just found out it’s today he has to talk, not the following evening when the Johan Cruyff stadium is inaugurated at Barça’s Sant Joan Despí training ground. Named for a man who believed in development, forming an identity, it is appropriate it will be used by youth teams. The speech will be short, Jordi says and, anyway, he prefers to improvise. “This is my dad, not me,” he says. “The person who had to speak isn’t here.”Cruyff died in March 2016 but he is always there. On the mantelpiece, there are three Ballons d’Or. The key to the city of Barcelona is on a shelf, Netherlands, Barcelona and Ajax shirts hang, and a picture of his most iconic Barcelona goal covers the wall. While there is something important in that line – “this is my dad, not me” – he is there in Jordi, whose father gave him everything, including that surname and that first name, the same as Catalonia’s patron saint – a story Johan told with a mischievous grin. And now he is there in bronze by the Camp Nou.“My father would say: ‘Here I am,’” Jordi will say later.Beneath the statue is perhaps Cruyff’s most famous line from just before the 1992 European Cup final: “Go out there an enjoy it.” The statue expresses his legacy, ideas, teachings. “It’s harder than you imagine to get a statue right,” Jordi notes. “I have a vision of him, other people have a different one.” There are different teachings, which is where the day Cruyff came out of retirement comes up, helping explain why Jordi embarked on his own fascinating journey.Cruyff had invested in a failed pig farm. He had no choice but to play again. When he did, heading to the NASL, it took him 125 seconds to score on his debut. He played for a further six years, later saying it had been a mistake to give up so early.“I leant from my dad, the way he talked about his mistakes. He lost everything, everything,” Jordi says. “And when you trip up you don’t do it again. You try to ensure others don’t either. He always talked about a plan B. He hadn’t finished school and insisted we did. He looked at life experiences, saw what he didn’t have, took lessons and gave us them.“If you ever asked him for money, for example, you had to earn it. If I got bad grades, he stopped me playing football. He was affectionate with us, but strict, demanding.”Jordi studied business while at Barcelona at Manchester United, he did a postgraduate degree in marketing with Roberto Martínez. A curiosity, chance too, took him from there to Malta, Cyprus, Israel, Ukraine and China. “I like strange challenges,” he says.Jordi was mature enough to not waste it he invested in a small flat he still has. He was not though mature enough to succeed and constant injuries ruined things. “It was hard for me and it’s my fault,” he says. “I’ve always liked city life, being within walking distance of everything but everyone lived to the south. It lacked something for me. It was hard to adapt: the food, the hours, the lack of sun – that light gives energy. Daft things. If I’d gone a year later, maybe, but I was only 21. I also struggled to fully grasp the enormity of the club.”But you had come from Barcelona. “Yes, but it was more. You’d go to China, Hong Kong, and there were thousands and thousands and thousands of people. It’s changed but they were a long way ahead on a lot of things then – maybe they still are on some. The football was totally different too. People in Spain got up from their seat for a good dribble. In England, people got up for a flying tackle.From United, Jordi went to Alavés, scoring in the 2001 Uefa Cup final against Liverpool, then Eyol. Ukraine and Malta followed and he is on his seventh country now, China. He has been player, coach, sporting director. He changed Maccabi Tel Aviv, coming to dominate Israeli football and propelling the careers of managers including Oscar García, Slavisa Jokanovic, Pako Ayesterán and Paulo Sousa. He employed himself as coach – sacked himself too. Asked how you convince a player to join you in the places he has worked, he thinks about his current job coaching Chongqing Dangdai Lifan and laughs. “Well, in China it’s easy.”Little else is. He discusses how his father’s principles – possession, dominating – evolve and have to be tailored to players. He talks about language, character, lifestyles returns home to talk about the work done at the Cruyff Foundation, and the youth system down the hill at Barça how their best players are stolen by English and German teams at 15, 16. He talks about the social ide there. Cruyff’s statue may help to unite a club where there have been cleavages: the symbolism is important and reconciliation, unity, was one of his dad’s final wishes. Jordi talks too of his own future – there or elsewhere, he does not know. About all the lessons learned, from his father and his own journey, what it all means.At Maccabi, his team were forced to play home games away. “We had Muslim and Jewish players and I was watching, interested. ‘Will they argue?’” he says. “But sport has a power politics never manages, a capacity to unite people that nothing else has. When the game came the ball brought them together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ff20b388fcbcfa9372ba725aeedfbd8f63fb96/0_122_3825_2295/master/3825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e73426ac0f6468bfb11a3cb48d5120a4","title":"steve bruce newcastle carabao cup","story":"• Injuries limit attacking options against Leicester on Wednesday• Manager faces need to protect players for Watford on SaturdaySteve Bruce has pledged to do everything possible to lead Newcastle to domestic cup glory, but his plans are being tested early by injuries and the need to protect players before hosting Watford in the Premier League on Saturday.Newcastle entertain Leicester City on Wednesday night not having won a major trophy since the European Fairs Cup in 1969. Moreover they are without a domestic prize since 1955 but, under Mike Ashley’s ownership, cups have been low priority with a series of managers apparently happy to accept early exits.Shortly after succeeding Rafael Benítez, who was not prepared to risk Premier League survival in exchange for cup runs, Bruce vowed to change this mindset – yet he seems set to make wholesale changes against Brendan Rodgers’s side.Six players – Allan Saint-Maximin, Christian Atsu, Miguel Almirón, Joelinton, Jamaal Lascelles and Fabian Schär – returned from the restorative 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday nursing injuries and appear unlikely to be risked.With a hamstring injury likely to force Saint-Maximin out for a minimum of three weeks and Andy Carroll and Dwight Gayle sidelined, Bruce’s attacking options have contracted and he is expected to start Yoshinori Muto as Newcastle’s lone forward.Sean Longstaff, who is regaining full fitness following a serious knee injury, is likely to be rested, leaving room for his younger brother Matty in midfield.“It’s a squad game now,” Bruce said. “We have 25 players and I still expect to pick a team which is hopefully going to take us through.”Even so, Bruce will be making more changes than he would have liked in the wake of a win which defused the considerable criticism – and mounting pressure –surrounding his opening two Premier League defeats against Arsenal and Norwich.“The criticism is something we’ll always have to live with here but the players knew they didn’t play well enough against Norwich, but, on any given day, that can happen to you,” Bruce said. “The response was the most important thing and it was terrific. By beating Tottenham away they’ve set the standard we now need to maintain.”Joelinton, scorer of the winning goal at Spurs, has a groin injury and is among those ranked extremely doubtful for Leicester’s visit, as is Almirón. “It’s different with a muscle injury,” Bruce said. “If you’re carrying a knock or bruise then of course you might be able to be patched up . But if you have a soft tissue injury like big Joe or Almiron, with his ankle, then it’s always a problem. Those are the ones you worry about.”The manager was particularly disappointed by the recurrence of hamstring trouble sustained by the former Nice winger Saint-Maximin. “We’ll let the bleed settle on his hamstring and scan it again,” Bruce said. “It’s been a frustrating start for him but, if it’s not too serious, we’d be looking at three weeks out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/595996fcc2640b9d50767922e5b9ff1192735e3b/0_119_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=848f35c8edea841e0647f98167ec881b","title":"the fiver bury and a disgraceful turn of events","story":"Sign up now!

Unless Dale concludes a sale of the club by 5pm BST, the club can expect to be expelled from the Football League. Less than 90 minutes before that deadline, the only potential buyers, C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk announced it was “unable to proceed” with a takeover bid that was apparently a sporting risk too far, meaning the end for the League One club could scarcely look more nigh.It is, of course, a disgraceful turn of events for which the English Football League overlords should feel thoroughly ashamed but clearly don’t. “Following a period of due diligence, C\u0026ampN have opted not to progress matters,” the League said in a statement that would never have been needed if it had done some sort of due diligence of its own. Meanwhile, a few miles up the road at Bolton Wanderers, the Trotters face the same deadline to prove a takeover is done or provide reasons why they require an extension to avoid joining their fellow third-tier outfit in potential oblivion. “The current situation cannot continue,” said the EFL in another statement oozing its trademark sanctimony.

Tourists are arriving on the beach in droves, preparing to spend the day sunbathing and taking boat rides. Behind them, enormous marabou storks on spindly grey legs are pacing the beach, waiting for scraps.Nearby, a group of women scan the horizon, looking for the fishing boats that will soon arrive with their daily catch.But there’s something else on the horizon too, a sheet of water hyacinth pulled over the surface of the lake. The leaves of the floating plant extending like an oversized green shag carpet, rolling gently in the wind.Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), an aquatic plant native to South America, first appeared in countries in Africa in the early 1900s. Scientists there dubbed it the “world’s worst aquatic weed”, after it spread from the Cape in the early 1900s and started clogging up major dams and rivers.In east Africa, the nefarious invader arrived with Belgian colonists in Rwanda, who liked the look of its glossy leaves and delicate purple flowers floating in their garden ponds.But by the 1980s, it had slipped out of Rwanda via the Kagera river and made its way downstream to Lake Victoria.There, with no natural predators and perfect temperature conditions, the plant began gobbling up open space, choking off fishing routes and providing a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes. But for women like Keita, it has meant dwindling income, as the boats that once brought silver lake fish to shore by the hundreds struggled to navigate the clogged waters.But water hyacinth isn’t her only headache. Like most women here, to smoke the fish she buys, Keita must gather huge quantities of firewood, sometimes walking as far as 10km each way to collect enough kindling to complete her work. And each day as she cooks, she breathes in the thick, grey woodfire smoke.“I have had chest complications a number of times in the last years,” says Keita, who is chairperson of the local fishmongers’ association.About three out of four families in Kenya depend on wood or charcoal to cook their daily meals, and the rate is even higher in rural areas, Kenya’s latest demographic and health survey shows.Using solid fuels like these for cooking increases indoor pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that about 14,300 Kenyans die annually from conditions linked to indoor air pollution – most of which is caused by cooking and heating sources, the most recent estimates released in 2009 show.Outside Keita’s home on the shores of Lake Victoria, piles of cleared water hyacinth left to rot were a common site. But buried in those decaying waxy leaves was a renewable energy gold mine.It turns out the floating plant isn’t just good at being abundant – its foliage also contains a high ratio of carbon to nitrogen. It’s a magic combination that has captivated researchers’ imaginations since as early as the 1980s when, across the world, they began to explore its potential as a biofuel. Just about 4kg of the dried plant was enough to cater for a large family’s daily energy needs, early research predicted.In 2014, Nigerian academics announced they had got better yields of the gas when they mixed the plant with sanitised chicken manure. A few years later, Kenyan scientists confirmed what their Nigerian peers and others had already found: animal dung worked to power charge the process of converting the weed into gas. In India, scientists took this idea and ran with it, mixing water hyacinth with the more famous Cannabis sativa, the same family of plants that marijuana comes from, as a proposed answer for periodic shortages of cow dung.In 2018, the technology came to Dunga promising a two-for-one solution to the dual menaces of the water hyacinth and dependence on firewood. The community received two donated biogas digesters – machines that would transform a mix of water hyacinth and cow dung into biogas for cooking, as well as material for other household tasks such as incubating chicks and purifying water.The “digesters” work a bit like a stomach. Food goes in one end – think of it as a mouth – and over the next 20 to 30 days, it ferments and breaks down, giving off gas that comes out the other end. From there, the clean-burning gas is piped to the point of use, just like traditional domestic gas.Kenya’s Biogas International company installed the stoves in partnership with the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability.The project will test whether biogas can provide an effective alternative to firewood and charcoal in rural Kenyan communities.The programme is only months old but, anecdotally, it seems to be working. Keita says the members of her fishmongers’ association are already getting sick less often. And because they don’t have to devote hours a day to walking long distances to collect firewood, they’re making more money as well.Kanyiva Muindi is an epidemiologist and air pollution research fellow at the African Population and Health Research Centre in Nairobi. She says families who switch to the smokeless cooking method could expect fewer respiratory issues and even some forms of cancer because where there’s smoke, there’s PAHs – polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a carcinogen released during burning of certain materials such as wood, corn cobs or cow dung, researchers recently reported.Women, young girls and children are particularly vulnerable because they spend so much time in the kitchen or outside over cooking fires. Worldwide, scientists are still exploring whether PAHs are linked to pockets of high rates of oesophageal cancer in the country.How much better the biogas stoves will be for the community’s health still needs more research, says Dominic Kahumbu Wanjihia, Biogas International’s chief executive. But unless the price of the digesters drops, it’s pretty clear that most communities will never be able to afford the machines, which sell for about $750.Kanyiva says affordability is a challenge worth addressing, given the huge health and environmental dangers posed by “dirty” fuels such as wood, charcoal and kerosene. If biogas could become affordable on a large scale, she says it “would be life-changing for millions on the African continent and beyond”.For Keita, meanwhile, one unexpected benefit of the stoves has been the way they have changed her view of water hyacinth. For years, she had regarded it as little more than a menace. But now, she says, “the hyacinth is becoming a useful resource!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7356f79bcf35b9e9a6d565f50b1f7e8c02372df3/0_1014_4976_2986/master/4976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeca33f632beb08a3ed054fc14437c7c","title":"ethiopians yemen saudi arabia in pictures","story":"Escaping poverty and drought, Ethiopians are making the dangerous sea crossing from Djibouti to Yemen and then on foot to the Saudi border.

Yet, she is “awfully addicted to infantile games” like Candy Crush or Angry Birds.“What horrifies me is that I spend essentially a whole day on my phone each week” said Jennifer Corlington in Sitges, Spain. She is making an effort not to use her phone in front of her kids in an attempt to lead by example. “Either we’re with them or we’re on our phones but you can’t really do both,” she says.Ashleigh Young, from Wellington, says “I do the classic mindless, almost catatonic scrolling of Twitter and often it makes me feel stressed or just flat, so I have now deleted Twitter from my phone and just have it for my laptop, so it feels a bit more conscious.” She adds: “Maybe I should spend time differently, but then I’d have to face reality and that’s not a great option these days.”Mick Greer, from Saigon, said he has “no desire to learn the tuba or write the next great novel”, so he is not planning to change how he uses his one hour of daily screen time.Other responders were happy with their phone usage because they found their use of it was intentional, and spending four or five hours a day on it made sense to them.“Anyone who might judge a person for looking at their phone is clearly not thinking of the vast number of things they could be doing with it”, said Victoria from Swindon. Her daily eight hours helps improves her quality of life, as she trades messages and banters over Discord with her friends living abroad. Nightly guided meditations help her get to sleep at night, and music and games help her get through a noisy commute.Then there are those who made the conscious choice to gear their use away from recreation — little to no fun, purely function.Natalie, from Birmingham, is embarrassed of her four hour time which racks up during her 40-minute train commute. She uses the Google Digital Wellbeing app to set timers on her commonly used apps. “I am now allowed only 15 minutes on Reddit and this is more than enough,” she discovered.Open headspace motivates reader Joseph Slater from Cambodia who reminds us what Rod Judkins wrote in The Art of Creative Thinking:There is an art to doing nothing, intensely. The geniuses of the twenty-first century will be those who can unplug from the unyielding flow of incoming communications: emails, texts, tweets, Facebook, phone calls, and on and on. There’s no hiding place from screens we work at them they entertain us … To work intensively for long periods you need to switch off occasionally for short periods.”Lee Rice, from St Asaph, decided to go back to the dark ages and sold his smartphone last year. He says “life is a million percent better with a dumb phone”.For others, like Judah from Oslo, keeping it simple has been enough: “The best solution is to put the phone down. Even gazing out the window on my commute would be more mentally productive.”The bottom line? If these responses say anything, it’s not about how much screen time you accumulate or how you use it, but rather how you feel about your use.Take a step back and consider your screen time: do you feel depressed about it? Do you know, deep down, that you’d rather learn Chinese or make pasta from scratch? Or are you happy being connected to your loved ones all day?Once you have your answer, go all the way and switch back to a Nokia brick. Or, keep your iPhone X if your eyes have developed an insatiable taste for blue light. If you’re happy, we’re happy.(But, we can agree that 12 hours is ludicrous, right?)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b0c2d66d1f814bbf8b88ba0bd884e084409ff1/0_472_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f1bf0abbdc1d671cae95cec7904e45","title":"cannabliss exercise class get high intensely uncomfortable cbd patch","story":"A CBD patch worn on the upper arm is supposed to manage the pain of intense stretches. It is not managing mineTurning up to a Gymbox class called Cannabliss (membership from £73, gymbox) is my twofold nightmare. First, group exercise has always struck me as torture plus humiliation. Second, drug talk makes me feel 107 years old. When I hear anyone rhapsodising about hydroponics or closed-loop extraction or how to core an apple bong, I have a tremendous urge to shout: “Why didn’t you stay in school, you’re obviously smart?” Even if they’re in their early 40s. I suppose if we rebranded Stem subjects as Seed and Buds, we could stop failing our weed heads. Anyway, the idea of enduring their company while on a crosstrainer makes me want to pull a … whitey, is it?In my long shorts, I may as well have turned up to class wearing a baseball cap that reads: “How do you do, fellow kids.” I also arrive late, to fit in better with the apathetic stoners. It is my first mistake. They are all there, in their Lululemon and Nike athleisure gear, fit young professionals who regularly go to the gym and let their hair down with an extra broccoli floret at dinner. No one is here to get high. Cannabliss is a “recovery-focused class with the added benefit of CBD patches to help with inflammation”.The teacher glares at me for the disruption. I select a mat too close to his, having no choice because the other spots are taken. He hands me a translucent, spearmint-coloured square to apply to my upper arm. The fact that I have a photographer with me isn’t ideal, either. I am already feeling intensely uncomfortable, and we haven’t even begun.Perhaps we should back up, and explain CBD at this point. Cannabidiol has started springing up everywhere, in varied forms. In essence, it is just one of more than 100 chemical compounds that proliferate in the sweet flowers of Mary Jane and her wacky baccy. It is completely distinct from TLC, who were never able to match the highs of Waterfalls and No Scrubs, although Unpretty was pretty good. Hang on, hang on. *Squints* Oh, THC is the psychoactive element in cannabis – the main bit that gets you high, and there is little to none of it in CBD products. They are legal and said to help with pain relief, inflammation, epilepsy and depression. It is making use of the medicinal effects of cannabis, minus all the fun.I’m certainly not having fun at Cannabliss. I had hoped a class with the word “recovery” in the description would basically be lying down and listening to classical music, but in fact it is a series of intense stretches and body manipulations to help muscles recover after workouts. Rolling crossed thighs down foam rollers, putting a squash ball under our shoulders and riding all our weight on it, holding planks and twisting our cores. Sweat runs into my eyes relentlessly. Gimme the apple bong, I think. There is no drug talk, the patch being there to help manage the pain, then boost our recovery over the following 24 hours. It is not managing mine well enough, and I haven’t done the workout immediately prior to this that the masochists around me presumably have.I do think it is doing something, though. CBD patches are a more effective form of transferring cannabidiol into your bloodstream, unlike gummies or water infusions, which break down in the stomach along with your dignity. As I exercise, I can feel a light tingling under the patch. This is not as extreme as when you apply toothpaste to your swimsuit area, but more tingly than the beginnings of a cold sore. While CBD is not yet clinically proven, doctors and scientists are optimistic about its benefits. It is generally agreed there is something here worthy of study, and a weight of anecdotal evidence, not all of it from rock-loving dudes called Kevin or Cody or Sparrow.As far as this lazy, pain-averse, 107-year-old square is concerned, it is easier to not exercise so hard that you need to take either the recovery class or use the patches. Driven young professionals will find Cannabliss dope. After an hour of it, I’m ready to slap a DNR notice on my back.CBD is a pleasant thing to say. It rolls off the tongue, like BBC or DNA or FBI.CBD? CBA more like. 35"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10d918861c93f36ffbf8d47028b7f80645b0633f/0_34_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa38ae7139153d88930e61ae6f4dda9","title":"bret stephens new york times columinst bed bug twitter","story":"Free speech advocate Bret Stephens emailed David Karpf’s boss to complain about ‘bedbug’ joke – and then quit Twitter after being widely mocked Bret Stephens would like a word with your manager. Or possibly a good fumigator.The New York Times columnist, who portrays himself as a defender of free speech, was at the center of a social media meltdown on Monday which ended up with Stephens deleting his Twitter account and, once again, bemoaning the lack of civility of his critics.It began with a story about an apparent bedbug infestation at the New York Times building. Riffing on the newspaper’s predicament, David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, poked fun at Stephens on Twitter on Monday evening. The post received nine likes and zero retweets.What followed was as close to the perfect Streisand effect as one could imagine. Stephens, who was not tagged in the original post, emailed Karpf, and copied in the provost of the university, in an apparent attempt to get Karpf in trouble.And then it went viral.Karpf shared news of the scolding on Twitter, in a post that has now been retweeted 7,500 times and liked 48,500 (and counting).After much prodding, Karpf shared the contents of Stephens’ email.Stephens wrote: “I’m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people – people they’ve never met – on Twitter. I think you’ve set a new standard. I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a ‘bedbug’ to my face. That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part.”Karpf told the Washington Post: “He not only thinks I should be ashamed of what I wrote, he thinks that I should also get in trouble for it. That’s an abuse of his power.”Stephens also said there was a “bad history” of “being analogized to insects that goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes”.Back-channel emails have become a burgeoning genre for New York Times employees, echoing a similar exchange between the recently demoted editor Jonathan Weisman and the writer Roxane Gay. Weisman angrily emailed Gay, her assistant, and Gay’s publisher to demand an apology after she criticized on Twitter Weisman’s critique of a congressional candidate of color.Stephens had previously scolded on email the Deadspin writer Samer Kalaf, who had called Stephens’ column on Gaza border protests last year “drive-by dogshit”.Stephens has been frequently lambasted since joining the Times from the Wall Street Journal in 2017. His many bad takes include climate scepticism, a 2016 WSJ column in which he used the phrase “disease of the Arab mind”, and his regular hobbyhorses, which essentially amount to slight variations on three topics:• People on Twitter are mean to me.• Kids on campus these days are the real ideological fascists.• Democrats should work harder to become Republicans to convince Republicans like me to vote for them.Karpf, the GWU professor, told Splinter: “I assume the thing that set him off here is that I’m a white guy with a PhD, and I think it offends his sensibility that fellow upper-standing white guys are saying mean things about him. I guess there’s some power structure he thinks I violated.”On Tuesday, Stephens announced he was leaving Twitter. “Time to do what I long ago promised to do. Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt. Thanks to all my followers, but I’m deactivating this account.”Previously Stephens had penned a column about how bad Twitter was for the soul. He wrote in 2017: “This is the column in which I formally forswear Twitter for good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a7c44a26cc0f8373cc51cbd55fe490fcdcaf01f/0_50_2514_1508/master/2514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c918535b468e9491566091180c47c87","title":"gary crosby godfather british jazz renaissance bassist ella fitzgerald","story":"The godfather of the UK jazz renaissance discovered the music under house arrest, and spent decades blazing a trail. He talks about accepting a Queen’s medal – and his near-fatal strokeIf you find yourself lost in the catacomb-like basement of London’s Southbank Centre on a weekend, you’ll probably stumble across Gary Crosby holding court, addressing a circle of teenagers on everything from the history of reggae in the Caribbean diaspora to British jazz in the 1980s.On the sweltering Saturday I meet him, Crosby is running 20 young musicians through the waypoints of Jamaican jazz, from Haitian carnival rhythms to poet Louise Bennett-Coverley’s patois, via the Skatalites and Bob Marley. He paces around the room while the students eagerly tap away on their phones – not texting but taking notes. Then he launches into a dub-laden take on the Herbie Hancock standard Cantaloupe Island.There is a quietly commanding quality to Crosby, which is perhaps down to his four decades as a bassist. In the mid-1980s, he co-founded the Jazz Warriors, a group that showcased the early careers of seminal musicians such as saxophonist Courtney Pine and vibes player Orphy Robinson. In the 90s, Crosby led a renowned weekly jam session at Camden’s Jazz Cafe. Now 64, he has spent so long cradling his instrument that he has taken on its soothingly resonant qualities, exuding an easygoing charm. Last month, he became the first jazz recipient of the Queen’s Medal for Music, adding to his OBE and topping off what he calls “the best and the worst 18 months of my life”.Life has not always run smoothly for Crosby. Born to Windrush-generation parents, he grew up in a disaffected black community in London. “There was black power happening, there was talk of Babylon, and a lot of young black men had to be intimidating because inside they were terrified of what might happen if they let their guard down.” He had his own brush with the law at 15, when he was arrested on suspicion of carrying cannabis during a police raid at a Soho club and, as a child, placed under house arrest. He was not charged, but while stuck at home, he discovered jazz. “I remember one night when everyone was out and Ella Fitzgerald came on the TV,” he says. “Her voice sent this rush of feeling through me, and since then I’ve been hooked on pursuing that in jazz.”Back in London, Crosby and his partner, Janine Irons, set up Tomorrow’s Warriors, to encourage a greater ersity of young musicians to enter jazz. In the 28 years since the free programme – now based at the Southbank Centre – started, they have mentored thousands of musicians. Alumni include the saxophonist and rapper Soweto Kinch, and many London jazz artists including Theon Cross, Nubya Garcia and the Mercury prize-nominated Cassie Kinoshi.The London jazz revival of the past few years, “feels special because there’s no arrogance about it. These kids just want to play,” he says. “I don’t give a shit about the ‘London jazz scene’ – I just want more musicians to be able to create a lasting career and leave something behind.”The question of a legacy has been on Crosby’s mind since he suffered a near-fatal stroke in January 2018. “For three days I was really in a bad way. Knowing everything can go in a flash has given me so much more drive to finish what I started.” That means lobbying for arts funding – something he feels is as essential as the NHS – as well as passing on the reins of Tomorrow’s Warriors to the next generation. “I haven’t been able to play much myself since the stroke,” he says. “So I need to think about my own music now, because I’ve put that aside for 30 years.”Crosby says it was a difficult decision to accept his Queen’s Medal. “I haven’t always been in favour of the royal family,” he says. “But I spoke to all of my friends about it and realised that I’m not accepting it for me. It’s for Tomorrow’s Warriors, and for anything to get more funds and to raise its profile I need to turn up and put on that suit.”That suit will be donned again this month when Crosby’s recently formed Nu Civilisation Orchestra, made up of Tomorrow’s Warriors alumni, headline a Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall. “This is the future of the music: creating an orchestra that can hopefully gain a residency and keep people employed for years to come,” he says. “We need to not get distracted with the political bullshit but trust in the music – that’s where the humanity lies.”• Prom 54: Duke Ellington’s Sacred Music is at Royal Albert Hall, London, on 29 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b32dd24b914a62e5e72e1bb7a872491ca10a260/0_860_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f407a4f65312c496ced5d3be8b8e63e8","title":"kinks dave davies grand arcade finchley london","story":"Dave Davies supports attempt to stop arcade home to quirky shops being demolished“God save little shops,” sang the Kinks on their 1968 single The Village Green Preservation Society. More than half a century later, that wish lives on for the founder member and guitarist Dave Davies, who is fighting to save a historic shopping arcade near where he grew up in north London, which is expected to be demolished by developers and replaced with high-rise flats.The still-touring Davies has stepped into a battle being repeated across the UK as investors seize on struggling high streets in towns and suburbs that have been battered by online shopping and rising business rates, and seek to turn them into housing.Policymakers believe a crisis last year during which the number of shops lying empty rose by more than 7,500 can be halted by turning them into homes. In the past five years, there has been a net loss of more than 1,000 independent shops, according to the Local Data Company (LDC).Davies, 72, joins those who fear the changes risk ripping iniduality and identity out of local communities. He is backing calls to save the art deco Grand Arcade in North Finchley, which was a short trolleybus ride from where he grew up in Muswell Hill with his brother Ray Davies.Its eccentric row of shops once included a music store where Davies bought guitar strings. Now there is a jeweller’s, a bric-a-brac shop, an immigration lawyer, a craft shop and a photo studio. All this is facing oblivion despite the government’s heritage body, Historic England, declaring the 1937 building “one of the highlights of the town centre”.Speaking on a visit to the arcade last week, Davies said: “Little shops matter because people matter.“Feelings are attached to things, not just people. Certain clothes in little shops. It’s more personalised, more inidual, more quirky. You get more unusual things. Some people don’t care, but I do. Ray was right about it before anyone else on the Village Green album.”But sometimes the stores are taken over by other occupants. At the Grand Arcade, the Art Against Knives charity has occupied what was once the music shop, in an attempt to encourage vulnerable young people off the streets with music production sessions and a nail bar.If places such as the Grand Arcade go, “we lose personality and inidualism”, said Davies, as he riffled through LPs by Doris Day, Shakatak and Felix Mendelssohn in the Green Room charity shop.“I think we are at a time now when we need to celebrate inidualism rather than trying to make everything the same,” he said. “This sort of place brings people together. I think about new people or immigrants moving to the area and they would love to own a little shop rather than being stuck in a big box.”The local planning strategy calls for the building’s replacement with up to 12 storeys of flats and offices above shops. It cites “tough economic conditions and changing consumer habits” as altering the face of the high street, and suggests more leisure, office and residential uses.Jonathan Joseph, the company’s head, denied there was any conflict of interest. He said Joseph Partners had no say in the recommendations to demolish the arcade and said the jury was still out on what would happen, with a consultation on detailed plans to start next month.“Is it a pleasant piece of architecture? Yes. Is it historically important? No,” he said.Ian Dunn, a local graphic designer who is campaigning to save the arcade, said: “This is a unique part of North Finchley. You have to have a bohemian funky place like this for people to express themselves. It can’t be all coffee shops. All we have up here now is McDonald’s and KFC and their litter all over our floors.”Mukesh Rathod, who runs the 21-year-old Gold Leaf jeweller’s, said the council’s suggestion the arcade was struggling was “rubbish”.He added: “There is no need to close this. It’s all very well having the big shops like Next and Primark, but if this goes they won’t survive because the arcade brings people here.”Marissa Ajapidi, who runs Recycled Inspirations, an arts and crafts shop, said she was so busy she was expanding into the neighbouring unit. “It’s crazy,” she said. “This is something totally different.”Ray and Dave Davies, the fraternal driving force behind the Kinks, are back in tandem after decades of animosity and have produced a large number of new ideas for songs, some of which are “really good”, Dave Davies has said.The band’s pioneering lead guitarist, who is now based in New Jersey, has been in the UK working with his brother. “Me and Ray are talking. Or talkingish,” he said.It has been enough for the pair to write together again, 55 years after they changed the face of pop music with You Really Got Me, which introduced a new distorted guitar sound achieved by repeatedly slashing the paper cone of Dave Davies’ £10 guitar speaker with a razor blade. They subsequently fell out repeatedly – including over who wielded the blade.“I’ve been working with Ray,” said Dave Davies. “We’ve been working on some ideas. There’s a lot of it. Some of it is OK and some of it is really good and needs tarting up, knocking into shape as it were.“It’s going OK. We’re getting on OK, that’s the main thing. He can be cheeky. He wants what he wants. It’s just brother shit. When the music works, everything else is sod it, it will be all right.”The Kinks are rereleasing their 1969 album Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) in October, but there is no schedule yet for the release of any new material. Less than three years ago, Dave Davies described his 75-year-old brother in an interview as “sly, manipulative and nasty”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a651dbd4fc3f4789eabd39a35c14c18c01a06341/0_38_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c091d44afef9cf5231568378c0d63f29","title":"prom 50 orchestre de paris harding review widmann beethoven schumann","story":" Royal Albert Hall, London Jörg Widmann’s Babylon Suite is anarchic but infectiously enjoyable, framed here by pristine Beethoven and SchumannJörg Widmann’s opera Babylon, a bombastic, Stockhausen-baiting mix of myth, spirituality, human sacrifice and singing genitalia, had its premiere in Munich seven years ago. It has yet to be staged in the UK until then we have to make do with his Babylon Suite, already heard in Cardiff and Birmingham. This performance by the Orchestre de Paris and its outgoing music director Daniel Harding was its first in London.It’s a barnstormer of a piece, wheeling through music from the opera in an unbroken 30-minute work for a huge kitchen-sink orchestra but no singers. Initially, the music grows swiftly from a single accordion line into a layered, chaotic whirl. It’s the kind of opening passage that promises cataclysm – and that’s what we get, although not in the brutal way we might anticipate.Instead, things get progressively more tuneful: first a glimpse of soupy Rachmaninov, then an impish, Straussian solo violin, a slow klezmer-style waltz and an oompah band playing Oktoberfest songs. By this time, the Widmann prism distorting all this melody has all but dissolved, and towards the end the waltz returns in a way that is so Hollywood it’s as if the credits are rolling. The final reiteration is climactic, but oddly marmoreal and therefore almost sinister.Taken out of the context of the opera, it is a baffling piece but it’s archly anarchic and infectiously fun, the work of a virtuoso composer clearly enjoying himself. The Paris players were enjoying it, too.There was also much geniality in the works that framed the Widmann, from the tenderly shaped lines of Schumann’s Genoveva overture to the thanksgiving music at the end of a careful performance of Beethoven’s Symphony No 6. The orchestral sound was pristine and beautifully blended, almost to a fault. Harding is leaving one French organisation in good shape next year he’ll join another – a qualified pilot, he’s planning to take a sabbatical to work for Air France. But while neatness and precision may be exactly what we want from the person flying our plane, this Beethoven could have used a little bit of turbulence.• Available on BBC Sounds.

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs ide in the Irish sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u0027s customs union permanently if the UK \u0026amp EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.\u0026nbspA legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try and get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK\u0026nbspThis set out the British position that, if the backstop was to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration\u0026nbspThis emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it \u0027reduces the risk\u0027 of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Prime minister Boris Johnson\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspdeclared the Northern Ireland backstop “dead”\u0026nbspduring his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he re-negotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not re-open the Withdrawal Agreement for re-negotiation.\u0026nbspA senior source said they were unsure if the shift was substantive but said the openness had to be used to “prise open some space” for negotiations.Johnson will send his chief Brexit adviser, David Frost, to Brussels on Wednesday to continue discussions on alternatives to the backstop with senior EU officials, though No 10 played down the prospect of Frost presenting a concrete proposal for the reopening of negotiations.Johnson is expected to meet Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in Dublin early next week, a meeting which a Downing Street source described as “clearly crucial”.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, started a five-city Brexit tour of EU capitals on Tuesday to reinforce the importance of the backstop and Good Friday agreement for Ireland’s economic and social stability.Coveney’s EU offensive on the backstop would appear to counter some claims that the EU is showing new signs of flexibility on the measure after Johnson’s first appearance at a G7 summit, in Biarritz at the weekend.Speaking in Dublin before the trip and before a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart on Monday night, Coveney spoke of a diplomatic outreach programme to help other nations understand the “unique” impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland.Coveney is expected to repeat this message in Prague on Tuesday, in Paris on Wednesday, in Helsinki on Thursday and Friday, and in Warsaw on Sunday.Last week in Dublin, Coveney said it was not the case that the Irish government was refusing to talk to the UK, but said he would not be facilitating the UK in walking away from its commitments in the withdrawal agreement.Johnson also spoke to the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, by phone on Tuesday. Rutte said he told Johnson that the EU27 was “open to concrete proposals compatible with the withdrawal agreement: respect for the integrity of the single market and no hard border on the Irish isle”.A Downing Street spokeswoman said there had been “good discussions with EU leaders both last week in France and in Germany, and at the weekend”.The spokeswoman said Johnson believed there was now a “clear understanding” of the seriousness of the UK’s commitment to leave on 31 October.“He has also been setting out very clearly the reasons why the backstop is unacceptable to us,” the spokeswoman said. “What is clear is that if there is goodwill on both sides, and a determination to get things done, solutions to the backstop exist and the PM believes they should be discussed.”The date on which the Commons is likely to return from summer recess. It is the first date that MPs could hold a vote of no confidence in the new prime minister.

Organisers said more than 160 MPs from a range of parties signed the declaration.Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National party in the House of Commons, said the government posed a threat to the security of citizens, while Lucas said: “We will block what is nothing less than a coup.”Swinson said MPs had come together to make the point that they would not stand by while the government pursued a “catastrophic no-deal Brexit”.Although Conservative MPs were conspicuous by their absence from the event, Soubry, who left the Tories to join the Independent Group for Change, spoke on stage with McDonnell sat beside her.She said she hoped the history books would record their determination and courage and show there were those who acted while others stood by and did nothing.“You all know who the people of courage are and those who have failed to exercise it,” Soubry said. “They will stop you in the corridors and say, ‘Of course this is absolute madness’, but they will not go and do the right thing, which is to be true to their principles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Meanwhile Cornet has beaten Pegula 6-2, 6-3. Blinkova goes 3-0 up and can have a free hit at Osaka’s serve now, really. She’s looking very positive and sharp. Tsitsipas and Rublev remain on serve as the second set reaches its business end.And she takes the first, so Osaka is in early trouble. Blinkova, the world No 84, is 2-0 up in the first set.Popyrin is now two sets up against Delbonis. Meanwhile Osaka is being given a good early test by Blinkova here – the underdog looks aggressive at the net and has two break points ...Kukushkin completed that turnaround against Bautista Agut, taking the second set 6-1 so it’s one apiece. And another Kazakh has taken inspiration! Alexander Bublik went down 6-2 to Santiago Giraldo in their first set but has taken the second 6-2.Now Osaka is underway against the Russian, Blinkova. No boos today! Blinkova serves first and it’s a nice start, with some good long rallies. It reaches deuce.Here’s our first completed match of the day: Bencic defeats Minella 6-3, 6-2.Tsitsipas has broken back here – 2-2 in the second – and this could completely galvanise his confidence, which was clearly lacking earlier.Men’s 24th seed Matteo Berretini is a set up, 6-1, against Richard Gasquet. And Bautista Agut, who won comfortably enough in his first set against Kukushkin, is now 5-0 down in the second!Bit of a turnaround in that Vikhlyantseva v Gorges match. Remember how Gorges lost the first set 6-1? She’s just won the second by that very score!Osaka gets underway quite soon, by the way, so we’ll have a big focus on that match before long ...Rublev breaks in the second set! And it comes from a needless Tsitsipas double fault. He is firmly in the driving seat here now, leading 3-1.Kvitova won the first set against Allertova Bencic is 3-1 up in the second set against Minella and closing in on a quickish victory.Only a sprinkling of fans watching this one, which is a shame as it’s good fun. Rublev came under some pressure in his first service game of the second set but held to 30 and it’s 1-1.Jelena Ostapenko, always a tricky prospect, leads Aleksandra Krunic by a set. So does Garbine Muguruza against Alison Riske.Rublev takes the first set 6-4 against Tsitsipas with a superb ace. So we could see a seed on the way out as things stand. This was one of the toughest first-round ties Tsitsipas could have faced, to be fair, and he’s found Rublev to be in excellent nick. He’s looked very smooth throughout.Men’s tenth seed Roberto Bautista Agut, who has never got beyond the fifth round here, is a set up over the Kazakh player Mikhail Kukushkin. Meanwhile Tsitsipas certainly seems to be over that early wobble but Rublev will now serve for the set ...Bencic has battled back against Minella to win that first set 6-3.

She’s the sixth seed and, at 4-2 up in the first set against her compatriot Denisa Allertova, is looking good.Tsitsipas does seem to have got over that early knee problem and is showing signs of looking sharp around the net. He earns two break-back points ... the first goes begging and then he totally miscues a massive swing at Rublev’s second serve to squander the next one. Rublev sails though deuce for 4-2.Popyrin has taken the first set 6-1 against Delbonis. That was quick! Almost as rapid is Natalia Vikhlyantseva, who has stormed to a 6-1 opening set lead over Julia Gorges.Rublev is all over the court at the moment, looking on very good form. He’s just held to love and leads 3-1.Bencic has broken back against Minella, while Popyrin now leads Delbonis 4-1 in the first set.Rublev holds his serve to deuce and has control of the first set here – he leads 2-0.Greg emails: “What price a Williams-Osaka rematch in the final?

I’m quietly optimistic for her but don’t want to make bold predictions. She’s certainly got a chance of making a big, big impact. Here’s a very relevant piece by Tumaini Carayol:Kyle Edmund is speaking on the telly:“I’m feeling excited, had a good week’s training, really enjoyed it and feel like I’ve been progressing nicely. What I’ve got right now is the best I’ve had in a while so it’s just about going and seeing what I’ve got out there on the match court. The conditions here suit me well, the balls fly off, I’ve always enjoyed it. I’m confident in terms of belief in myself in my game but I’m a realist, I haven’t won a huge amount of matches but feel I’ve also done a lot of good stuff.”He’s not gone past the second round in any of his last four grand slams – let’s hope for a revival here.Here’s a scene-setter for Osaka’s big return, courtesy of Bryan Armen Graham – who’ll be with you later too:Yes, Serena was on sizzling form.

This means planning rules will be relaxed to enable existing ground-based masts to be strengthened without prior approval to enable sites to be upgraded for 5G and for mast-sharing.”She stressed the need to “get the balance right” between preserving the “sacrosanct” countryside and improving connectivity.The £30m 5G competition will select up to 10 rural locations to run trials of 5G-related technology, which would involve superfast 5G test networks being set up.The government said it hoped the programme, named the Rural Connected Communities competition, could help stimulate investment in 5G and help countryside communities take advantage of the technology.Similar schemes have already been set up in Orkney to remotely monitor salmon fisheries and improve the efficiency of wind farms, and in Shropshire, where 5G trials have been used to help the farming industry with targeted crop-spraying and soil analysis with drones and tractors.Morgan said: “We’re investing millions so the whole country can grasp the opportunities and economic benefits of next-generation 5G technology.“In modern Britain, people expect to be connected wherever they are. And so we’re committed to securing widespread mobile coverage and must make sure we have the right planning laws to give the UK the best infrastructure to stay ahead.”Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said: “This funding falls far short of the ambitious rollout we need to boost our digital infrastructure nationwide. 5G and full fibre will be the basis of the innovative, green technologies that will underpin our future economy, but the UK’s digital infrastructure is lagging embarrassingly behind. “This government must take bolder, faster action to deliver the digital infrastructure we need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd1e0a88c36dd2e39a8c92eb12022fe37e5d4728/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=226858f2a9b1a501c7e9e46ab5044a3d","title":"ringing the changes how britains red phone boxes are being given new life","story":"It’s a design classic, but in these days of ubiquitous mobile phones, only 10,000 of the red kiosks remain on the streets. Can they survive the next decade?John Farmer, who describes himself as an activist shareholder, is a man with a mission – to save Britain’s red phone boxes. These were once a feature of every high street in the country, but now number only 10,000 or so (and half of those are decorative rather than operational). At the recent annual general meeting of British Telecom, which even in the age of the mobile phone has a statutory obligation to maintain a payphone network, Farmer demanded that more be done to maintain the traditional red boxes. It was a point he has made at past AGMs – always, he says, to audience applause.In 2015 the traditional red phone box was voted the greatest British design of all time, ahead of the Routemaster bus, the Spitfire, the union jack and Concorde. It was designed in 1924 by the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, whose other creations include Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral and Battersea and Bankside power stations. Many believe Scott’s design echoes the tomb that the architect Sir John Soane built for his wife in 1815.In his 1989 monograph on phone boxes, the architectural historian Gavin Stamp called Scott’s cast-iron box “a classical design of refined sophistication and timeless elegance”. Stamp was a great enthusiast for Scott’s boxes and led a campaign to preserve them after they ceased production in 1968.In his book he lauds Scott’s original design, designated Kiosk No 2 (usually abbreviated to K2) by the General Post Office, which was then responsible for the phone network. “The Kiosk No 2 was a miniature building,” he writes. Scott’s K2 design, easily identified by its small, square windows, was superseded in 1936 by his K6, which was smaller and had larger, horizontal windows to let more light into the box. The K2 had never caught on outside London because it was expensive, but the cheaper K6 was adopted nationally and by the late 1960s, when the utilitarian K8 was introduced, designed by the architect Bruce Martin, there were more than 70,000 in use across the country.There are still numerous Scott kiosks in central London, many of which have been listed as historically or architecturally significant – a response to the destruction of many boxes by the newly formed British Telecom in the 1980s. Remarkably Scott’s original wooden prototype still stands outside the Royal Academy in Piccadilly. Across the UK, more than 3,000 kiosks have been listed, including all the K2s, so there is no danger of them disappearing from Britain’s streets. Neil Scoresby, BT’s general manager for payphones, tells me a revolution in payphones is under way, reflecting the fact that only about 30,000 calls a day are now made from them. Over the next decade, most of the current 31,000 street kiosks (they are mostly ugly, post-Scott designs) will be swept away and replaced by three metre-tall InLink pillars and other devices that combine free calls with wi-fi services and are funded by advertising, but about 2,500 red boxes will be retained and converted for digital use.The fact there were once more than 70,000 red kiosks and now only 10,000 remain on the streets suggests that a lot of boxes have disappeared. In the 1970s and 80s, many were melted down, but gradually aficionados such as Stamp fought back and the boxes’ aesthetic (and indeed monetary) value started to be recognised. Since 2008, rather than remove decommissioned ones that have not been listed, BT has allowed local councils and charities to repurpose them under its adopt-a-kiosk scheme. More than 5,000 have been adopted.Many now contain defibrillators, with the Community Heartbeat Trust leading the way in advising local authorities on conversion. The trust has adopted 1,300 boxes, more than half of which have been converted to house defibrillators. Other uses for the boxes are rich and varied. Book-swap points that double as miniature libraries are popular. The village of Marton cum Grafton in North Yorkshire was one of the pioneers, opening a mini-library in 2010 another was opened in the London borough of Lewisham in 2013. I visited the latter and was impressed by the range of books. Not just airport fodder, but novels by Orhan Pamuk and Henning Mankell, an ancient book of English poetry and the catalogue of the Mezipatra Queer film festival, with text in Czech and English.The box was adopted by the Brockley Society and is now looked after by Susan Bennett and Tom Simpson, although Bennett says it is largely self-managing. People bring books in, take the odd one away and take it upon themselves to tidy up the seven shelves. The Lewisham “microlibrary” was started by the artist Sebastian Handley. He has now left the area, but the idea has been carried on. One thing that worried me about BT’s adopt-a-kiosk scheme was whether some ideas might founder when the original volunteers moved on or lost their enthusiasm. By only allowing councils and charities, rather than iniduals, to adopt, BT hopes to ensure continuity, but I still think there could be problems further down the line. Who will be looking after these boxes in 50 years’ time, and making sure they get a fresh coat of “currant-red” paint?Art galleries in old phone boxes are also popular – an idea pioneered by the Gallery on the Green in Settle, north Yorkshire, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. “A group of residents thought it would be a shame for the box to go, and the idea of a gallery came up,” says Mike Smith, one of the half-dozen local people who keep it afloat. “The thought that it would probably be the smallest one in the world was kicked around and Guinness World Records was approached, but they said they weren’t interested in definitively ruling on it, so the Carlsberg advert was used instead … probably the smallest one. That generated a lot of publicity at the time of the launch in 2009.”Attempts have been made to monetise some boxes, in partnership with the Red Kiosk Company, which has bought 124 boxes from BT under the adopt-a-box scheme (BT sells them for a nominal £1, although it retains a residual interest in their use in an effort to ensure its brand is protected). The company gets planning permission for traders to use the boxes, and charges about £300 a month to rent a box.Mustafa Mehmet runs a coffee stall in a kiosk in Hampstead, north London. He originally did the same thing in west London, but says he was driven out by Hounslow council’s insistence that he have a street traders’ licence. The problem comes when kiosk traders spill over on to the pavement, which is almost inevitable – try selling coffee to a customer with both buyer and seller inside the box. Hounslow council, he says, insisted the transaction should take place inside the box Camden council, under whose jurisdiction Mehmet is now trading, allows a bit of leeway.Phone repair company Lovefone has a kiosk in Holborn, central London, in which it repairs cracked iPhone screens. The Lovefone technician who works there, Fouad Choaibi, loves it. “This is my office,” he says. He has been based in the box for two and a half years and has embedded himself in the community, making himself indispensable to locals with cracked iPhones. The kiosk is very profitable, proving it can be done if you get the concept right. But the high degree of churn in other kiosks suggests a lot of traders don’t and quickly lose interest.Next to the pier in Brighton, Senegal-born Abo Fall is selling hats, sunglasses and beachwear out of two adjacent boxes. He has been there for two years and is keeping his head above the waves, but he says it can be a struggle if the weather’s bad. “People like the boxes and it’s different from an ordinary shop,” he says. Wherever you see a red box, you will see someone taking a picture of it, although, as the traders know all too well, that doesn’t automatically mean they will buy a coffee or a sunhat.The boxes are also useful for stunts. In 2011, residents in the Cambridgeshire village of Shepreth opened a pub (called the Dog and Bone, of course) in the local phone box to protest about the closure of their real local. The campaign seems to have paid off because that pub, the Plough, reopened in 2014. Incredibly, I can find no evidence of any plays being performed in a phonebox at the Edinburgh festival. Next year I plan to give my Hamlet in a kiosk on the Royal Mile. Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.Iniduals can also buy boxes that aren’t listed and have no prospective adopter, so are being removed. A box in poor condition will set you back almost £2,000 on eBay, or you can buy a refurbished K6 for £2,750 (plus VAT and delivery) through BT’s approved reseller X2Connect. Unicorn Restorations also supplies beautifully restored boxes – at eye-watering prices if you want a rare K2 – drawing on stock it accumulated in the 1980s and 90s when unwanted and unloved red boxes were plentiful.“We supply boxes to private buyers and commercial organisations,” says a director of X2Connect, Martin White. “They go all round the world. We’ve done shopping malls in Florida and Dubai. They’re very popular in Australia and America, but places in Europe take them as well. People put them in their gardens and companies have them in their offices. They buy them as birthday presents or just for themselves, telling us it’s something they’ve always wanted.” White says that eventually the supply will dry up, but his company has enough to keep it going for a good few years yet.The cult of the boxes is a strange and powerful one. The sculptor David Mach, who 30 years ago laid 12 of them end to end in the centre of Kingston upon Thames in a celebrated piece of public art called Out of Order, describes them as a “universal Great British thing”. “The design is fantastic,” he says, “and then it seeps wholesale into the ground and comes back up through the soles of your feet.” They have featured on a million postcards and, having been a central feature of British life for much of the 20th century, in many films. Tourists still go to the fishing village of Pennan in Aberdeenshire in search of the phone box that features prominently in the 1983 film Local Hero, not realising that the box used in the film was a wooden prop. Pennan does have a real box, with a less perfect view of the sea than in the film, so visitors make do with that.Scott’s kiosks are loved in part because they are redolent of a time when the British were willing to build a small house from which anyone could make a call. They represent civic pride and national confidence – both now in short supply. Farmer is horrified at my suggestion that we should just let them go. Objects have a use, so why keep them when they lose that use? He finds such iconoclasm detestable. “We don’t want to become like the Americans,” he says. By which I presume he means a throwaway society. But equally the veneration of the past can go too far. We surround Battersea power station with anodyne, absurdly pricey flats and tell ourselves we have rescued it, even though it has lost all its stark beauty.I wonder how Scott’s K2s and K6s will look 50 years from now, when everyone has forgotten why they were ever there and thinks they were built as micro-libraries and art galleries, coffee kiosks and collection points.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

I join the queue for cade, a spongy pancake made from chickpea flour, baked in the food truck’s wood-fired furnace, which has been a tradition in Sanary for more than 200 years.During summer weekends, owners of the town’s hundred or so pointus, brightly painted wooden fishing boats, take people for free tours of the harbour and surrounding waters. It is organised by the Association des Pointus de Sanary, all wearing marinière striped jerseys.Jean Luc Ercolani looks like a rebel. No marinière for him. He helps me into his boat and I see a tattoo of a kraken poking out from under his T-shirt sleeve. He tips his seafaring leather hat and we’re off towards the rust-coloured coastline.The walk to Portissol beach takes around 15 minutes, up the steep Montée de l’Oratoire to Notre-Dame de Pitié. The chapel was founded in 1560 and looked after by hermits who lit warning fires if there were Barbary pirates, the Duke of Savoy or a storm approaching.At the top of the hill is the Villa Baobab, home of the late scuba-ing pioneer and underwater film-maker Jacques Cousteau, who ended up in Sanary after fleeing the Nazis along with members of the German and Austrian literary scene, Thomas Mann, Joseph Roth, Klaus Mann and Stefan Zweig.I walk along the Quai Sud, a walkway at the side of the beach where there’s a seawater lagoon reserved for children practising snorkelling, and, a little further on, a ing zone where buoyant adolescents are leaping backwards into the sea. At the far end of the rocks is a cove where the smokers, dogs and inflatable beach balls hang out, none of whom are allowed on the main plage.Portissol has a thick hemline of washed-up Neptune grass between sand and sea. “It’s illegal to remove it now,” explains Axel Zoellin, who works at the beach restaurant Ô Petit Monde. The grass protects the beach. “It gets very busy here as the beach is sheltered from the wind and popular with families. We prefer to go swimming in the rocky creeks along the coast.” Axel grew up nearby, like his co-worker Luna Penn, but they actually met in Australia. Un vrai petit monde. The trendy restaurant is a cabin of modern furniture and driftwood, open every day, even during the winter, with live music on Sundays and five guestrooms upstairs. “We can seat 200 people, but out of season, it’s just locals who come,” says Zoellin.Sanary’s 21m-high stone watchtower is the emblem of the town and stood there, isolated, from the middle of the 13th century until 1507 when local inhabitants were allowed to build homes attached to its base. It stays open until 9.30pm on summer weekends, so I climb up the stone stairs and ladders to its terrace, perfect for watching the sunset.Dinner is at Hôtel de la Tour which has been run by the Mercier family since 1936. I have the fish soup and monkfish medallions but every other table has ordered the poisson en croûte de sel, a whole sea bass baked inside a mound of salt. Waiters crack open the salt crust with wooden mallets and ladle away the crystals, a theatrical excavation that serves two to three. My wife looks up from her scampi and we decide to be braver next time.Midnight, back on the portside, the night market is coming to an end and a street performer finishes with Charles Trenet’s La Mer under the harbour’s palm trees. I take the late-night trip on the Sanary Explorer, whose underwater lights pick up the moray eels phytoplankton and wake up any fish who’d already turned in for the night in the Neptune grass.• Hôtel de la Tour has doubles from €88 B\u0026ampB its restaurant serves a two-course lunchtime formule for €24.

Do you know many presidents in Africa who do better?” Alexander Bregadze asked in a new year’s broadcast on state television. “It’s constitutions that adapt to reality, not realities that adapt to constitutions.”The opposition, civil society and the Guinean press were quick to criticise the ambassador’s “populist and demagogic” meddling. “He’s campaigning, supporting the president, encouraging the diplomatic corps to support a third term. It’s anti-constitutional,” said Alpha Baldé, of the opposition Guinean Democratic Forces Union.In May, leaving his post as ambassador, Bregadze took a job at the Russian aluminium firm Rusal. He now heads up Rusal’s key unit in Guinea, home to its biggest mining interests.Russia has been trying to rekindle Soviet-era relationships with governments across the African continent and build new ties. Arms and military advisers have been supplied to countries such as the Central African Republic. Pro-Kremlin, regime-friendly “observers” have been sent to fraught elections in Zimbabwe and the DRC, producing positive takes on elections marred by rigging and violence.While it cannot compete with China’s economic might on the African continent, Russia is carving out its own role, focusing on relationships such as that with Guinea.Formerly a self-described Marxist socialist revolutionary state and the first French colony to become independent in Africa, Guinea was ideologically very important for the Soviet Union.Several activists claim Bregadze’s comments are linked to Russia’s economic interests in Guinea. That is the view of Amadou Bah, the executive director of Action Mines, a charity that monitors Guinea’s mining industry. He said Russian companies “derive enormous economic benefits for a Russian oligarchy that has considerable weight in the political and economic affairs of this country”.For some years Russia’s interests in Guinea have mostly been in mining. Guinea gets around a third of its revenues from the extractive sector.Rusal owns the Kindia Bauxite Company (CBK), which accounts for a third of Rusal’s bauxite output, as well as the Dian-Dian Bauxite Company and the Friguia complex, which mines bauxite and refines it into alumina. Nordgold, another Russian company, owns a goldmine in northern Lefa, into which it is pumping ever-greater sums.Early in Condé’s first term, Guinea adopted a new mining code that it seemed would change the way mining companies operated, requiring them to pay more tax and protect the environment and the interests of communities around their mines.It was quickly revised when companies froze billions of dollars of investments in the country, and the government showed a willingness to relax the rules for favoured partners. Companies such as Rusal whose agreements were due to expire had them extended under the old terms for another 25 years. CBK’s, for instance, was extended to 2050. According to a report by the extractive industry watchdog Publish What You Pay, it is exempt from paying taxes on land and salaries.“The Russians have a special status in Guinea. That explains the advantages given to their mining companies,” said Bah, alleging that he knew of a secret agreement between the two countries.There is a difference between the Russian government and transnational companies, said Alexandra Arkhangelskaya of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute for African Studies, and the comment made by the ambassador “probably reflects the Russian attitude and the posture on global affairs,” not Rusal’s interests.Alexis Arieff, an Africa policy analyst at the US Congressional Research Service, said the spurs for Russian interest in African countries could be drawn as a Venn diagram. “Does the country have useful mineral resources, is the country ripe for challenging the influence of key western actors, is the country a market for Russian arms?” she said. “Those seem to be key circles that when they overlap may lead to greater Russian interest. The other circle that is certainly present in Guinea is: is there a historic Russian diplomatic and military relationship?”Securing valuable votes on the UN security council and worrying western nations are two reasons for the Russian push in Africa, analysts say. Russia has succeeded in the latter: the US general responsible for military operations in Africa said in February that in CAR “elected leaders mortgage mineral rights for a fraction of their worth to secure Russian weapons”.Russia is not the only foreign power with interests in Guinea, which firmly cut ties with its former colonial master, France, after independence. China signed a $20bn infrastructure-for-minerals deal in 2017, under which three Chinese companies get bauxite concessions. The Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz’s company BSG Resources recently dropped out of a massive iron ore project after a long dispute.A Rusal spokesman said there was no conflict of interest regarding Bregadze’s appointment and no “secret strategic accords” between Rusal and Guinea. Responding to a follow-up question clarifying that the alleged secret agreement was between Guinea and Russia, the spokesman said: “The clarification does not change our response. There are no such ‘secret strategic accords’ concerning Rusal.”The Guinean foreign ministry and the Russian embassy in Conakry were approached for comment.Rusal will want to avoid a repeat of an incident in 2009 when its representative in Guinea was interrogated and berated on the then president’s bizarre late-night television show over the neglect of the company’s factory.Condé’s opponents have launched a campaign to prevent him from changing the constitution, and Russia’s backing does not carry the weight that the USSR’s did, according to Bah. “Russia has nothing to teach us in terms of democracy or the functioning of the state,” he said. “It’s up to us to run and develop our country.”Additional reporting by Fatoumata Kanté in Conakry• This article was amended on 27 September 2019 because Rusal’s Friguia complex mines bauxite and refines it into alumina, not aluminium as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f153a88aaf7448daa58f80a867b60548a5d437f3/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d6beccde0981ddb8932eb09e6ac7230","title":"three catholic schools abandon ethos to become multi faith","story":"Primary school in Roscommon and two in Kerry to reopen as multi-denominationalThree schools in Ireland will make history this week by becoming the first to abandon their Catholic ethos and become multi-denominational state-run schools.The three small primary schools – Lecarrow in County Roscommon, and Tahilla national school and Scoil an Ghleanna, both in County Kerry – will reopen for the new term on Thursday under the umbrella of local education and training boards.They will offer a multi-belief and values programme rather than Catholic instruction. Preparation for the sacraments of communion and confirmation will take place outside school hours.The schools hope to retain and draw pupils from Ireland’s growing number of atheists, agnostics and non-Catholics. Lecarrow and Tahilla national school have just eight pupils each. Scoil an Ghleanna has 14.“We had a third of our pupils who were non-religious, so we had to look at this,” Sorcha Ni Chatháin, the principal of Scoil an Ghleanna, told RTÉ News. “We needed to look at how we were going to keep pupils, and entice others. We are a beautiful school in the most stunning location, and now we can show – formally, on paper – that we are all inclusive.”Teachers, parents andCatholic clerics endorsed the transition as essential for survival. “This is what the community wanted and I was happy to facilitate that process,” said Fr Patsy Lynch,the parish priest.Under the education and training board structures, the schools will gain more state help for staffing, IT and building maintenance.The Catholic church has previously transferred unused school buildings to multi-denominational patronage but this is said to be the first “live” transfer.The initiative by the three schools reflects a desire to stem decline in rural areas, where closed schools are a common sight. The closure of post offices, banks, police stations and pubs in villages and small towns has prompted warnings of a crisis in rural Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3998783.1566909188!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"broadband plan fg committee members say review of 3bn project a waste of time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe chair of the Oireachtas Communications Committee Hildegarde Naughten, said it was ‘critical’ the Government proceed and sign the contract.It would be a “waste of time” to independently review the €3 billion national broadband plan, Fine Gael members of the Oireachtas Communications Committee have said.The committee has published a report into the plan which has recommended a three-month independent review. It also recommended that the network remain in public ownership.Fine Gael members of the committee, including the chair Hildegarde Naughten, voted against those recommendations.At the launch, Fine Gael senator Joe O’Reilly said he did not believe anything new would be gleaned through an independent review and said he did not think the €3 billion figure could be reduced.He also said it was too late to look into the issue of public ownership and it would be a “waste of time” to further delay the report.Ms Naughten said it was “critical” that the Government proceed and sign the contract.“We can not afford not to do it.” “Broadband will allow people to be able to work from home. We need this for Ireland, for rural Ireland and urban Ireland. This has been assessed at every critical junction.“I don’t believe we will have new information in three months.”Asked whether Fianna Fáil would pull support over the broadband contract, he said: “we are going to see out Brexit and there is a budget, but after that we are into new territory, we are into a new arena.”As previously reported by The , the committee calls for the network to be kept in public ownership.“The committee notes that, notwithstanding timeline complications, the broadband network infrastructure should be under the ownership of the State as it is strategically important to the State. “There is no justification for the resulting network to be owned by the minority investor instead of the majority investor, which is the State,” notes the report.The document also calls for the plan to be further revised so that the full cost of providing a connection for every new house to the broadband network is provided for in the planning conditions for the construction of a new house.More to follow.

Photograph: Isabel InfantesAFPGetty ImagesUK opposition parties agreed on Tuesday to move as early as next week to block a no-deal Brexit and prioritise using legislation to try to block prime minister Boris Johnson from leaving the EU without a deal at the end of October.After a two-hour meeting, MPs from various parties, including Labour, agreed the joint approach – leaving the alternative proposal for a vote of no confidence as a fallback “nuclear option”.The agreement means that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has – for now – in effect abandoned hopes of toppling Mr Johnson and succeeding him as a caretaker prime minister.The Scottish National Party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Party and the Independent Group for Change joined with Labour and vowed to stop a “disastrous no-deal exit”.According to one participant at the opposition parties’ meeting, held in Mr Corbyn’s parliamentary office, those involved could try to engineer a vote in the House of Commons as early as next week. “Speed is of the essence,” he said.Separately, 160 anti-Brexit MPs on Tuesday signed the Church House Declaration – named after the building where they met – vowing to hold an alternative parliament if Mr Johnson suspends the House of Commons to force through a no-deal Brexit.In a statement, Labour insisted that the various opposition parties were still open to either a vote of no confidence or passing legislation. But other opposition MPs made clear that they preferred to use the legislative route.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said that a vote of no confidence would be “risky”. “It could enable Boris Johnson himself to seize the moment and try to hold an election that would happen after October 31st so we could be crashing out of the EU during an election campaign,” she said.TacticsAdam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru, said the parties had agreed that a vote of no confidence was one of several issues that could be “parked ... for another day”.Other opposition figures argued that no Tory MPs would agree to hold a vote of no confidence. They fear that it could lead to a “hard left” Labour government and Mr Corbyn in Downing Street – even in a caretaker capacity ahead of an early election.The opposition MPs said they would work together to prevent Mr Johnson from suspending parliament through “prorogation” and also to try to force the House of Commons to sit during the party conference season. They agreed to set up a new contact group to work together on tactics in the coming days.The main figures working to block a no-deal Brexit include several Europhile former Conservative ministers, such as Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve. They have been joined in recent weeks by former ministers from the Theresa May administration, including former chancellor Philip Hammond. However no Tory MPs attended Tuesday’s meeting, with several citing diary commitments for their absence.By contrast there were several senior figures from the Labour Party, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell, chief whip Nick Brown, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz. Opponents of a no-deal Brexit have drawn up drafts of a bill that, if passed, would force the prime minister to extend Article 50, delaying Brexit.They then have one of two options on how to push the legislation through the Commons. The first is by using a “Standing Order 24” to organise an emergency debate. The second is by trying to amend a government report due in September about efforts to restore Northern Ireland’s devolved administration at Stormont, to express MPs’ opposition to a hard Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Sir Keir, speaking earlier on the BBC’s Today programme, admitted there would have to be “give and take” if pro-EU Tory rebels were to vote in the same ision lobbies as Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats and other smaller parties to halt a no-deal Brexit.“We have got one week to make sure as far as possible we have a plan that is effective and we can put into action,” he said. Sir Keir added that passing a law to prevent a no-deal exit could be “direct and effective”.‘Perverse’Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson agreed that the “strongest option” would be to pass a law requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension of the Article 50 exit process – allowing time for a second EU referendum or election. But she said any plan would have to be legally watertight so that it did not “come apart at the last minute”.Senior officials in the Johnson government described Mr Corbyn’s decision to work with other MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit as “utterly perverse”.“We are now making progress because our European partners realise we are serious about leaving the EU on October 31st, no ifs, no buts,” a No 10 aide said.“It’s utterly perverse that Corbyn and his allies are actively seeking to sabotage the UK’s position. This coalition of anti-democrats should be honest with the British public: they are against us leaving the EU no matter what. The government believes politicians don’t get to choose which public votes they respect.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

House sales jumped 6.1 per cent over the month to 10 August compared with a year ago. Rightmove attributed the unexpected increase to the looming Brexit deadline and lower house prices.\u0026nbsp“There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial, financial and emotional forces driving the need to move,” said Miles Shipside, housing market analyst at the company.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Performers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Growth in net credit card spending slowed for the third consecutive month. The net amount – which is the\u0026nbspdifference between spending and repayments, adjusted for factors\u0026nbspsuch as\u0026nbsppopulation changes and write-offs –\u0026nbsprose by £49m, the weakest increase this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the spokesman said. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Performers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

They include media companies Bloomberg and Discovery, and financial firms MarketAxess and Norinchukin.\u0026nbspOther businesses attracted to the Netherlands because of Brexit are in the IT, advertising, and life sciences and health sectors.\u0026nbspThe interest in the country is likely to grow further in coming months, according to the agency.“Our experience shows that when a Brexit deal gets further out of sight, and the chance of a no deal increases, more companies contact us,” said Mr Nijland.Other countries that firms affected by Brexit are considering include France, Ireland, Germany and Belgium, he added.\u0026nbspDespite the greater interest from foreign companies, overall Britain’s departure from the EU “is not good news” for the Netherlands, the spokesman for the agency said.\u0026nbsp“The UK is our second-largest trading partner in Europe, and 200,000 jobs in the Netherlands are related to the economic relationship with the UK,” he noted.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And I’d enjoyed it.\u0026nbspI couldn’t tell you the last time that happened.\u0026nbspThis led me to ask a question: with the British town centre in crisis –\u0026nbspthe number of vacant premises at its\u0026nbsphighest level for more than four years –\u0026nbspis there anything we could learn from the place?Labour promises free wifi in town centres and scrapping ATM chargesHigh streets propose five-year plan for digital technology sales boostYou have to be a little bit careful at the outset. We’re talking here about a picturesque and historic walled town in the middle of a region that attracts a large number of visitors.You’re not going to be able to replicate what it has across Britain. \u0026nbspBut here’s the thing: similarly\u0026nbsptouristy places\u0026nbspon this side of the channel are struggling in a way that Dinan at least doesn’t appear to be.Nationally, the British Retail Consortium puts the vacancy rate at 10.3 per cent. Footfall declined by 1.9 per cent in July.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just economically deprived areas that are struggling either. Last year it was reported that there were 42 vacant premises in the picturesque city of Bath, for example. It’s a good deal bigger than Dinan, but is a similar tourist trap thanks to the world-famous Roman baths, which have given the city the status of a Unesco\u0026nbspworld heritage site and put it high on the itinerary of visitors to the region.\u0026nbspCampaigner Luke John Emmett successfully drew attention to the city centre’s plight with the aid of a camera. He says while landlords have made efforts to make some of the empty premises look less unsightly since then, and new tenants are promised, the problem continues.\u0026nbspAs retailers continue to close stores, the issue of empty shopfronts looks set to continue to plague the British high street.\u0026nbspSo to Dinan. What made mooching around the place such a pleasure was the sheer variety of what this small town had to offer.\u0026nbspOf course we saw places catering for the tourist euro, but there were also bookshops, a toyshop, bakeries, a place where a bloke was selling lights built out of scrap, an indoor market.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not that they aren’t there. There was, of course, a Carrefour convenience outlet, broadly equivalent to Tesco . There was also a bookie, in the form of a PMU bar. But they weren’t dominant features in\u0026nbspthe same way that they are in Britain.\u0026nbspThe retreat of the chains could provide an opportunity for small and more specialist outlets to move in, especially in places like Bath which have a ready supply of visitors.But, of course, there are high rents to contend with and the running sore of business rates linked to property values that are far\u0026nbsphigher in town centres than they are on the outskirts where internet retailers like Amazon build their warehouses.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Would you risk setting up a shop in the current climate when you’d be better off selling online from your garage if retail is your thing?Some imagination is called for, and from local as well as central government. Mr\u0026nbspEmmett thinks encouraging pop-up shops could help. That’s an idea that could have legs. A fresh\u0026nbspset of shops every week? People might just be moved to take a trip to check out the week’s new arrivals if there were to be a variety of places cycling through.\u0026nbspWhat Britain’s walking dead town centres are in dire need of is what Dinan obviously has in abundance: life. It would certainly help if the nation could find a government willing and able to breathe it in.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That is the highest number since February 2017.\u0026nbsp“It is possible that mortgage activity is being lifted by some people looking to complete their house purchases before Brexit occurs on 31 October, given the major uncertainties surrounding the UK successfully leaving the EU with a deal,” commented Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.Data from Rightmove released last week supports this interpretation. House sales jumped 6.1 per cent over the month to 10 August compared with a year ago. Rightmove attributed the unexpected increase to the looming Brexit deadline and lower house prices.\u0026nbsp“There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial, financial and emotional forces driving the need to move,” said Miles Shipside, housing market analyst at the company.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Performers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the spokesman said. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Performers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening.

The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.He added: “And we are learning, as time goes on, to try to get through that. Thankfully, women are really helping. So it feels like men have been the beneficiaries of the patriarchy, but I don’t know if it’s necessarily the case.“Modern men mostly feel a lot of guilt for the fact that we’re men, even if, most of the time, I feel I haven’t done anything wrong. But I’m a man. White, middle-class — so I must’ve done something wrong? Being part of the patriarchy is a double-edged sword.”O\u0027Dowd\u0026nbspwill star\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspState of the Union alongside Rosamund Pike.

NatWest had been hit by 25 different outages 12-months to the end of June, it said.Both banks\u0027 websites are completely broken, meaning that even navigating to the homepage will not work. As well as stopping people from being able to login through the website, it means that all information stored on those pages is unavailable.“We are aware that customers are currently experiencing issues accessing our websites and online banking login pages, an RBS spokesperson said.\u0026nbspWe apologise for the inconvenience caused.We are aware of the problem and are working hard to fix it. Customers can still access Online Banking via direct links, they can use their mobile app, ATMs, telephone banking, or visit their local branch.”New NatWest bank cards allow people to pay with fingerprintThe banks did however suggest that their apps are still working as normal, and that customers with pressing issues could message the bank through that for more help.They did say however that the problems mean that there may be a delay in hearing back.Customer support wait times may be longer than usual, NatWest warned on Twitter.

On Monday, Wells Fargo published a research note that said a deal could make sense now, in part because Altria has a stake in the vaping company Juul.Philip Morris had a market value of nearly $121 billion at the close of trading in New York on Monday, while Altria was worth about $88 billion.Tobacco giant launches life insurance firm with discount to ex-smokersTobacco giant accused of \u0027staggering hypocrisy\u0027 over stop smoking adsPhilip Morris boss Peter Nixon on taking the smoke out of smokingPhilip Morris wants to stop selling cigarettes, says ad campaignA reunification would combine two of the most popular smoking alternative products: IQOS and Juul. Philip Morris has been ploughing billions of dollars in promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions consumers outside the US. Altria meanwhile has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., which has catapulted itself to the US industry leader in smoking alternatives in just a few years.Altria also has been planning to start selling IQOS in the U.S. this year, testing out demand in the Atlanta area with a store opening next month.Philip Morris said in a statement that no agreement has been formally reached and any deal would be subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star\u0027s mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star\u0027s core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

At the time it was believed to be the ninth planet from the Sun, existing on the outer edges of the solar system in the Kuiper belt.Its status as a planet was called into question 62 years later after other similarly-sized objects were discovered in the same region of space.Created with Sketch.The most incredible space images of Earth Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake\u0027s stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalIn 2005, astronomers discovered a dwarf planet called Eris that was 27 per cent larger than Pluto. A year later, the International Astronomical Union laid out its official definition for what constituted a planet. Pluto was not included.Since then it has been classified as a dwarf planet, though the icy object has attracted a dedicated following of people who claim Pluto should be considered a planet.In 2015 Nasa’s New Horizons mission to Pluto made several major discoveries that added fuel to the debate.Alan Stern, the Nasa scientist who led the New Horizons mission, subsequently co-authored a paper calling for Pluto to be reclassified.\u0026nbspThe Society for the Preservation of Pluto as a Planet has campaigned for Pluto’s status to be upgraded.“For over 75 years school children all over the world have learned that our solar system has nine planets,” the group’s website states.“Pluto’s status as a planet has sparked the human imagination for decades... Now is not the time to downgrade Pluto’s status.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With them sit a pair of slippers\u0026nbspand a straw hat – items to prepare the 85-year-old Zimbabwean native\u0026nbspfor the unpredictable British weather. Little did she know that a month later they would be gathering dust.The 60-year-old care home worker, who moved to Britain in 1999, had been looking forward to her father’s visit for months. Paul Tipa, an agriculture worker, has never left landlocked Zimbabwe, so it would be a chance to not only show him around London, but to take him to the seaside for the first time. Plus, he would be able to meet his\u0026nbspthree-year-old,\u0026nbspBritish-born\u0026nbspgreat granddaughter, Ariella.Tipa, 85, had been looking forward to visiting his daughter Celia in the UK for the first timeCeclia\u0026nbspsays she had ‘everything lined up’ for her father’s visit, including clothing, slippers and toiletries“I feel it’s so unfair. I felt part of the country, part of the culture. But this really proved to me that I don’t belong. I feel like an outsider,” says Cecilia.\u0026nbsp”I have worked so hard, contributed. I am law abiding. I just want him to come this one time. Now I’m going to work and I’m thinking, why am I doing this?“He is my father. He is the one who gave me the opportunity to be doing what I’m doing here. So he should have the right to visit me. He has no reason to overstay, especially in the cold here. He doesn’t like to be cold.Ariella\u0026nbsp(left), for the first time”Caring for elderly patients every day, other elderly fathers, and I am denied the right to see my own.”Cecilia is one of many African nationals who have lived and worked in the UK for decades, yet have been denied the right to have their elderly relatives visit them on the grounds that their family members do not have sufficient income in their home country.African people twice as likely to be refused UK visas, finds reportLawyers say\u0026nbspthese refusals amount to a “misapplication” of the immigration rules and are\u0026nbsppotentially unlawful, as the applicant’s own financial circumstances should be “entirely irrelevant” if a third party – such as their offspring in the UK – has proven they can fund their visit. They also argue that citing their income and background in this way is a form of racism.It comes amid existing concern about\u0026nbspracial bias in the visa system, after a report last month found that African people were more than twice as likely to be refused a UK visa as applicants from other parts of the world.In another case, Zimbabwean national Spiwe Jaji, 49, who was granted refugee status after coming to the UK in 2002, and has since worked as a healthcare assistant and now a nurse, says she feels\u0026nbsp“betrayed” by the UK after the Home Office refused her mother’s visit visa for a similar reason.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since her father past away three years ago, she has longed for her mother, 74-year-old Rettia Jaji, a farmer, to spend some time with her in England. \u0026nbsp“When I do go home I’m just rushing around seeing relatives. I don’t have time to stay with my mum properly. When my dad passed away I didn’t even have time to get closure,” says Spiwe.“My mum wouldn’t even want to stay for the full six months of the visa, let alone stay longer than that. She has got livestock. She has been in that village or more than 50 years. How can she abandon it? She goes to see her husband’s grave every day.passsed away three years ago, she has longed for her mother, 74-year-old Rettia Jaji, a farmer, to spend some time with her in England (Spiwe Jaji)“I look after older people in this country with compassion and love. I see old ladies like my mum every day and take good care of them. But they won’t allow me to have my mum come and just stay with me for even just one or two months.“It feels like they are racially discriminating against Africans. I don’t think they are even assessing our applications, just denying them.”In a third case, London-based Nigerian national Elizabeth Ezeronye, who has been living and working in the UK for more than a decade and has British citizenship, says she feels\u0026nbsp“let down” by the UK government after her 64-year-old mother, Regina Chukwu, was denied a visit visa.Ezeronye and her husband Okezie, who both work with vulnerable people, were disappointed when the Home Office rejected Regina’s visa application to see her grandson for the first timeThe 34 year old, who works as a team leader in a care home, and whose husband Okezie is a support worker for vulnerable adults, says she wanted her mother to meet her eight-month-old baby, Charles, for the first time and help her to care for the child during the remainder of her maternity leave.Describing the moment she saw the refusal letter, she says: “I cried. We had provided a letter saying we have a two-bedroom flat and that she was going to stay with us. All the bank statements, pay slips, to prove it. It feels like they didn’t look at any of those documents.“I work with vulnerable people, and the one thing we ask for, for my mum to visit, on all our expenses. Is it because she’s an African? Because she’s Nigerian? I don’t know. It feels racist and unjust.“I treat vulnerable people everyday. It is my passion. I give back to the system. I have been loyal to the country, a law-abiding citizen,\u0026nbspBut when I ask them for one thing, for my mum to come visit, it is refused.”Elizabeth says she wishes\u0026nbspto challenge the decision, but that she couldn’t afford to pay a solicitor, adding: “Now that I’ve got my bundle of joy, they treat me this way.”Human rights barrister Jan Doerfel said\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspsuch cases are “not uncommon”, and accused\u0026nbspthe Home Office “systematically misapplying the rules and rendering them more restrictive”, which\u0026nbsphe said in turn undermined\u0026nbspthe rule of law\u0026nbspand constituted\u0026nbspracism.Mother blocked from attending daughter’s graduation“When there is a reason for a visit and there are finances available, then a visa should be granted. But they’re saying you are too poor to intend to return. And that is racism,” he says. “It directly discriminates on the basis of income, and it indirectly discriminates on the basis of country or origin, which amounts to racism.“Income should be irrelevant when you’ve got someone paying for your trip. It’s not in the immigration rules that if you earn less than ‘X’ you can be refused.“It stems out of the hostile environment. We used to call it a \u0027culture of disbelief\u0027, but I think it’s a refusal culture, because it’s not that they don’t believe it.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “All cases are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available, in line with the immigration rules.“We are clear that applicants must be able to maintain and accommodate themselves during their visit without working, and prove that they have a genuine intention to leave the UK.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Earlier this month, for instance,\u0026nbspUS Federal Aviation Administration said the computers would be banned from flights in the US.The FAA is aware of the recalled batteries that are used in some AppleMacBook Pro laptops, the agency\u0027s spokesman said in an emailed statement on Monday, adding that the agency has alerted airlines about the recall.Some MacBooks banned from flightsBut the Virgin Australia ban goes further, affecting every single one of Apple\u0027s laptops, not only the 15-inch versions.Due to a worldwide recall by Apple of a number of Apple MacBook batteries, ALL Apple MacBooks must be placed in carry-on baggage only, a note on its website reads.\u0026nbspNo Apple MacBooks are permitted in checked in baggage until further notice.Apple\u0027s has launched a recall program for those with the affected laptops, as well as a special website that can be used to find out whether a computer is one of the limited number of devices that are affected by the concerns.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think you’ve set a new standard.”The conservative writer then proceeded to invite Karpf to his home to meet his wife and children and call him a “‘bedbug’ to my face”.“That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part,” he continued. “I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say.”\u0026nbspStephens concluded the email informing Karpf his invitation was a standing one and that he was “more than welcome” to bring his significant other.The exchange went viral after Karpf shared it on Twitter, prompting the creation of trending hashtags including #BretBug and #BedbugBret.\u0026nbspBut, according to Karpf, he stands by his joke and believes that Stephen’s response was an “abuse of his power”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologise for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt.

They\u0026nbspwere initially given a Tuesday deadline, but on Monday the president extended that by 24 hours.Mr Conte, who remains in place as caretaker prime minister, returned to Rome from the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, for talks with 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio and Democrat chief Nicola Zingaretti on Monday evening.

He is now Italy’s most popular politician, according to opinion polls.His reinstatement, demanded by the anti-establishment 5-Star but previously resisted by the centre-left Democrats, had been the main obstacle to a deal between the two traditionally antagonistic parties.Mr Zingaretti had insisted any new government should break with the past. He evaded questions on whether he had relaxed that stance on Monday, but Mr Conte’s participation in the talks signalled he was set to head up the new coalition.“We are working to give Italy a new government,” Mr Zingaretti told reporters after a meeting earlier in the day with Mr Di Maio. “I think we are on the right track.

On this occasion, such a move could potentially scupper the whole deal, throwing Italy back into political chaos.5-Star’s leadership has been ided between factions that favour a coalition with the Democrats and those who believe it would shatter the party’s anti-establishment image and accelerate a decline in voter support it has suffered over the last year.Mr Mattarella has warned he will dissolve parliament, triggering new elections this autumn, if he does not receive guarantees a new coalition would give the country a lasting government.Italian centre-left demands repeal of far-right’s anti-migrant lawsDoes Italy’s coalition collapose spell political suicide for Salvini?Salvini calls for elections as Italy’s coalition government fracturesMr Zingaretti promised such a government was his goal. He said: “We need to put together a budget which requires a new, serious and authoritative government.“Assembling a government is a serious thing, we’re serious people. We don’t want to form another one like the last one that collapsed after 14 months.”Mr Salvini, who last week had floated the idea of cobbling together a new coalition with his fellow deputy prime minister,\u0026nbspMr Di Maio, sounded resigned on Monday night that his scheming to win new elections was about to be thwarted.“It seems like a government is being born with power being the only glue,” the League leader told reporters after a calling a press conference\u0026nbspin which he\u0026nbspclaimed the proposed new coalition would be a “betrayal of the popular will”.“You can run away from elections for a month or two months or a year, but you can’t run away for ever,” he added. “Those who are afraid of the judgment of the Italians don’t have a clear conscience.”Conte, flanked by Matteo Salvini, left, and Luigi Di Maio, delivers a speech in the Italian Senate last week (AFPGetty Images)The new government would be required to win mandatory confidence votes in each of parliament’s two chambers.Mr Mattarella’s office said the president would hold a second round of talks with party leaders, starting with the smallest parties in parliament on Tuesday evening.He has set aside Wednesday for longer closed-door sessions with the heads of the Democrats, the League, and 5-Star.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But what is HS, how much will it cost, and whats its planned routel The high speed rail line will increase capacity on Britains railways - slashing journey times and giving passengers a place to sit with thousands of extra seats every day.The £billion project has been branded a game changer by ministers because many services are currently full to overflowing.Plans were passed by parliament in February , and work on the first phase, from London to Birmingham, is due to begin in late .A second route has also been proposed through Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds.Once the project is completed, the number of passengers between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds per hour could treble to ,.There should also be  commuter and intercity trains an hour between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds – a  per cent rise from the current .The system will be designed to carry trains capable of travelling at mph.The budget for the new rail network is currently £bn over its duration.But in July, Allan Cook, the chairman of HS Ltd, the company delivering the project, reportedly told the Department for Transport that HS could not be completed within its current budget.He added that the current cost could rise by £bn.The Department for Transport said in response: The chairman of HS Ltd is conducting detailed work into of the costs and schedule of the project to ensure it delivers benefits to passengers, the economy and represents value for money for the taxpayer.A HS spokesperson said: We dont comment on leaks or speculation.We are determined to deliver a railway that rebalances the economy, creates jobs, boosts economic growth and is value for money for taxpayers.The BBC reported it has seen a May  letter written by then-transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin to George Osborne - chancellor at the time - stating that the first phase of HS was £ billion over budget.Phase  of the railway between London and Birmingham was initially due to cost £ billion.The BBC reported it also obtained a December  DfT briefing note labelled confidential which states that a signicant gap to target price will remain for HS even with planned savings.The first phase is due to open in December  and will see trains travel at high speed between London and Birmingham - cutting through areas of Buckinghamshire and the Midlands.The trains will then run from Birmingham on the existing West Coast Main Line.Phase  is Y-shaped, and from Birmingham takes the high speed line to the north east and north west of England.The route to Leeds and York will run east of Sheffield.The western route will see trains pass from Crewe to Manchester.Passengers travelling on the East Coast and West Coast main lines will benefit from more services and extra seats once the HS high-speed rail project is completed.The first part of the project between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of , while the second part to Manchester and Leeds is expected to be completed by -.Speaking while running for the position of Conservative Party leader, Boris Johnson said he would not scrap the plans, but did express anxieties about the business case.Transport Secretary Grants Shapps has now launched a review of the project, saying that a go or no-go decision would be made by the end of the year.He said it was responsible to see whether the benefits really stack up.The review will look into the cost estimates and the economic case for the project, opportunities for efficiency savings, and the environmental impact, focusing specically on the governments commitment to making the UK a net-zero carbon emitter by .Labour peer Lord Adonis, a former transport secretary who worked as an infrastructure adviser to Theresa May, said the review screws Birmingham  the North and would become a massive bun fight, while the transport department runs for cover and HS Ltd is paralysed by indecision.HS cleared its final hurdle when it was given Royal Assent in February, paving the way for work on the first phase of the line to begin.The Government has announced troubled construction giant Carillion is among the firms awarded contracts for the building of phase one of the HS rail line.UK firms Costain and Balfour Beatty will also build tunnels, bridges and embankments.The line has been branded a white elephant that will tear through the British countryside, with some homeowners facing their property being flattened to make way.New housing estates face being torn down to make way for the high speed rail and an investigation by the Mail on Sunday claimed £million has been spent buying homes no longer affected due to changes to the HS route, leaving it with houses it doesnt need.House owners whose homes have to be demolished will be offered comparable properties, the Department for Transport has stated.Campaign group Stop HS has worked tirelessly to oppose the rail line, and says the government is ignoring its own advice on harming the environment.A senior Cabinet source told Channel s Dispatches programme in February  that another option is currently under review to only build Phase One of the HS - which will run from London to Birmingham.Ministers were also reportedly considering axing the whole project amid concerns the spending will soar by  per cent over the next decade.The Government’s former chief in-house rail advisor Professor Stephen Glaister told Dispatches that HS was not thought through.He said: “There was no big picture analysis.You might ask the question what  could you do You could give larger sums of money to Manchester to Birmingham, to Newcastle and let them do as they saw best for their local communities.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A disaster. A “catastrophic ­national danger”, according to the feverish .They say Britain is on a “clf edge”. If we leave without a deal it will be a “car crash”.It will bring the “hardship of war” raining down upon us, says one Brexitphobic columnist. These people seem to live in a permanent state of dread.They’re forever fantasising about a desolate post-Brexit world in which there will be “riots, looting and disorder”as zombied Brits fight each other for scraps of food and bottles of medicine.The rest of us, however, have a rather dferent take on No Deal. Across the country, far from the political bubbles and ivory towers inhabited by these anti-Brexit hysterics, people are far more chilled out about the prospect of No Deal.You hear it in everyday ­conversations: “If the EU won’t give us a good deal, let’s leave without one.”You see it on Question Time when the audience applauds a list who says we should walk away from the EUit keeps messing us about. And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet. It’s a far happier place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with their partners snoring robbing them of any shut-eye.Dr Sarah Jarvis told The Sun Online that there are lots of reasons for shoring, but warned it can be a sign of the serious condition of sleep apnoea.In people with OSA, the airways collapse down when your muscles relax as you sleep, blocking off your air supply, she explained.People with OSA are almost always snorers.They often stop breathing for  seconds or more at a time.The lack of oxygen causes them to jerk partly awake, and this can be repeated dozens or even hundreds of time a night.This leads to tiredness the next day because sleep is so disturbed, but also of course the same long-term health risks of heart disease.While sleep apnoea is a serious cause of snoring, in many cases it is just plain annoying.Mike Dilkes, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at Londons Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, told Thethat while its not a habit you may choose to have, its one you can choose to stop.Around  per cent of men over  snore, while around one in three women are guilty too.Mr Dilkes shared his revolutionary tongue and throat work out, designed to tone up the bits in your neck that can cause snoring.Its split into three sets of three exercises:Other ways to combat snoring include losing weight, stopping boozing and getting fitter.Alternatively,you need a quicker fix then investing in a £ plant from ASDA may help as earlier this year it was revealed that it could stop you snoring.Pineapple plants are said to reduce snoring thanks to their night-time oxygen production.In fact, according to NASA studies, pineapple plants also improve air quality throughout the night and therefore aid better and quieter sleep.And this chuffed we claimed a £ pillow stopped her husbands snoring thanks to its internal foam core which moulds to the body and helps improve breathing and alignment."},{"url":null,"title":"big cat yorkshire dog photograher","story":"John Pearson, , was taking pictures at St Aidans Nature Reserve near Leeds when the mysterious creature caught his eye.He said: Im an amateur photographer so I just go out taking photos, I have done for a while.When I saw it, I didnt think it was a cat -

A jury from a previous trial had been unable to reach a verdict.Earlier this year, the Crown told the court Al Bayati’s consistent denial of any wrongdoing should be focused on.Police gave Al Bayati multiple opportunities to explain why he was in the stairwell with the child but never gave a straight answer, claiming he was helping her look for her mum.In a victim impact statement read to the court earlier this month, the three-year-old’s mother spoke of the devastating impact the ordeal had had on her child.The mum said their peaceful family le had been “destroyed” by Al Bayati’s behaviour and their daughter was still having nightmares almost three years after it.“This tragedy squeezed le, positive outlook, trust and happiness out of us in a way that is hard to describe,” she said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To extend Article  and get rid of the October  deadline.It was a very constructive meeting.And Jo Swinson, who has said she doesnt want to waste time on Mr Corbyns plot to become PM, said his idea was thrown out too.There was real focus and real agreement on the table about the best forward to pursue legislative approaches.More meetings will take place in the next  hours to work out exactly how to do it, she revealed.Party leaders agreed to set up a working group and have more meetings in the coming days to thrash out their plan to take control of the Commons - which was successful earlier this year by Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Letwin.Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said the meeting had a very positive spirit.She told the Mirror: What we agreed upon is we will work upon a legislative approach and that we will be implementing that as soon as we can [next week].SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the parties had committed to work together effectively to prevent a catastrophic No Deal.He added: Parliament must grasp this opportunity, unite to stop Boris Johnson shutting down democracy - and be ready to use all mechanisms to block a no-deal disaster, including deploying legislation as a priority.Tory rebels including Dominic Grieve and Sir Oliver were invited but didnt attend today.Independent MP Nick Boles, who didnt go, said that MPs must now stop the conference recess in just a few weeks time.He said: Voters will not understand Parliament knocking off for  weeks at this crucial time.Meanwhile, MPs from across the political spectrum gathered for a symbolic meeting at Church House in Westminster this afternoon.They signed a declaration opposing any plans to shut down Parliament, and vow to set up their own one insteadthat happens, as ITV revealed last night.John McDonnell attended on behalf of Labour.And this afternoon another group of MPs wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, asking him to chair a so-called citizens assembly made up of the public to try and find a way to break the Breixt deadlock.Senior MPs including Hilary Ben, Yvette Cooper, Frank Field and Caroline Spelman said it would give people the chance to listen, debate and come up with their own plans to sort it out.A process which involves a bit less shouting and a bit more listening and considering could help the whole country, they said.The Archbishop welcomed the invitation and said he was honoured to be approached.But he would only do itit had cross party support, wouldnt delay Brexit, and was properly organised.Let us pray for all those in government, parliament and political leadership, he said today.Let us pray for the people of this country whose lives will be affected in many ways by the momentous decisions that are made.He said he still thought an early election and then an extension of Article  was the simplest and most democratic way of doing that.But he didnt mention a no confidence vote in Boris, something Tories think he will probably losehe brings it forwards next week.However, he didnt mention a plan to create a new law to stop No Deal either, as was agreed this morning with opposition MPs.I would like to invite you to join a dialogue with myself, as leader of the Labour Party, and other opposition parties, to find a way for the clear will of parliament against No Deal to express itself, he wrote.Jeremy Corbyn outlined the legal advice he has received from Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti which calls Boris Johnson’s plans to suspend parliament to force through a No Deal the gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK Constitutional principle in living memory.The opposition leaders agreed that Boris Johnson has shown himself open to using anti-democratic means to force through no deal for which he has no mandate.The opposition leaders agreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent No Deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence.The party leaders agreed to further meetings.Tory MP Mr Grieve, who was invited to todays summit but didnt attend, said this afternoon that it was the First big step in building unity against No Deal.And he claimed: Patriotism requires us to put our country’s needs ahead of any sectional, factional or party interest and those who have agreed to do this are indeed true patriots.Mr Grieve said that Mr Corbyn as a caretaker PM wouldnt work.But he floated the idea that Hilary Benn, a long-standing Labour MP, could instead be an interim leader - and again said he wanted another referendum to stop Brexit.He also said it would be easierRemainer MPs changed the Brexit date or even eliminated it entirely - opening the door for revoking Article  and stopping our EU exit in its tracks.It needs a high level of trust involved - Jeremy Corbyn is something of an outsider even in his own political party.Labours Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Radio  earlier: I think its important we pull people together and agree a plan.But what we did back in April was to ensure that the majority in Parliament was able to take control of proceedings and pass legislation to extend Article .And he admitted that he would fight for Labour to Remain in the EU in any outcome - alongside John McDonnell and Diane Abbott.Tory Chairman James Cleverly said: It’s becoming increasingly clear Labour want to ignore the referendum, stay in the EU and will use any excuse to do so.Labour’s repeated promises to respect the referendum result lie in tatters and it’s clear Corbyn cannot be trusted to deliver on the will of the British people.Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will deliver Brexit by  October, whatever the circumstances, and deliver the change British people voted to see.Meanwhile, Boris is set to send his Brexit chief to Brussels on Wednesday for urgent talks about breaking the Brexit deadlock.David Frost will go over tomorrow to seethere is any chance a deal can be done.Boris launched a pre-emptive strike against the Corbyn-led talks, accusing him of plotting to “renege, reject, revoke the mandate of the people”.The PM added: “And I cannot think of anything worse for democracy or for trust in politics and I very much hope that does not happen.”And Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen blasted: “Corbyn is trying to rally his coalition of chaos to make his dreams of an October revolution a reality and get himself into No without ever winning an election in true Marxist style.He leads a Labour Party where two thirds of their seats voted Leave and the policy is now to stop Brexit at all cost, with the help of the SNP, who love referendums but hate the results.The Lib Dems who propose a policy of a second referendum but who would only accept a remain result and a rag tag rabble of democracy deniers, defectors and by-election dodgers.Hes been having discussions with his EU parts for weeks already, but after Boris breakthrough last week there is hope that a deal can be reached.Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron gave Boris  days to come up with a solution to the hated backstop, and have indicated they are willing to talk."},{"url":null,"title":"boris says remainer mps cant stop a no deal brexit","story":"The PM has vowed to take Britain out of the EU “do or die” by October  -

devised by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Sir Oliver Letwin.However, this process is not a quick one and repeating it in the short time remaining before the Brexit deadline will be tricky.Another option would be to launch an emergency debate to push through legislation to block No Deal.This move can be given the green-light by Commons Speaker and rabid Remainer, John Bercow.Today Remainer MPs including Mr Corbyn decided this would be the most effective option to try and stop a No Deal.Boris and his team have repeatedly said it is not up to MPs to decide which votes they respect and that the will of the people must be upheld.But a group of Remainer campaigners are set to take the government to court next month.The group of more than  MPs and campaigners were given a boost when a top judge agreed to give their case a full hearing on September .They took their case to the Court of Sessions in Edinburgh to stop Boris Johnson from proroguing parliament to force through a No-Deal Brexit.However, Boris could find another way around this which wouldnt involve shutting down Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"jay aston bucks fizz eurovision","story":"NewsJay Aston: Bucks Fizz Eurovision winner stands for Nigel Farages Brexit PartyThe Bucks Fizz star is standing in Remain-backing Kensington after undergoing a gruelling diagnosis of mouth cancerShareCommentsByLeyla MohammedOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsJay Aston was unveiled as the partys candidate \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

But they say the trip got worse as it went on as they were exposed to a dirty room, greasy food and soiled towels. Have you suffered a holiday from hell  Email webnews@mirror  Cheryl tried to move rooms but she was laughed at and says she was told another room aposcouldnapost magically appearapos. Speaking to Daily Star Online, Cheryl said: It was diabolical. We had booked the Ramada Hotel because it looked like a really nice five-star resort on the website. But when we arrived, the hotel was nice but everything  was diabolical... it was vile. Iaposve been on five star holidays before and I expected that kind of calibre again but this was far from it. As soon as we got there we werenapost happy, it was quite late at night but we could see it was filthy.  If you looked at the room with the naked eye you thought it was okay but when you looked closer it was vile. We put our bags down in the room and tried to speak to a receptionist there and then but she informed us nothing could be done as the hotel was fully booked and there wasnapost a way we could change rooms. Gary said we should grab a drink and sort it out in the morning so thataposs what we did but the next day we had the same problem so we decided to speak to a TUI rep. In a bid to make the most of their holiday, Cheryl and Gary tried to put the state of the room behind them. But things worsened when the couple went to dinner and found food drenched in grease. The -year-old said: The food was awful - it was generally very greasy and lukewarm.    You would find some evenings there would be sprouts and the next day it would be put in the salads! The food was swimming in grease and the majority of it was inedible. You could tell the staff were unhappy as well, they looked sad and downtrodden. As the week went on the couple tried to see the funny side and took a sad picture outside the resort aimed at reflecting their time at the Ramada. The -year-old and her partner were once again left feeling disgusted after cleaners delivered them poo-stained sheets. Cheryl said: One of the days the cleaners served us with towels and it had poo on it.    I went down to reception and was served with dirty towels - they did then send up clean ones but it shouldnapost have happened in the first place. Gary and Cheryl also claim the pool wasnapost cleaned for the entire time that they were there. She said: On one afternoon my boyfriend lost his ring and I asked the reception to let us known when the pool had been cleaned and they said they would once it had been. I went back nearly every day that I was there, this happened on the third day and I went every day three times a day and the entire time I was there the pool wasnapost cleaned. I just feel as though it was a complete s***hole - it was a s*** pit and TUI didnapost give a clear indication of what the hotel was - it wasnapost for couples.

In July the teenager initially told police she had been gang-raped by a group of Israeli tourists - who were arrested - but later retracted the claim. The Israelis were then released without charge. However Justice Abroad, who are assisting the woman, claim she was given undue pressure by Cypriot Police to retract her allegations. They say she was subjected to an eight-hour interrogation at a police station without a lawyer in contravention of Cypriot Constitutional Law and European Union provisions.

Rhys Manderson was driving on north Hull when he saw a woman running out of a house filled with black smoke and then tripping over.The -year-old slammed on his brakes, rang  and then heard the woman scream that her little girl was trapped in the burning property, reports Hull Live.Mr Manderson ran inside to try and save the child.    I covered my mouth with my coat and tried to run up the stairs to rescue the four-year-old girl that I was told was trapped in her bedroom, he said. As soon as I hit the top of the stairs the intensity and heat and pressure struck me - I didnapost realise how bad it would be and I breathed in a lot of the smoke up there. I broke the windows but couldnapost see the girl and ran out again as I think the mum had given me the wrong room in all the panic, as when I came back out she said her daughter was actually in the back bedroom.    I had about two or three goes at saving her and screaming for her and was panicking myself by then and ran around the back and smashed the window with a shovel. I was hanging off the ledge at one point trying to get her out and thought to myself aposthis is really bad and Iaposm not sure weaposre going to get to herapos. Then the firefighters arrived and barged the door down and saved her and were in and out by the time I dropped back to the ground. Smoke was constantly billowing from the house and the outside was completely black with soot as horried neighbours looked on, with Mr Manderson unable to get to the girl because the smoke was too thick. The experience was a scary one for him, but his only concern at the time was for the little girl. It was real scary at the time. At first I thought I was invincible and that I would be fine by covering my mouth with a coat. I also used to be a swimmer so thought I could hold my breath for at least two and a half minutes, but the pressure of the smoke and heat forced me to breathe. My leg hair was singed with the heat and I was in there for three or four minutes and the fire was just getting worse - all I could hope was that the girl would be okay.  In my head, I was sure anyone would try and rescue someone in that situation, or at least attempt to do it, but there were lots of people just stood about watching, perhaps in shock. I was so relieved when she was saved and Iaposm so happy she got out and that the family are now recovering and rebuilding their lives. It was little Bella Walker who attends McMillan Nursery School that Mr Manderson tried to save. Bellaaposs mum Samantha Walker said she was so grateful to him for trying to help the family and was so relieved that her child pulled through after treatment in hospital. I canapost thank the man who stopped and helped me enough, everything could have been so dferent. I would also like to thank the emergency services and the doctors at the hospital on ward  who were so good. Everyone has been so brilliant. Iaposm still trying to come to terms with it, but it will come one day. The nightmares are starting now. At first when I was asleep all I could see was the black smoke and that felt safer than being awake. Iaposm so grateful itaposs not far worse. When Bella got to hospital she was on  breaths a minutes and that soon went to . We had three childrenaposs hospitals on standby but she recovered and sheaposs such a strong girl. They tried to send me for my treatment at Castle Hill but I wanted to be with her. When I was going up to see her I was waiting for the lts and they were taking too long so a lot of the time I was walking up the stairs with my drip.    It took me longer to recover because I kept running into the smoke to get up the stairs. She had managed to protect herself in her room with her duvet. “Bella has made such a speedy recovery but she still gets upset when she talks about home. It will take time to sink in and she has suffered a very traumatic experience. The family are currently staying at Mr Walkeraposs parents house in Hessle, although have been in touch with emergency housing as they are now classed as homeless. Mrs Walker said their home in north Hull is now classed as uninhabitable and will be for a year. Peter Crutchley and his crew members put on their breathing gear and the training and adrenalin kicked in when they were deployed to the fire. Peter ran upstairs and head a murmuring in a back bedroom and there he found little Bella barely conscious under the bed. “I couldn’t tell what everyone  was doing but I was focused on going in the house,” he said. “I ran upstairs and heard a faint murmur and I found Bella under the bed. I picked her up and dashed downstairs.

The Queen and the rest of the Royal Family looked in their element as they celebrated with the happy couple at Windsor Castle. But according to a report it was a very dferent story shortly afterwards, and the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex faced disappointment when the Monarch rejected a request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times , the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle. The report, written by Rosa Nikkah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.    But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead, which they have since spent an astounding £.million of taxpayersapos money refurbishing. Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate. He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there.    When they were dating Meghan moved into Prince Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. However shortly before the birth of Archie Harrison the couple moved into their new home, later than expected due to delays with the renovation work. List most things royal, most of the details about their new home have been kept secret - but there are a few things we do know. The couple enlisted the help of designer Vicky Charles, who is behind the decor at their favourite hangouts Soho House, to turn the building into their dream home.    Itaposs understood to be filled with all the latest tech and itaposs likely that they are able to control many dferent things from their phones. A source  told royal expert Katie Nicholl  : They are going all out with the refurbishment of the house, and as Harry loves his gadgets, it’s going to be very cool. They’ll be able to control everything from their smart phones. Itaposs understood that one the couple are also had a £, eco boiler installed, which means they will have access to hot water at all times. Frogmore Cottage is just  metres from the Long Walk - which is open to the public - so there is obviously a lot of security, which is also funded by the taxpayer.    Other entrances to the grounds are further from their new home - some just  metres away - but are further from open scrutiny, leading to fears they could be easily accessed.  Itaposs likely that they will have built a separate annex for their Private Protection Officers who will guard them  hours a day. A source close to the operation say planners have also discussed including as state of the art panic room.

Instead, she seeks out other family members, particularly her older granddaughter Zara Tindall and her rugby player husband Mike. Ingrid told the Sun Online: They are certainly light relief. She can be herself around them.    The Tindalls, who arenapost working royals, are known for being some of the most relaxed and down-to-earth members of the family. They are often seen out and about at events, and just last month Mike was pictured being very hands on with his kids Mia and Lena at a charity golf day. Zaraaposs mum Princess Anne decided not to give her daughter a HRH title, knowing she wouldnapost be high up the list of succession. This has allowed her to live a much more aposnormalapos le than her senior cousins, who have been in the limelight their entire lives. Ingrid also believes that the Queen would never get involved in any dramas between Kate, Meghan, William and Harry.    Speaking about the reported fallout between the Fab Four, she said: That would make her very sad. But she would never interfere with their lives. Itaposs been a dficult month for Meghan and Harry in particular as they were heavily criticised for taking four private planes in just  days. The couple were branded hypocrites for choosing to travel in private planes, estimated to use seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight, while campaigning for action on climate change and further steps to protect the environment and wildle. Things were made even worse when Kate and William were seen taking Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis on a budget economy flight just a few days later.  The -seat Cessna plane that flew Meghan, Harry and Archie from the UK to the south of France last Wednesday belched seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight, it is estimated. They also flew privately for their holiday to Ibiza the week before. A number of celebrities rushed to their defence, including Elton John who shared an emotional message referencing Princess Diana. He wrote: I am deeply distressed by today’s distorted and malicious account in the press surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s private stay at my home in Nice last week.    Prince Harry  ’s Mother, Diana Princess Of Wales was one of my dearest friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death.After a hectic year continuing their hard work and dedication to charity, David and I wanted the young family to have a private holiday inside the safety and tranquility of our home.

The  feet high by  feet long piece of graffiti has been branded “sheer vandalism”. It was painted overnight and blots the view for royal visitors to the monarchaposs favourite home. The matter was first brought to royal attention by guests of Her Majesty who spotted it from Royal Windsor Way – a dual carriageway that brings them into the historic town. A royal source said: The Queen was not happy at all to hear that what for many of her guests is their first view of Windsor Castle has been turned into a very ugly eyesore.  “Her aides have been asked to see what can be done to have this gratuitous vandalism cleaned up and have the views across to Windsor Castle restored to their former beauty”. The vandal responsible is not known. The word HELCH has been scrawled on dozens of other sites in and around London including many bridges on the M, M and M. HELCH has also been emblazoned on London railway and tube station bridges and lots of disused buildings around the capital.    It is not known what it means but the Urban Dictionary suggests it is a shortening of “hiccup” and “belch” or a shortening of “hell yes” or it could be the “tag” of the actual artist. West Windsor Residents Association chairman Richard Endacott said: The Royal Windsor Way is the gateway into our town and is the first view that you get of Windsor Castle.  “For this piece of vandalism to ruin this view is just devastating and I am sure the Queen will not be impressed and it is essential that action is taken to restore a one fantastic view. “However much it costs we have .m tourists visiting Windsor Castle each this year and this should not be their first sighting of it and the sort of memory they take away of it. “When the person who did it caught he should have to pay for the cost of cleaning it up. It is illegal to graffiti like this and it is a criminal offence and it blights our town” he said.  Local Susan Roberts said: It is quite incredible that someone can paint something as big as this with such precision which must have taken several nights and nobody notices  The three mile single track railway between Windsor and Slough was opened in  and the original wooden trestles were replaced by this  yard long brick viaduct in .The line was used by Queen Victoria’s royal steam train and the famous playing fields of Eton College where Prince Harry and William went to school lay on the other side of it.The station was totally rebuilt for her Diamond Jubilee is  and the royal waiting room including her “throne” room complete with toilet and wash basin are still there today. The viaduct takes the railway over the River Thames across the world’s only wrought iron bridge still in regular use which was designed by Isambard Brunel and is Grade  listed.  The viaduct has been the target of graffiti in the past but Network Rail who are responsible for the upkeep have said they will only remove itit is actually obscene or offensive.

There was no education on how to be sun safe - our motto was always aposburn first then youaposll get really brownapos.  She continued: It was a generation of madness - in between holidays, I would have a sunbed rented and put in my spare bedroom. I would use it twice a day sometimes spending at least an hour each time cooking away listening to the Top . I didnapost even think about the risks of using a sunbed and I started sunbathing at the age of , Iaposd never even heard of the word aposmelanomaapos until after I finished university, I went travelling in America with a friend and while in Florida, Two guys used to call us the aposMelanoma Girlsapos because we used to go sunbathing on the beaches over there. On holidays, my friends and I would go on holiday and lie in the sun all day drinking. Weaposd start on the factor  and then just switch to oil - to us, suncream meant that we wouldnapost get a tan. We were like rotisserie chickens, turning regularly to get that even all-round glow. Despite her earlier sunbed addiction, skin cancer had never been on Susannaaposs mind until  when she had a benign mole removed from underneath her left foot. But she also had a mole on her right leg that she had been aware of that didnapost look right as it was pink and began to get bigger. Susanna claims when she visited doctors on two separate occasions in  and , they dismissed the lump as nothing to worry about. She said: I showed the mole to the consultant dermatologist while he was doing the procedure on my foot and he said it was fine - though he didnapost seem to look at it properly, not even using the dermascope.    I went to my GP again about six months later for something  and I asked them to have a look at the mole again as the colour and shape had changed. The GP ran her finger over it and said it was fine and nothing to worry about. I had it checked a couple more times, but there was no concern about it and I was just told to keep an eye on it - it was quite bizarre. When Susannaaposs daughter Tegan, , asked her to take her to the doctor for a mole she was worried about, she searched for an app that could be used to keep track of it. She discovered SkinVision, which allows anyone worried about skin spots or blemishes take a photograph which the app will analyse and tell them whether they are right to be worried within  seconds. Susanna decided to give it a try on her leg mole, and was shocked when it instantly came back with a aposhigh riskapos assessment and suggested she visited her doctor - an action she believes saved her le. She went to see her GP again, showing her the app and the images, and was referred to a hospital dermatologist on an urgent pathway. Luckily after the mole, diagnosed as basal cell carcinoma, was removed earlier this year the cancer had not spread and Susanna needed no further treatment, but has been told to keep a close eye on her other moles going forward.

First-time home buyers Hayley Butcher and Charlie Moss heard a loud bomb-like explosion in the middle of the night at their home in Canterbury, Kent. They were shocked to find the ceiling above their front door had completely broken off, sending large slabs of concrete falling on the floor and shattering the ceramic tiles below. The couple said thatany of them were standing beneath the ceiling at the time, they would have died. Hayley, who works at a jewellery shop in Whitstable, Kent, said: You donapost expect to wake up to your house falling down. Itaposs horrendous. It sounded like a bomb had gone off.    She continued: We just donapost know how on earth the house fell down in the middle of the night. Is it safe to live here  They havenapost got an explanation which is a bit concerning because you think it wasnapost windy, there wasnapost a storm. Itaposs so hard to buy for the first time. You get on the ladder and you just donapost expect that kind of devastation. Itaposs just heartbreaking. Itaposs really heartbreaking. The couple were left disorientated when they were woken up in the dark by a loud bang. When they went to investigate, they could see the centre of their house had collapsed, between their bedroom and en-suite bathroom. Charlie, , said: You hear a big bang and obviously itaposs a shock. Youaposre confused, you donapost know whataposs going on. My initial thought is to look out the window and see whataposs actually going on - was it a car or someone trying to get in the front door but no it wasnapost. It was a collapse of the front of our house causing major damage to both the canopy above the door and the tiling on the front. There was a lot of weight coming down there and had it been a few hours later on your way to work, shutting the door behind yourself, it could have been quite major. It just overshadows buying a new home most definitely.

She later apologised for the aposinsensitiveapos comments which drew ire from major celebrities on both sides of the pond. The impromptu crowd gathered outside the Good Morning America building in Times Square yesterday and undertook a series pirouettes and other moves in support of the #BoysDanceToo social media movement.    The video was shared numerous times by other dancers who wanted to show that boys should be able to pursue their passion without the threat of being mocked by others. The gang of male and female dancers was led by dancer Travis Wall who was sharply critical of Lara Spenceraposs comments and previously spoke about the bullying he received as a young dance student. He said:  dancers showed up for a ballet class this morning in Times Square. Getting to teach young men and women and getting to share stories was one of the most beautul mornings I’ve ever had! I love our dance community!!!  #voicesheard #ballet   #boysdancetoo   #ilovedance. Broadway actor Jordan Roth wrote: This is epically beautul! Actor and drag artist Shangela wrote: YES!

It’s a NEW DAY!    During the segment aired last week, Spencer revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs eldest child would be studying maths, science, history, religious studies, computer programming, poetry and ballet. After Spencer said ballet, some members of the studio audience laughed, as did the presenter and her fellow host George Stephanopoulos.

Despite spending her days helping people and making them feel at ease, she knew that she wasnapost happy and it time for a change. She moved to LA to pursue her passion for stand-up comedy, but after a few months she made another huge move that would change her le forever - signing up to become an adult film star. The -year-old loves her job, and can make more than £, for just a few hours work, but the impact it has had on her parents still really upsets her. Speaking to , she said: The hardest part is knowing that my family are dealing with my career as much as I am. I want my parents to be just as proud of me as they were when I was working in medicine. I never wanted my parents to feel like failures. I have a college degree.    I had plenty of options but I chose sex. That bothered a lot of people including my family. I would love for my family to be proud of me and introduce me as their daughter who works in sex, rather than having to go to family reunions and pretend Iaposm someone . Iaposm proud of what I do. At first her parents were extremely against her decision but Sylvia says they are now slightly more accepting. My father is more understanding than my mother, my mother has religion. Obviously he says that as his daughter he wishes I wasnapost doing it. He understands that Iaposm safe, happy and making good decisions for myself. We donapost talk about the details. There is nothing about my le that is private any more. Everything is there for the public to see. Itaposs very freeing. Itaposs nice knowing that there is nothing anyone has on me because I have put it all out there.    Silviaaposs work in the adult industry has opened lots of other doors for her, and she now also hosts her own show and co-hosts a sex podcast. She desperately wants to help get rid of the negative connotations around sex and the adult film industry. She said: I made it my mission to start talking about sex. We put so much shame around it. So Iaposve just been talking sex with everybody. Sylvia has been working in the adult movie industry for five years, and says it is now just completely normal to her. She now does between three and five shoots a week, and can earn about £, a time. Itaposs all very quick but it becomes so routine that I donapost even think about it anymore. It just becomes part of my job. A typical shoot can take anywhere between two and six hours. Itaposs an early start and Silvia will have to be on set for about am. The first job is to sign all the paperwork confirming she hasnapost drunk alcohol or taken drugs. Itaposs then time for hair and make-up which takes about an hour and a half. They then do an inidual photoshoot, known as the apospretty girl photosapos, before being introduced to their partner for the first time. Itaposs then time for more photos, this time together acting out each of the sexual positions they will be in during the film. Silvia has worked in the industry for so long that she knows most of the male actors she works with, however there are a lot more women actors so itaposs often a new face.  They then work through their aposyes and no listapos, the things they are not comfortable doing during the filming.  Silviaaposs include no hitting in the face, no spitting and no negative comments. This all takes about ten minutes and then itaposs straight onto filming which takes up to  minutes. She said:  per cent of my days I really enjoy myself. I have a lot of fun at work, Iaposm laughing all day.  per cent of the time itaposs like a real job. You donapost always like the company youaposre with, you might not like the director. She didnapost get into the industry until she was , slightly older than others. She said: After several years working I found myself very unhappy so I started doing standup. She took two jobs to pay the bill while she tried to make a name for herself in comedy, but after six month she decided to find out more about the adult industry. One of her friends worked as an adult film star and was making huge amounts of cash. She said: I wasnapost doing any comedy, and that was the reason I moved to LA. If I could make more money I could focus on comedy. And her plan worked and her work in the adult industry gave her the financial flexibility to work on her standup.  After three years of hard work her comedy started to really take off. She said: I identied with myself a bit more. I just found my feet in both comedy and adult and gained more confidence. My name was getting out there a bit. Confidence is key in both professions. They run very closely hand in hand. Being in entertainment is about knowing what people want to hear and see. Silvia says that while people often recognise her when sheaposs out and about, most of them wonapost approach her at the time and will message her on Twitter instead.I think people are embarrassed that they recognise me. There should be no embarrassment there. Iaposm someone they watch on a regular basis and to me thataposs flattering.

London-based Jonathan and Hannah Goldstein were flying from Switzerland to Italy on Sunday morning when their aircraft crashed in Simplon Pass and burst into flames. Goldstein Music Group founder Jonathan had worked on Martin Scorseseaposs Cape Fear and won an Ivor Novello Award in  for his score to the BBC HBO film Primo. Hannah, who performed under the name Hannah Marcinowicz, had worked with the London Symphony Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra and was a regular performer with BBC Proms. A hiker, who was walking in the Simplon Pass area with his family on Sunday, said he saw the horrying crash unfold after he spotted two burning objects fall and then heard two huge bangs. Christian Merz, , from Dorneck, Switzerland told Blick he saw two people rush towards the aircraft in a desperate bid to help, but they were unable to get near to it due to the flames.  Police later confirmed three people, including a baby, had died in a plane crash, which happened at around .am. The coupleaposs neighbour Ankita, , told thethat she was told the sad news by Hannahaposs father late last night. Stay-at-home mum Ankita said: We were friendly with each other. Weaposve only lived here about three months. They have a pet rabbit and we both have little ones. I started speaking to Hannah quite often about six weeks ago. She askedI could look after Rufus because they said they were going on vacation.  We were out yesterday and when we ed, I noticed the hutch was missing.  I tried ringing Hannah and Jonathan but their phones werenapost connecting. Hannah had given me her parents numbers for emergency so I called her dad last night. I said I was sorry to ring so late as it was about .pm but I couldnapost find Rufus. He said there was a tragic accident and three of them died. After that, I donapost remember what happened as I started crying. Hannah had said they were going to Italy and the weather might be bad. I started crying when I was speaking to him.    I still cant believe it, I couldnapost sleep last night. Her husband Pavan, , who is an IT consultant, said Hannahaposs dad didnapost know exactly what had happened when his we spoke to them last night - just that there had been a tragic accident. The couple had set off in their Piper PA- Arrow aircraft from London on Saturday morning and landed in Troyes, France before making a second stop in Lausanne, Switzerland where they are believed to have stayed over night, reports Le Matin . Local police said the family then set off from the Vaudois airfield in western Switzerland for Perugia, Umbria, at around am the following day but tragically crashed just over an hour into the flight.  The Federal Safety Investigation Authorityhave launched an investigation, but it is currently unclear what may have caused the crash on the route through the mountains which connects Switzerland and northern Italy. The couple had reportedly been married for three years and had acquired the Piper PA- Arrow several years ago, according to their social media accounts. Jonathan was the founder and creative director of Goldstein Music Group, which produces and sources music for advertising, broadcast and film and has worked with HBO, the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company. He reached no. in the Official UK Classical Charts in  with his track Magical Moments and his company won a raft of awards for their scores on adverts for big name brands like Gillette, Volvo, Heineken and Sky Movies.  A project Jonathan worked on for NSPCC, led by then Saatchi  Saatchi creative director Dave Droga, was his proudest work, he said. NSPCCaposs Real Children Donapost Bounce Back, below, won more than  Golds from creative awards including Cannes Lions and The Creative Circle. He told Little Black Book in  interview: “I think it was the hardest challenge I had ever been presented with, and probably ever will be - Scoring horrendous acts of violence being committed against a cartoon child and making it as funny as possible. All the first drafts of the score were rejected because they weren’t aposfunny enough.apos It was a surreal and painful experience but, my God, did they know what they were doing. I think it must be the bravest project I have ever worked on, with one of the most brilliant creative teams ever.  Hannah was an acclaimed saxophonist and has performed at the London Symphony Orchestra, Philharmonia Orchestra and BBC Concert Orchestra.She has performed at the Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Barbican Centre to great critical acclaim. Hannah, who was awarded a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Music, had said her stand-out moment was towards the end of her time at the academy, when she had a solo part at the BBC Proms, conducted by Colin Davis. She told the Watford Observer in : “Music that strikes me is music that really moves me. “As musicians we draw influences from so many dferent areas and I find personally, I am most moved by the simplicity of a beautul melody.  “It is actually hard to compose a tune successfully, as often with music less is more – it is knowing where to leave things out. It is also then the performer’s job to bring that music to le.” The couple had recently collaborate on their own project, The London Golden Sax Project, which they described as a unique rediscovery of London’s song heritage from the Oliver-esque street seller’s cry of ‘Will You Buy’ to the timeless classic of ‘A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square’. They said they created evocative musical soundscapes celebrating the old and the new, blending the ethereal world of choir and organ with the modern world of saxophone and strings.

Callie Rogers said she wishes she had never bought the winning ticket back in  when she was just . Now  and a mother-of-one, she says she was too young and the windfall left her open to being exploited. The first things she splashed out on were houses for herself and some of her family, as well as cars, and gts for other people.She told the Today show : “I liked being able to help my family and doing stuff for people I cared about, but I wanted to just go back to work and live my normal le again.“All of a sudden I couldn’t open my front door with photographers and stuff being there and, obviously, you have people begging for money, friends who weren’t friends before wanting to be your friends.”    And from there things spiralled out of control as people she didnapost know tried to take her money and sell stories about her. Even an ex tried to sell a story that she was addicted to cocaine, she said. She added:that’s what I had done, when I hadn’t - He was going to get a lot of money off it. It was easier for me to admit it so he didn’t make any money out of me at the time and, obviously, I didn’t realise it was going to be a big story and it has continued to live with me  years on. Callie is now earning just £, a year as a carer and living in a £-a-month rented home.  And she insisted: “I am the happiest I have ever been.” But she revealed she is still owed £, by “fake pals” who took her debit card to buy Macbooks and gts for themselves as she partied at the height of her fame. Speaking to The Mirror earlier this month, she said: “I loaned £, here, £, there. I would never get it back. “People asked for money for new cars and I would help out. I was a soft touch. Now I realise what they were like. “I was exploited because of my age. I had a lot of fake relationships.”  She said there were advisers provided to her on how to manage her money, but said that at that age you don’t have any concept of that amount of money or what to do with it. “You are only a , with all that responsibility. At that age, you can get the best advice ever, she said. “But you are not in a position to listen. I was too young. Overnight I went from carefree child to adult. All these years on, it still gets dragged up. “Even when I go for job interviews, I am thinking about it. I suffer from such bad anxiety when I am going to meet new people. It preys on my mind, what a new partner’s family will think of me, or even new friends. I still get abuse just because of who I am.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d63e2fec534c2.18919648-406x564.jpg ","title":"bard of salford john cooper clarke promises a right good night in dundee visit","story":"John Cooper Clarke is ready to rock# and Dundee should be afraid, very afraid.He may be in his older years, but he is not holding back.And the man known as the punk poet has vowed to perform in his unmistakable style – machine gun delivery studded with factory floor language.The rasping Salford accent is still there and the humour as cutting as a surgeon’s scalpel.And for the real devotees, John has teased them by telling the Tele exclusively that he has begun planning his memoirs.In typical fashion he says: “I haven’t kept a f****** diary, but I have got a good memory.“In fact, my memory is long and my vengeance is total.”To the musicians and celebs who have crossed JCC in the past, start praying now because the master could even recall the gig I saw him perform at Strathclyde University in the early s and who was playing on the same bill.For the record, it was Siouxsie and the Banshees – and I couldn’t remember that, despite being a few years younger than the man.Back in the day, John easily recalls everyone being angry young men and women. The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back. So look out for many more tours to come from the man who wants to be yours."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42835544-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42835544-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42835544-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42835544-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"blether england goalie swift had hands the size o luggies said hector","story":"A BwB article in April triggered memories for Rob Boag.For his latest offering, he said: “His name lay dormant, cramped into a crevice of memory for more than half-a-century.“And there he was in an April BwB article – Billy Houliston – and my mind began to release Billy like a genie from a bottle.“Along with Billy, other names surfaced such as Billy Steel, Lawrie Reilly, Jimmy Mason, Willie Waddell and the brilliant Jimmy Cowan.“These are names of legends and ghosts from the past.“I was  years of age in April  when my family were huddled around the wireless listening to England v Scotland at Wembley.BLETHER: #Basher# Billy Houliston lived up to nickname and gave England #discomfort#\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp basher-lived-up-to-nickname-and-gave-england-discomfort embed # secretsCJnnwsFTq\" data-secret\"sCJnnwsFTq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“After the kick-off, England’s attack on Scotland’s goal was relentless and, for the first  minutes, it was Scotland’s goalkeeper Jimmy Cowan v England.“Time after time, just when the commentator was about to call a goal for England, Cowan’s fingertips deflected the ball over the bar or past the post.“Cowan played a blinder.“Then, slowly and surely, Scotland broke free from the English siege and, with the talents and brilliance of Steel, Mason and Waddell and the hustle of Houliston, the Scots began to control the game and dominate England.“It finished a - victory for the Scots.

For me, the s squad does not bother me. There have been thousands of boys down the years that’ve got  caps in the s and never had a career in the game.“For us it’s about first-team football, getting them into our team and seeing what happens after that.”That desire to get his kids first-team football is why Robbie has loaned out the likes of Declan Glass and Matty Smith, both now at Cove Rangers.Youth players Alassan Jones and Michael McArthur have also gone out to juniors Broughty Athletic, who were instrumental in Appere’s development last season.“There is no point in having guys here that are real good prospects and not getting them a game.“They just end up fading out and their career gets ruined.“We have to make sure we give them the best opportunity to play here.“If they are not quite there yet then they go somewhere  and come back in six months# time but, when they do, we have to make sure there is an opportunity for them here.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/cammy-kerr.jpg ","title":"no derby talk at dens says cammy kerr as they focus on inverness clash","story":"There’s absolutely no derby talk at Dens Park says Cammy Kerr as first of all Dundee get ready for a tough Championship test against Inverness tomorrow.The Dark Blues welcome their Highland opponents to Dens Park for the second time this season after knocking John Robertson’s side out of the Betfred Cup last month.The attention for plenty fans, of both dark blue and tangerine persuasion, has already switched to next Friday’s derby.Kerr accepts there’s nothing that can be done about that but insists the players are doing no such thing.He told the Tele: “Everyone  must be thinking of that and it can be hard sometimes to ignore the distractions with everything that goes on seeing online that people have got their tickets and stuff like that.“But as players we know we have a really tough game against Inverness first tomorrow.“That’s our focus and once that’s done we move on to the next one.“That’s why we are supposed to be professional football players because you have to stay professional.“You have to stay focused, know what the aims are and that is only looking at tomorrow.“It’s all about getting a result tomorrow.“We are under no illusions how good Inverness are.“We had a really tough game against them in the Betfred Cup, though I thought we were the better team.“They are a really good side and John Robertson always has them set up well, so we need to make sure our tactics and performance are spot on.”The warning for the Dark Blues is that, by Inverness’ recent history in this ision as one of the strongest teams, they’ll be better than they were during that - loss at Dens.Cammy added: “I think they will have improved since going out to us in the cup.“That would have been deflating and then they got turned over by United the following week and that will have been a wake-up call.“They are not used to getting turned over like that in this league because they are always a good, competitive side.“We need to make sure we are at it come tomorrow.”He added: “I think we have improved since then as well.“We have a couple more signings in the door, the squad is starting to come together and there will be excitement after the performance last week.“Even after the Ayr game, there was a real buzz about the place in the stands.“People have been telling me they feel the buzz in the stands before games and that’s great to hear.“If we can get that again this weekend it really helps.“Looking at the fixtures, tomorrow will be three home games in a row and then United, so that’s still in the city and then another home game after that.“That’s a time to, hopefully, build a foundation to kick on for the rest of the season.”Dundee got a lot of plaudits for the way they went about the Aberdeen match last weekend.Kerr says, though that is nice to hear, the result still stung.“We took a lot from the game last week. We’re still hurting, though, because it was a scalp we could have taken and we were a couple of minutes from taking it.“To do that would have been great and the sucker punch at the end killed that but the boys are happy with the performance.

Figures for this year have shown a slight increase with roughly  cars per day – % of its capacity.Peter Argyle, chairman of Nestrans, said: “Ellon is doing really well because it is in the right place.“It is in a place where people can come down from Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Ellon itself and can easily park and get a bus into the centre of town.“It has been a success ever since it opened and we’ve had to expand it because it is doing so well.“The challenge for park and rides closer to the city is, by the time people have got to the roundabout at Craibstone, they think they are already so close to the city.“It is harder at this moment to persuade them to leave their car when they are as close to the city as that.“People can park relatively easily and cheaply in the city centre.“It is no criticism of any local authority or any transport provider, I think it is about driver behaviour.“People want to drive as close as they can to where they are going.”However, community leaders in Ellon have spoken of their frustration over the long-running saga over the expansion at the site.Aberdeenshire Council first submitted plans to improve the facility more than seven years ago and the local authority has yet to reveal a completion date, with a final third phase still to take place.Work had started to clear trees from the site so it could be expanded, with a bus-turning area created and additional car parking spaces.Phase two of the project will focus on the bus-turning area and creating three bus stops with enclosed shelters that will be lit and have real-time displays.Phase one saw the addition of  car parking spaces and new signs.Expansion plans have been delayed due to issues obtaining the land required.Ellon councillor Richard Thomson said: “Ellon Park and Ride is a much-valued facility in the area. It’s good to see these figures showing a consistently high level of usage.“For large parts of rural Aberdeenshire there’s no alternative to car ownership for many people. However, park and ride sites help to integrate public and private transport and give a sensible, cheap and quick alternative to driving into Aberdeen.“It’s clear that many more people could be making use of Ellon Park and Ride, which is why the delays to the long-planned expansion project have been so disappointing.”Councillor Gillian Owen, who represents Ellon, said: “When it first opened, there was a financial incentive to go to the park and ride to catch the bus, and in reality that momentum has continued.“The bus service is more frequent from the park and ride at peak times. If your work is based in and around Union Street and Union Square, the journey time has reduced since the opening of the AWPR, and you are spoilt for choice when it comes to the stops for college and university.“Once Phase Two is complete, the facilities will be second to none and the capacity will increase and hopefully this will encourage more people to use the bus.“I’m extremely disappointed that the final phase of upgrades to the PR has still to be finalised despite constant pushing and pricing of officers.”Councillor Isobel Davidson, who also represents Ellon, said: “The location suits people well and the PR then takes people into the city centre without the need to find and pay for a parking space.“It is also a relatively safe place to leave the car for longer periods so ideal for catching the airport bus or onward travel at the railway station.“The figures for Ellon Park and Ride show it is working slightly below capacity. However, with the proposed extension, it can be promoted more widely as a park and chose location for car-sharing and those travelling by bus could leave electric cars charging or bikes in safe lockers.“Perhaps someday they could even travel on by train.”Councillor Anouk Kloppert, who also represents Ellon, said: “I think it’s doing well because the Ellon Park and Ride services not only cover Aberdeen City centre but also Inverurie, Dyce and Aberdeen airport with regular services.“The car park disabled parking spaces are monitored by CCTV, secure cycle storage, has indoor facilities and is staffed at regular hours although closed on Sunday.”A spokeswoman for Stagecoach North Scotland previously said “Park and ride facilities play a vital part in sustainable travel for Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.“One full bus can remove up to  car journeys from the road, reduce overall emissions levels and help improve air quality”.Aberdeenshire Council declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"heres to ewe gordon","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA -year-old  shepherd left the recent Mid Argyll Show with a clutch of prizes for his Texel sheep.Gordon MacLean, from Tarbert, saw off fine specimens of the Texel breed from more experienced sheep men and women to win the ewe lamb class.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows.

We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"farm open day creates a buzz","story":"The main attraction at last Sunday#s event was a huge field covered almost entirely in purple phacelia but there was also a patch of sunflowers # a feature at the farm last year too # and several patches of five and seven flower mixes.While some simply enjoyed wandering among the purple plants which caught the eyes of motorists on the A just north of Campbeltown for weeks, others took advantage of the other activities on offer.There were nature walks of three ying s, hot drinks and snacks for sale, and information boards about the plants and wildle to enjoy, as well as workshops on seeding and flower arranging.Some of the younger visitors also enjoyed tractor rides and a look at some of the farm animals.Farmer David Young explained that the phacelia, although eye-catching for its beautul purple flowers, was actually planted as a soil improving weed suppressor.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"filming-taking-place-port-seton-high-street","story":"A short film called Fishing by LS Productions means that a rolling road closure has been created.This is when the road is mainly open, but traffic will be lsquopausedrsquo to clear the road at times.It is a system commonly used in cycling and road events.There will also be parking restrictions in place.When asked, LS Productions marketing team informed the Courier that due to signing non-disclosure agreements, they were unable to say anything more about the film."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-39-struggling-39-families-sees-demand-kids-39-lunch-club-soar","story":"More than  children took part in this summerrsquos club compared to just  when it began in .And Universal Credit has been blamed for the dramatic increase in families who need help providing their children with a healthy meal, during the holidays.Sandra King, from Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership, who help fund the club, which runs in Prestonpans and Tranent, said there was no doubt the impact of East Lothian being used to pilot the roll-out of Universal Credit was being witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected.

Some of the older children come back and volunteer as well.As well as food, the club provides free toiletries and took the youngsters on trips over the holidays to places such as East Links Family Park, Dunbar.And free haircuts were provided by Cockenzie-based Unique salon.This week the club has been replaced with a unorm swap shop as school s next week."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-spent-musselburgh-racecourse-buildings","story":"The independent report on the condition of buildings at the historic course found the majority of it was in a satisfactory condition.However, it was critical of areas used by staff, which were in some parts described as being in a ldquopoor state.It said the racecourse workshop, which houses both staff from the course and other East Lothian Council amenity services, required an overhaul, calling for flooring which it described as ldquovery dirty to be given a deep clean ndash and the toilet facilities too.It said: ldquoThe electric shower, ceramic WCs and wash hand basins with chrome taps are in a poor condition and are either damagedor require a deep clean.East Lothian Council is currently seeking a third-party operator for the course, which is currently overseen by the Musselburgh Racing Associated Committee .The survey was carried out ahead of the tendering process to ensure the facilities were up to standard.The report acknowledged the age of some of the older buildings on the site but highlighted missing ceiling tiles and grouting work which needed to be fixed.It also urged operators to have a fire risk assessment carried out for the main grandstand to ensure the fire breaks in its roof space are sufficient.The report was one of a number which were presented to MRAC in private at the end of last year.They have now been released to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.It is understood that local tradespeople are being used to carry out the work detailedin the survey, which is expected to cost substantially less than the independent estimate of pound,.Racecourse general manager Bill Farnsworth said: ldquoWork is in progress to maintain standards around ious parts of the racecourse and the expenditure is reasonable for a sporting and leisure facility which welcomes , visitors a year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-affordable-homes-cockenzie-armed-forces-veterans","story":"The development at Osborne Terrace, Cockenzie, is being built to cater specically for disabled veterans and will consist of six two-bedroom flats.The building site was visited by Graeme Dey MSP, minister for parliamentary business and veterans on Tuesday morning.He said: ldquoAs veteransrsquo minister, itrsquos my job to ensure that we provide the right support for the Armed Forces community across Scotland.ldquoThe Scottish Government is fully committed to supporting the Armed Forces, veterans and their families, and to ensuring they are not disadvantaged by their service or the circumstance they find themselves in because of this.ldquoIt was a pleasure to visit Osborne Terrace to see the construction of these new, affordable homes for veterans.ldquoOur Armed Forces community deserves the best possible levels of support when they need it most ndash and this project is a great example of that.Construction started May with completion scheduled for December.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, East Lothian Councilrsquos spokesman for housing and its the Armed Forces Champion, said: ldquoThe move from service le to civilian le can present challenges for personnel and their families in a wide range of areas.ldquoThis new development is a shining example of working together with partners to provide much-needed housing for veterans with specic needs.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays.

Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Time to panic over Dad s Army reboot ","story":"Peaky Blinders, BBC****Sanditon, ITV****HOW would you like your Sunday evenings served, madam: with bare naked laddies, cuddly nostalgia, or machine guns  Those were the dining options as the main channels attempted to lock viewers in for the autumn.Peaky Blinders made the move from BBC as a reward for its Bafta-winning, young audience-grabbing ways, while ITV was offering Sanditon, which sounds like a DIY product but is in fact an unfinished Austen brought to a close by Andrew Davies, the writer who puts the bonking into bonnet and carriage dramas.But who do you think you are kidding, Mr Scheduler  For a certain vintage of viewer, the main event was Dadrsquos Army: the Lost Episodes.

This appears to be on the basis that Alex Salmondrsquos contrary claim is ldquounsupported by independent legal opinion . I would challenge that latter assertion.Ms Redingrsquos letter is itself unsupported by legal opinion. The situation of a member state splitting in two has not occurred in the history of the EU . So there is no legal precedent.However there is a legal precedent to support Mr Salmondrsquos case for a third country joining the EU without the requirement to go through any negotiations or any revision of the Treaties. When East Germany joined the EU in  it was deemed to be effective from the moment unication with West Germany took place. It was seen to be merely the enlargement of an existing member state with the new combined entity being called lsquoGermanyrsquo.:Neil Mackay: Where have all the big ideas on independence gone An independent Scotland would be in a similar situation, but this time as a third country formed by the reduction in size of an existing member state as opposed to enlargement. Unlike East Germany, however, it would already have met all the criteria for membership by dint of having been in the EU for  years. As such it would be unique and therefore unlike any other third country applying for membership. That is the key point.If the Commission stipulated that Scotland would require to apply for membership like all other third countries, it would have to explain to the European Court of Justice why the legal precedent established by East Germanyrsquos accession to the EU was being disapplied in this instance.By any measure this would be an extremely spurious legal argument for the Commission to advance, especially when Scotland has a stronger economy than East Germany had, was fully compliant with EU rules, and was a known and respected European country with no history of secret police involvement.

On the Yes side, nothing has substantively changed, when it comes to big ideas, since the SNP laid out its blueprint for independence in .Brexit has altered the backdrop of the constitutional debate, but apart from a decision by SNP members to support the creation of a new currency as quickly as possible after independence, which many Yes voters donrsquot agree with, therersquos been little in the way of political imagination, creativity and innovation. The plan for Citizensrsquo Assemblies was visionary but itrsquos been undermined by SNP politicisation.Thatrsquos not to say that hard work hasnrsquot been done on the nuts and bolts of independence. The SNPrsquos Growth Commission report on the finances of an independent Scotland presented some serious economic thinking, but this is not the stuff upon which visions of new nations are built, this is the stuff of the seminar room.: Neil Mackay:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideThe No side is even worse. All thatrsquos heard from the No camp is the word lsquoNorsquo. Wherersquos their vision of what a Scotland remaining in the union will look like  Brexit has shown both the Tories and Labour to be intellectually bankrupt when it comes to the future of Scotland. Yoursquod get more vision walking around a darkened room with your eyes closed than you would listening to most unionist politicians in Scotland.The new co-leader of the Scottish Green Party, Lorna Slater, seems to share concerns about the level of intellectual debate around the future of Scotland. She too worries about the vision thing.Slater has identied a few problems. Firstly, the impression that the SNP ldquoowns the idea of independence. Many Yes voters donrsquot support the SNP ndash yet itrsquos the SNP which dictates most of the discussion around independence. When a monolithic, managerial party controls debate then the drain on vision wersquore experiencing is inevitable. Whatrsquos good for the SNP in terms of holding on to power isnrsquot necessarily in the best interests of independence.A resurgence of all those grassroots Yes organisations which sprung up as the first referendum approached would provide an intellectual counterweight to the SNP, and a laboratory for new ideas.Slater is also concerned that ldquomuch of the debate around independence has focused on whether or not there should be a referendum. We should be focusing on what we want an independent Scotland to look like.Shersquos right. A second referendum will happen at some stage in the relatively near future, but what really matters,you are a Yes voter, is making sure the vision for the country is in place in order to convince the people that independence is the right course of action when the time comes.Brexit has taught us hard lessons. There was no real discussion, no real vision, about what a post-Brexit Britain would look like. A national conversation needs to begin in Scotland about the kind of country we want to be after independence.What about a constitution  The monarchy  The nature of the army  Our relationship with America  A second parliamentary chamber  Our role in Europe These issues cannot be left up to the SNP. Politicians make decisions in the best interests of their party, not the country. Parties care about power not people.We need to know the substance of what wersquore voting for, rather than the intellectually bereft binary of Yes and No. The Greens are certainly setting out a clear vision for Scotland after independence. The environment will be the top priority, there will be a move away from oil and gas.Of course, the Greens also flatlined on around eight per cent of the vote during the European elections in May. However, that disappointment may account for their renewed push for a big vision for Scotland now.The Greens need to get out from under the shadow of the SNP. Being seen by voters as \"the other party which also supports independence\" isnrsquot a strategy, especially when Greens can provide a clear, progressive vision for the country which the SNP with its disparate factions cannot.The SNP is ready to splinter into left, right and centre the moment Scotland becomes independent. In the era of climate change, the Greens have a simple and important story to tell which other parties do not.However, honesty is the greatest storyline ndash the strongest vision ndash to present to Scotland. So letrsquos be honest. If Scotland votes Yes to independence in any future referendum, we need to accept that it is inevitable that the nation will need a confirmatory referendum on any deal negotiated with the rest of the UK regarding separation.Dr Alan Renwick, of University College Londonrsquos Constitution Unit, has raised this issue saying that a confirmatory vote would avoid the ldquoacrimony and gridlock of Brexit. He refers to the ldquograve democratic quandary where the public has not been allowed to make ldquoan informed choice about the type of Brexit the country goes through. Renwick suggests opting for a confirmatory vote might increase the turnout for Yes with the public willing to back independence in theory and then see what the politicians negotiate.A future independence referendum would be a ldquopre-legislative ballot, instructing politicians to negotiate a deal which we then vote on. That seems perfectly democratic and the kind of vision we need for this country.:Majority now want Scottish independence, says phenomenal new pollIt immediately shows a commitment to democracy over party politics, a willingness to tackle emotional and isive subjects in a collegiate way, and it projects an adult image of this nation while many other countries seem to be reverting to childhood.The First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and some of her inner circle may be publicly voicing their discomfort with the baggage that comes with the concept of nationalism of late, in an attempt to woo soft No voters, but the one thing which will change swithering minds is honestly tackling the dficulties which the journey towards independence will involve.It will not be easy - it will be hard. Admitting those dficulties is a good way to start presenting a vision of integrity and honour for a new independent Scotland.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"signalling-fault-edinburgh-haymarket-causes-delays-rush-hour-services","story":"Services fromHelensburgh Milngavie, Edinburgh and Glasgow Central and the Edinburgh via Shotts services wereall affected.:ScotRail given poundm-a-month bailout by Dutch taxpayersNEW: Theres a fault with the signalling system in the #Haymarket area, which is affecting services on our Helensburgh Milngavie - Edinburgh  Glasgow Central - Edinburgh via Shotts services.Engineers from @NetworkRailSCOT are on their way to the problem. ^Angus pic dzthsERhrEngineers have now resolved the issue and trains are ing to normal service."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10330358.jpg?type=article-full","title":"oscar-marzaroli-man-captured-forgotten-moments-glasgow-life","story":"The photograph is typical Oscar Marzaroli.

But Marzaroli worked primarily as a film-maker, making dozens of documentaries for the Highlands and Islands Development Board.His camera was ever present, however, and his photographs are now regarded by many as art.At an event at the university last night, Deacon Blue lead singer Ricky Ross launched a campaign to raise pound, to enable the entire collection to be made freely available online.The money is needed to carry out the work necessary to preserve, catalogue and digitise the images into a searchable online collection.Glasgow subway The image of the child at the bookshop window is one of  original prints, all but one developed by Marzaroli himself, to be auctioned to kick-start the fund in an event which runs until Thursday, September .Italian born, Oscar Marzaroli moved to Scotland at the age of two. He missed out on much formal education and did not go to art school as his brother had, largely as a result of childhood ill-health.He spent a year in Kingussie Sanatorium fighting TB in his late teens ndash there was doubt as to whether he would recover.

While there are contact sheets in some of Marzarolirsquos files, only around , of the images have ever been printed up, and there is no certainty about what is contained in many of the negatives.Some spools of film, retrieved from his camera bag, have never even been developed. Nicola says: ldquoThere are so many images, even we do not know what treasures our dad has left hidden in thereLaunching the appeal, singer-songwriter Ross said: ldquoI got in touch with Oscar after I became fascinated with his work, and he ended up coming out with us and shooting some photographs for our first Deacon Blue album in dferent locations.ldquoIrsquod told him about the idea of Raintown and he called me one day to say there was a picture he thought suited it.St Enoch SquareldquoItrsquos the one of the sunshine coming through the clouds. We loved it and our music from that period has been linked to Oscar ever since, he said.University archivist Carole McCallum says the Marzaroli Collection is of international importance. ldquoOscarrsquos photographs are instantly recognisable ndash particularly the iconic images he took in the Gorbals before the tenements were cleared away.Theyrsquove become rooted in popular culture, but people donrsquot realise Oscar worked all over Scotland and further afield both as a photographer and filmmaker.

Behind the headlines, the IPCC report includes a much more positive message about the potential agriculture has for helping to mitigate climate change.:Fe farmer bids to put buffalo mozzarella on the menuUnlike other sectors, agriculture can, through appropriate changes in land use and new land management practices, not only reduce its greenhouse gas emissions but sequester more carbon, offsetting emissions in other sectors.The same changes in land use and land management will also help stem the decline in bioersity and our natural resources, or what the economist Dieter Helm and others refer to as our ldquonatural capital.In his latest book ldquoGreen and Prosperous Land, Helm argues that protecting and enhancing our environment is one of the best investments that a society can make and that agriculture, with the support of appropriate policies, has a key role in moving us towards a sustainable future.The signs are that, post-Brexit, UK agricultural policy will place more, rather than less, emphasis on the environmental objectives of farming.It follows that farmers should welcome the increased attention being given to the environment.In reality, agri-environmental policies explicitly focused on ensuring farming delivers environmental public goods are not new. However, despite the clear and long-standing policy support for protecting the farmed environment, and notwithstanding recent commitments by farm lobby groups to achieving net-zero production, many farmers see their primary, and in some cases sole, role being that of producingfood.Why is this  In part it could be attributed to the nature of some past agri-environmental schemes.Many have been bureaucratically demanding while others have, inadvertently, included conditions which placed future farm support payments at risk.While some measures have clear environmental gains and are relatively easy for farmers to adopt, eg restoring peat bogs on land, not in productive use, often the schemes are necessarily more complex.:Five Scottish farm-themed wedding venuesNatural habitats need to be connected toeffectively, often across farm boundaries, therefore requiring new levels of co-operation between neighbouring farmers the right sort of trees need to be planted in the right types of land for net positive carbon sequestration to occur, and the time period within which the trees will generate income may not align with a farmerrsquos needs. However, new farming technologies and methods are emerging that will hopefully breakdown this  dichotomy between food production and environmental protection.Another example is agroforestry which provides productivity and welfare benefits to livestock as well as the carbon sequestration benefits from trees.The uptake of these and other agri-ecological approaches is being demonstrated by innovators in the sector and will be supported by UK policies, which recognise the importance of farm-based natural capital.Moreover, disruptive technologies are fast emerging which will provide yet more opportunities for the sector to show its environmental credentials.For example, indoor vertical farming offers huge environmental benefits in terms of reducing food waste, eliminating the need for agro-chemicals in crop production, reducing water requirements, and, by producing food where it is needed, reducing food miles and sparing land. A recent Scottish Government study found that  per cent of the public rated the environment as one of the top three government portfolios that should be prioritised in terms of spending.Agriculture came much further down the list, with just % of the public rating it. In particular, over half of the participants in the forumwanted to see a greater share of agricultural support funding going to support the natural environment. The publicrsquos views were changed.

The nine-nil reverse at Celtic Park was undeniably sore and damaging to the football club.However, it was fty-nine minutes of complete and utter madness that saw Celtic convert every one of their attempts on target bar two.It followed a decent half hour for the Dons that included a great chance for Chris Maguire.The game was of the freakish type that beset a far better Dons side at MacDiarmid Park under Alex Smith for example.Paul Hartley knows that he let his new club down but to criticize our skipper would be churlish in the extreme, given what he has already contributed to the cause.It was a miserable afternoon that will have been incredibly welcome for Doogie McDonald, the debacle temporarily removing the untruthful official from the media glare.The heavy loss understandably made Tuesday night’s Inverness clash take on extra importance but Aberdeen’s luck was totally out.If anyone thinks any of the Dons players didn’t give % against ICT they don’t know football.Watching the game upon getting home from the match you actually started believing that the Dons had to win, given the total dominance in the second half.Inverness took the lead due to simulation of the most repulsive type.The poor referee had a night to forget from beginning to end and the last thing he needed was players feigning and faking.The farcical penalty only served to double the Dons’ resolve.First half additional time was measured at two minutes which means that no injury time was played once factoring in the four yellows that had been flashed in the first period.The second half saw the passing and movement back to what we were enjoying back in August and the goal from Velicka was a belter, sent on his way by the best player of the field by a country mile – Scottie Vernon.The ref was given the chance to correct his penalty howler by awarding one to the home team but one assumes he must have been unsighted for the blatant hand-ball.The Inverness winner came from a free-kick that never was at the half way line, poor defending but rough, rough justice on a Dons team that gave everything.There was still time for Foran to try and get Ifil sent off and the game’s close saw the classless Butcher provocatively gesticulating in front of the RDS, doubly stupid given the pressure on a fellow boss. Mark McGhee was bullish and quite excellent in his post-match interviews on Tuesday.I do hope that the board hold their nerve and properly take into account the budget they have forced their employee to work with and by definition the worryingly youthful squad that has resulted.Standing good for a manageable debt is fine and dandy but more and more fans are scratching their heads and querying why fantastically rich iniduals are involvedthey have no intention of investing in the area’s only senior football club.Someone called the new ground ‘a vanity stadium’ this week and that is a brilliant description.Great rationale, lousy location.It’s taken the focus off the football.Mark McGhee will undoubtedly question his own decisions and soul search to get things right at a football club he loves but the great and good need to do likewise.The Dons are on the cusp of a very exciting team in the next couple of seasons but onlyeveryone in the Dons family sticks together.Celtic’s Anti-Poppy ShameGlasgow Celtic were said to be embarrassed and angered by sections of their support unfurling ious disgraceful banners on Saturday.The club, who has had issues at this time of the year before, ironically has since enjoyed warm plaudits for the swtness of their ‘condemnation’.Talk of bans has ensued, but you will forgive mewe file this under ‘Old Firm Lip Service’.British Heavyweights No boxing fan would ever claim to have Harrison or Haye anywhere near the all-time British greats type description, but I can’t help but be sucked into the intrigue as the two Brits go toe-to-toe on Saturday night.Many a sneaky tenner will be placed on Harrison to spring a surprise.Haye will need to take care of business as soon as possible as even Lennox Lewis was twice undone by random rogue punches – something always on the radar in this ision.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Driven by my interest in social and environmental justice, I have been pleased to secure a number of concessions and legislative changes to improve the lives of people in the region.“At this time, I’m focused on working with others to secure the passage of my Member’s Bill giving children equal protection from assault and hope to see it become law in the near future.“The Climate Emergency our planet is facing means that, more than ever, Green policies are required. I know there are others who can ensure they are promoted, and delivered, for my home, the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

Christ, how many times  IT’S RAPE, you troglodytes.However discomfiting these examples may be, they have nothing on the disingenuous coverage of Boris Johnson’s encounters with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. I mean, we could all see him sitting beside Merkel as protesters screamed “Liar” and “Stop Brexit” we could all see him stick his feet up on Macron’s side table like a self-entitled brat .The most inexperienced of analysts would have understood that turning up in Berlin with bluster and braggadocio, but no actual plan B was hardly a masterstroke and that Merkel and Macron’s agreement to give him a month to come up with aalternative was just a tactic to keep him occupied while they get on with important affairs of state.And yet the Express and the– cheerleaders for the worst Prime Minister in history – presented his bilateral talks as a triumph. The Express carried a photo of him raising his arms behind a fence with the headline “Brexit Victory Salute”, ashe were Winston Churchill giving his “Finest Hour” speech rather than a floppy-haired fop back from a European jolly. Thewent with the headline “Johnson Demands Fresh Border Plan”while columnists lined up to explain how he had seen off Macron’s attempts to intimidate him and had reset the EU negotiations. Neither paper pointed out that Macron reiterated that the Irish backstop was “indispensable” and that this is the position they have held ever since Theresa May’s withdrawal deal was negotiated.Their spin – or as Byrne would doubtless prefer us to frame it, “lie” – would be troubling at the best of times but as we are hurtling towards a No Deal, it is utterly irresponsible. At a time when journalists should be pointing out the perils of his misplaced ebullience, many are egging him on, feeding his self-delusion.In her MacTaggart Lecture, Byrne called out the inadequacy of much of our current news coverage and scrutinised some of the reasons for it. She blamed our contemporary leaders – May, Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn – for refusing to submit themselves to scrutiny as previous leaders including Margaret Thatcher did, and went on to compare the way Johnson does his own pieces to camera as Vladimir Putin-style politics.But she also castigated news organisations for believing audiences no longer crave forensic investigations and for talking down to young people. Citing Carole Cadwalladr’s Facebook Cambridge Analytica investigation and the popularity of hard-hitting podcasts, she said there was still an appetite for in-depth exposés, although she didn’t point out that they require resources as well as courage – and that such resources are not widely available.Finally, Byrne talked fearlessly about the need for more ersity: for more women, certainly but much more pressingly for more BAME employees. Although she rejected the phrase “pale, male and stale”, pointing out that many middle-aged white men make excellent programmes, she said TV made by a clique of posh boys was never going to challenge the status quo. “When you change who is making TV, you change TV,” she said.Much of what Byrne raised, we see in action every day the cabal of male presenters who revel in their outmoded attitudes . And the courting of a younger demographic with nattily-dressed presenters, bite-sized news items and YouTube influencers when what many of those who are politically engaged want is to be confronted with new perspectives on giant issues such as climate change. There are exceptions, of course: Jon Snow stands out as a journalist willing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy, and Five Live journalist Emma Barnett has earned a reputation for skewering political interviewees.But time and time again, especially in  shows and radio phone-ins, broadcasters yield to the demand of  balance, treating journalism as a stand-off between two opposing sides rather than a quest for truth. Nor is BBC Scotland immune to these problems though much of the new channel’s output has been admirable, it is still overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, The Nine has twice invited alt-right mouthpiece Brendan O’Neill to spout his anti-scientic climate change-denying views. Shouldn’t we be better than this As the spectre of a no-deal Brexit casts its increasingly dark shadow, there does appear to be a collective raising of the game. Over the past week or so, the BBC has been running a series of news packages analysing what a no-deal Brexit might mean in terms of the supply of fuel and medicine and the slaughter of animals that can no longer be exported.But as Byrne says, whatever happens with Brexit, our country is undergoing seismic changes and our broadcasters must do much morethey are to play a crucial role in holding those responsible to account. “We must find courage in this time of crisis,” the Scot said. “We must unite to use the power of television to protect democracy because it is being seriously undermined.” The following day, the Express gave its default response, which was to refer to “an online backlash” invisible to all but them.As Johnson engages in some pre-US trade talk willy-waving – insisting he will tell the US president “the NHS is not on the table” – Byrne’s rallying cry could not be more relevant. As men who couldn’t be trusted to tie their own shoelaces set the global agenda, the public is being failed. We need journalists to be less cowed. But we also need broadcasting companies to be willing to take risks, and newspaper owners to be interested in the actual news. And we need this to happen sooner rather than later. Because the hour of reckoning is nigh.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"solidarity not subsidy underpins union between scotland and england brian monteith","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Politicians should nurture ties among people that have more in common than drives them apart, writes Brian MonteithScottish unionists who bang on about a union idend are playing a very dangerous game, one that risks playing directly into nationalist hands and leaving them without arguments for remaining in the United Kingdom.Last week we had the annual announcement of the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandfigures and with it the usual claims and counter claims by unionists and nationalists seeking to gain partisan advantage from the data provided. Please note before I go any further that the information is released by the Scottish Government it is prepared by its own statisticians and carries with it the First Minister’s seal of approval, even though she could not be bothered to give this key publication the time of day. Over the years the methodology has been refined to take account of any possible gaps in the information presented, while politically motivated hoaxes, such as the whisky export tax, or “missing” allocations of public spending projects like Crossrail and HS have been debunked. Importantly, allowance is also made for looking at the figures with or without tax revenues from oil and gas production.The essential finding was that for the period of - Scotland had a public sector deficit of £. billion, slightly down on the year before. Average tax revenue per head was demonstrated to be £ lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, while spending per head has climbed to £,. Put together, these two figures define the fiscal transfer of £, per man woman and child that takes place seamlessly between the UK Treasury and the Scottish Government, including apportioned UK spending for defence and other mutual services Scotland benefits from.By themselves the GERS figures cannot and do not sayan independent Scotland could be economically sustainable. What they tell us is where the likely starting point would be were we to decide to leave the UK, before any changes could be made in Scottish government policy to alter the existing landscape. There would be notional Scottish spending of £.bn supported by an income of only £.bn – giving the estimated deficit of £.bn. Against Scotland’s Gross Domestic Productthe deficit was  per cent, compared to a deficit of . per cent for the UK. To put this in context Scotland would have the largest deficit as a share of GDP in the developed world, certainly the worst in Europe and way beyond the EU’s guideline limit of  per cent for its members.Taking account of the regional figures available via the UK’s Office of National Statistics there can be no doubt that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland provide a deficit against England’s surplus that leaves the whole UK in deficit, albeit reducing. Given the foregoing, Scotland’s receipt of this fiscal transfer is obviously not unique, indeed within England itself the tax revenues from the three regions of London, the South East and East notionally transfer to support all the other English regions, including the North West, North East, Yorkshire and West Midlands.This is the nature of fiscal transfers, where economically prosperous nations or regions fund a pool that is used to support those parts of the UK that are enduring harder times. Contributions and withdrawals to and from this pool will y over time, with some requiring help one year – or even decades – while at other times being the source of community municence.It is dangerous to justy participation in a country purely on economic terms while ignoring the greater historical, social and cultural bonds or strategic interests that make an entity greater than the sum of its parts. It is a good thing that when oil revenues collapsed the UK was able to ensure there was no catastrophic impact on Scottish public finances – as there would have beenScotland had voted for independence in . It is not a good thing for Scotland to run a large deficit and be reliant on the UK to make that forever possible.To justy Scotland’s place in the UK because it receives a “union idend” of nearly £, per person is like accelerating towards a blind summit, unaware of the hard landing that awaits politically.If unionists rely upon a figure to define the union idend then they must accept that correspondingly there will in some years be a union premium – a time when Scotland’s allocated tax revenues are greater than the spending it makes. Personally, I think this is a good thing, for it is what the union idend is really all about. It is a process, not a number a process that is built upon British solidarity, a shared experience of helping each other in times of great need from our hardest endeavours, creative genius or even just fortunate bounty.Indeed we can see from the official figures over the last  years that there have been times when Scotland has contributed to the maintenance of the UK and others when it has itself been supported. Since  Scotland has contributed a net £bn to the UK in real terms – a figure that shall undoubtedly be cancelled out by next year’s GERS figures. I know it is hard to imagine at a time when the SNP Scottish Government demonstrates with impressive regularity its ability to miscalculate it own economic forecasts and deliver poorer results in too many sections of the pubic services year-on-year – but the deficit could eventually change were the politicians to alter their centralising and incompetent ways.The private sector of the Scottish economy does relatively well despite the Scottish Government, rather than because of it. It could, with a change towards lower taxes and fewer regulations, achieve greater results and therefore contribute higher revenues while spending is restrained. When that day comes where stands the argument about the union idendit is measured by price alone How then will the argument fare that we should remain in the UK because of the Union Dividend when the GERS figures allow the SNP to complain about a similarly ridiculous “Union Premium”  Unionist politicians should stop focussing on the number and start concentrating on the shared benefits of giving and receiving help amongst people that have more in common than drives them apart. They should instead talk about how the deficit is reduced and how Scotland can help the weaker parts of the Union just as we have been helped when we needed it.Brian Monteith MEP is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"opposition parties settle on legislation to block no deal brexit","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corby hosted fellow opposition chiefs including the SNPs Ian Blackford and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson for an hour of talks in his Westminster office, which Mr Blackford described as ldquopositive and productive.window.twttr The decision to pursue legislation that will seize control of the parliamentary agenda - allowing MPs to rule out a no-deal and potentially delay the UKs  October Brexit deadline - represents an admission by Labour that there isnt sufficient support to force a no-confidence vote and install Mr Corbyn as a caretaker Prime Minister.: Jeremy Corbyn insists Labour will do everything necessary to halt no-deal BrexitIt also means concrete action to stop a no-deal could take place as soon as MPsfrom the summer recess, on  September.In a joint statement, the leaders of Labour the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Independent Group for Change said they had \"detailed\" discussions, including hearing legal advice from Labours shadow Attorney General Shami Charkabarti that calls a threat to suspend parliament in order to force through a no-deal \"the gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK Constitutional principle in living memory\".

Thousands of people are expected to be asked to get involved before the quota of members is reached.They will be tasked with finding answers to questions such as how Scotland can \"overcome the challenges we face, including those arising from Brexit \" and \"what kind of country are we seeking to build \"However the Assembly has already faced opposition from the Scottish Tories who have described it as a \"talking shop for independence\" while Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats has labelled it \"an attempt to sew some new patches on the SNPs dodgy case for independence.\"It has also been embroiled in controversy after SNP MP Joanna Cherry declared it the \"perfect way\" to move Scotland towards independence, and pollster Mark Dfley - who runs a polling company with former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson - was revealed as the person who won the £, contract to select the Assembly members.Mr Martin - who lost his European Parliament seat earlier this year - said the lack of participation by the two parties \"makes no dference because this is not a forum for political parties, it makes no dference to theof the Assembly\" but he stressed \"they would be foolish to turn their heads away.\"Almost one in five of participants -were successful in recruitment - will be historic Conservative voters and Im not sure how they would feel about their party to say were having nothing to do with this.\"His co-convener Kate Wimpress added: \"That perception is out there but I would point to the recruitment framework - that undercuts that assumption. People will be giving of their time, engaging in this debate, it would be foolhardy to ignore that.\"She added: \"I sincerely hope people will see this as a positive chance to look at some of the important issues that are facing us all, in a supported space, where we can look at the complexities of the world and step away from the binary is it this or that  Its an opportunity. I genuinely hope people will see it as that.\"However Adam Tomkins, Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman, doubled down on his partys opposition to the Assembly, and said it will \"never be viewed as impartial\".He said: “As we’ve just seen with the GERS figures, the SNP will contort anything to try and support their separatist agenda. The SNP believes the constitution is the most important priority but the majority of Scots simply want the Scottish Government to tackle our worsening education system, worst ever hospital waiting lists, crumbling roads and faulty children’s hospital.“If this Assembly is considering options to improve Scotland’s future why aren’t they considering health, education or climate change  The simple fact is that the SNP’s destruction of our economy and public services are the biggest threats to the successful future of Scotland.”The Assembly conveners also stressed that the topics for debate would be led by the members, and that there would be no discussion on an independence referendum.Mr Martin said: \"The government has made a decision to ask for a Section  order, thats not for us to debate. Its not for us to come to a conclusion on independence, or devo max, or even going back to a unitary state. The Assembly will look at topics, for instance it might want to look at immigration and the impact of Brexit on that, and take evidence and come to a conclusion.\"The selection of participants will see  per cent of members drawn from the Lothians,  per cent from north east Scotland,  per cent from Glasgow, a further  per cent from the west of Scotland and an equal percentage from the south of Scotland,  per cent form Mid Scotland and Fe and Central Scotland and eight per cent from the Highlands and Islands.In terms of age the largest cohort at  per cent will be from the  to  years-old bracket, and there will be more women than men, with percentages of  per cent to  per cent.Around  per cent of members will be of white ethnicity, there will be quota targets for those with disabilities and mental health issues, and in terms of qualications, the vast majority -  per cent - will be educated to secondary school Standard and Higher grades, with just  per cent having degrees, and  per cent expected to have no qualications.Politically the Assembly will be \"broadly balanced\", using the average percentages from opinion polls over the last  months, so  per cent will be SNP voters,  per cent Conservative voters,  per cent Labour, six per cent Liberal Democrat and four per cent Green voters. Undecideds and even those who wouldnt vote in a Scottish Parliament election will be represented.And in terms of voting intentions in any Scottish independence referendum, the Assembly will consist of  per cent of No voters, and  per cent Yes, with the rest being made up of dont knows and those would not vote.There has been no estimated cost of running the Assembly yet given - and yesterday it was revealed that no criminal checks will be carried out on participants as the organisers have no legal remit to do so.Each participant will be expected to attend six weekend residential meetings, which start in October, receiving £ for each session plus expenses, and help with childcare or caring duties - which could see the bill for participants top £,. Already the bill for consultants has reportedly hit £,.Ian Davidson, a civil servant seconded to act as the Assemblys secretariat, said they were not authorised to use the official disclosure checks on criminal records.He added: \"There are certain limitations on the extent to which we can investigate members of the Assembly. They will be required to sign up to a code of conduct.

Eastern said this was so it would be “wholly compliant and in control of the operation”.The substitution involved an empty Embraer  jet being flown some  miles from Humberside airport to Norwich to pick up the Royal party and regular passengers.Loganair’s own Embraer plane then also flew empty some  miles from Norwich to Aberdeen so it could operate the next flight back to Norwich.The Glasgow airline has been subcontracted by Eastern since February for weekday flights on the route.The source said: “An Eastern Airways jet was flown empty from Humberside to Norwich and then flew the scheduled flight to Aberdeen with the Royals on board.• : William and Kate catch budget £ FlyBe flight to Scotland with royal children“The Loganair aircraft which normally flies this route for Flybe and Eastern flew from Aberdeen to Norwich as usual but then flew empty from Norwich to Aberdeen.“I guess it was to ensurethey had any Press coverage of the Royal travel, an aircraft with a Flybe logo flew them.“Heck of a carbon footprint to achieve it – not exactly environmentally conscious.”Royal author Phil Dampier had said: “The contrast between William, Kate and family travelling on a budget flight to Scotland and Harry and Meghan using private jets couldn’t be starker.“At the very least they know they would have been criticisedthey had taken a private jet.”Flybe said the decision to change the aircraft had been Eastern’s.

He also reacted angrily to the news that Mr Goodlad could not be in attendance, shaking his head as Mr Halcro Johnston explained his absence.SNP candidate Tom Wills began by saying that #Shetland is ready for a change# and asked for  months to show what he can achieve in Holyrood, while Lib Dem competitor Beatrice Wishart opened her speech with a defiant message: #If you want an MSP who will speak up for Shetland, I’m your woman#.The first question of the night revolved around transport, with Ms Wishart and Mr Wills clashing immediately, interrupting each other#s answers as Mr Johnston appealed for both candidates to let the other finish.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to Mr Wills# five-point transport plan by saying that #Tom Wills has a load of great ideas but they won’t be delivered#, while independent candidate Ryan Thomson added that #nothing gets done” because “Shetland is the pawn” in mainland politics.Councillor George Smith directed a question at Mr Wills, asking him how he expected the SIC to afford one of his election pledges, free foot passengers on inter-island ferries.Mr Wills responded to say that this could be paid for #, and when# the Scottish government provided additional funding to the council.Mr Thomson criticised the NorthLink ferries in response to a question about increased capacity on the ferries.

Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be £. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about £ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some £ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about £ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of £. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron’s government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.Had it not been for the global economic crisis, and Blair#s US led wars, Brown#s finances could have seen him becoming PM. This shows the harm in getting too friendly with the US, not that there will be much of a choice for the remnants of the UK after Brexit. I won#t digny John M Scott#s final comment with a response other than to note that it is Trump and Farage that have been too close to white supremacists.

The first question comes from secondary five pupil Scott Moncrieff who asks whether, after  years, the time has come for Shetland to back a party other than the Liberals.Lib Dem candidate Beatrice Wishart is the first to answer. She reflects on the party#s -year record in the isles.SNP hopeful Tom Wills says that it#s #not healthy# for a constituency to be represented by the same party for seven decades. Independent Ian Scott, standing on an anti-austerity ticket, is straight on the offensive. He says the Lib Dems have a #hugely checkered career# and references the party#s decision to go into coalition with the Tories under Nick Clegg.North Isles councillor Ryan Thomson tells the room that #the status quo is not working# and agrees with the questioner and other candidates that the time has come for change. The next question comes from Drew Manson, who asks why the SNP should be trusted. He says they #say one thing then do another# and accuses the party of broken promises over ferry funding.Mr Wills replies that the nationalists have increased funding by £ million one year, followed by . million the next. He argues that this is a #good news story that is getting better#.The candidates are now debating whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a #statesman or a bad comedian#. Green candidate Debra Nicolson believes he #is very dangerous# and states that the £ million a week for the NHS pledge, made during the Brexit referendum campaign, was a lie. Labour#s Johan Adamson says Mr Johnson is guilty of #complete fabrications# and says that he has charted a #reckless path# for the UK as he drags the country towards a no-deal Brexit. Mr Wills compares the Prime Minister to US President Donald Trump. He says the personality is a #distraction from what#s going on behind the scenes which is right-wing populism#. Brexit was won #on a pack of lies# he adds. The SNP candidate draws the first applause of the hustings for saying that the Lib Dem and Tory coalition made the poorest in society suffer for the #errors of the bankers# following the  financial crisis.It#s dficult to hear Ms Wishart from the back of the room here. It sounds like she says she is #not impressed# with Mr Johnson.Independent Ryan Thomson, meanwhile, goes in hard, calling the PM a #racist, liar and a xenophobe# and says that the fact he rose the highest office in the land shows #exactly what#s wrong with politics in this country#. Mr Scott says Mr Johnson is a #loathsome creature who leads a loathsome party#.#They have no respect for us. They have no interest in how we live.#He adds Tory austerity drove people into the arms of #fascists# like Nigel Farage and says the Lib Dem and Tory coalition has a lot to answer for. A smattering of applause follows Mr Scott#s assertion that the Lib Dems would happily get back into bed with the Tories#Boris comes knocking#. Groans after Mr Halcro Johnston attempts to defend Mr Johnson#s comments on Muslim women and black people with #watermelon smiles#. Almost universal applause for Mr Thomson as he takes down Mr Halcro Johnston#s argument and adds that Mr Johnson was sacked as a journalist for lying. The candidates are now discussing Scottish independence.Mr Wills says #nobody will be surprised# to learn that he thinks the time has come for another referendum on the issue. This comes after MP Alistair Carmichael accused the SNP of avoiding mentions of independence during the by-election campaign. Ms Wishart says voters were told in  that the referendum was called a #once in a letime# vote. Chair Irvine Tait says voters were told independence would mean an exit from the EU. He asks whether that entitles people in Scotland, faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, to another chance to vote. Ms Wishart#s response is dficult to hear.Independent Michael Stout, meanwhile, says that he backed independence in . Mr Scott says #self-determination is an essential tenet# of a democracy. He says there is a dference between independence and nationalism. #You belief the politicians at your peril#, he adds, drawing a few chuckles.Mrs Adamson says that Scotland should stay in the UK to #make it better#. #It#s an international world, why are we being so selfish #Mr Wills has taken notes on several anti-SNP points made by spectators. Responding to concerns over an independent Scotland#s wealth he argues that Scotland#s GDP is the same, per capita, as the rest of the UK without even factoring in oil wealth. Mr Thomson says that it is not the right time for a second independence referendum. #The SNP is basing it#s new push for independence on Brexit but Brexit hasn#t happened yet#, he says. Final question # should pupils go on strike to protest climate change Ms Nicolson, unsurprisingly, says #absolutely#. #It#s your future#, she tells the room, adding that the Scottish Greens are #right behind you#.Mr Halco Johnston says #yes and no#.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

With over thirty years experience in the field, he has been the head chef, first manager and then owner of the popular The Side Door restaurant, located at Febro Buildings on the Antrim Road in Glengormley for  years.Brendan grew up on the Cltonville Road until he was  years old when his parents moved to the Antrim Road. His first part-time job came in the old Lansdowne Court as it was known back in the day.Ever since a young age, Brendan was interested in the food and catering industry and decided to pursue a career in the field when he left school at . After three years at the College of Business in Brunswick Street in Belfast, he went on to complete a B-Tech qualication and an advanced catering course.Subsequent employment followed in the shape of a full-time role in the Lansdowne before spells in Belfast Castle, the Crawfordsburn Inn and Chimney Corner.But it is with his current venture The Side Door that he has made his name, establishing the -seater restaurant ever since taking over six years ago as the new owner.Brendan explained: “The Side Door is basically a family-style restaurant with something on the menu for everyone. The menu is very mainstream.“The previous owner’s menu was something close to fine dining but people were still ordering pizzas. I thought it wasn’t right so I changed the menu about a bit.“I had my own ideas and kept it mainstream to attract anybody and everybody.“The pressure was there to get bums on seats and it has worked ever since so I have no intention of changing it.”Brendan also acts as Head Chef at The Side Door and thanks to his wealth of experience, he has put his own style and spin on food.“I would cook things like lasagne, carbonara, scampi and burgers,” he added.“Everything is home-made. I am experienced enough to know what way things are cooked best and what sells well.“I used to be a sauce chef and I suppose sauces and soups are still my forte.It is still probably my favourite aspect of being in the kitchen.“I was brought up in the catering industry on a French theme which is something I still like doing, especially with some of the specials in the restaurant in some shape or form.”As for how things have changed in the industry, Brendan points to a number of ious things he has noticed over the years.“The food industry has changed massively over the years,” he explained.“Themes and customers needs and wants are like night and day now since when I started off over  years ago.“Food takes waves now, much like politics. whether Italian or Mexican themed.“There are more vegans and vegetarians than ever before but allergies is such a big thing these days. Celiac is definitely the main one and you just have to be so careful.“I probably wouldn’t have taken as much of an interest in allergies but when I found out my daughter had a nut allergy, it changed everything. It scared me.”Looking ahead to the future, Brendan reflected on what he has achieved so far at The Side Door.“Glengormley is a perfect setting. People thought I was mad taking The Side Door on with the amount of competition but my idea wasyou want to buy a washing machine and there is more than one shop available in the same area to buy it, you will still compare it, just like restaurants.“I think we stand out because we are not pretentious. Many restaurants are, in my opinion. We are not – what you see is what you get: fresh food bought from a number of dferent suppliers who I have built up a relationship with over the years. I buy the best produce that I can get but at affordable prices for customers.“I believe also in good service and to my knowledge, we are still the only bring-your-own restaurant in Glengormley.“As for the future, I am not getting any younger. I thought around two years ago about looking for a bigger premises. What I have to turn away from a Thursday to a Sunday now is scary some weeks, but I thought here was working. I decided to stay because things are good and long may it continue.“Customers keep coming back so I must be doing something right.”Brendan Rafferty is Owner, Manager and Head Chef at The Side Door restaurant in Glengormley.The Side Door,Febro Buildings,Ballyclare Road,Glengormley,BT DZ.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"speckled hen have got it well sussed","story":"IN a food market dominated by commercial farming, big drinks brands and unormity, the authenticity and quality yielded by do-it yourself approach is becoming all the more appealing, and there are few businesses doing it better locally than the Speckled Hen Bar and Dining Rooms.Having long brewed an exciting range of its own craft beers and ciders, the Lisburn-based establishment has taken the next crucial step towards self-suffiency by bottling its own still and sparkled water. Although a seemingly simple step, tapping into the natural springs below the bar has revealed interesting information about the geography of the area and, as owner Martin Caldwell explains, has created further links to the Speckled Hen’s -year history.“Right under our feet is the Triassic Aquer, which stretches from the Castlereagh to Black Mountain,” he said.“There has always been a well under the bar, so given that we’re filtering our own water anyway, it made sense to put in a chiller, a cooler and a carbonator to make fizzy water too.“There was originally a well there and the previous owner had tapped into it. During the winter time you can actually see little springs coming up out in the carpark. There used to be a well where our beer garden is now where they used to dip the buckets for water. The pub goes back to , so it goes back a fair while. They used to brew their own beers and everything here, so access to spring water was vital.”He continued: “It’s fantastic that a place of this age is still ing and providing hospitality and services. This used to be the old post road and was also one of the main roads to Dublin at the time, so coaches used to stop along here. It was actually alleged that Daniel O’Connell stopped here before. It would have had to have been self-sufficient. We’re essentially going back to the notion of our own self-sufficiency in terms of the supply of water as well.”The Speckled Hen started bottling its water last month, installing a new filtration system that provides fresh four-times-filtered water for its customers. The water is, of course, filtered through the rocks on its journey across the mountains that, according to Queen’s University researchers, began , to , years ago. As for the punters, Martin says they see it as a “great novelty”.“They’re getting their draft beer and now they are getting draft water, he said.“The kids come in and want cordials or juices, so now well ask themthey want still or fizzy water – they think it’s a great novelty getting the fizzy water in the cordial.”While making connections with the pub’s past, Martin and his team are also looking to the future with the installation of farming allotments that will provide fruit, veg and more for it’s kitchens in the years to come."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its funds for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Fast food restaurant City Picnic closed on the day of the fire and hasnt been opened since, though hopes to be open again by the autumn. Others such as Pizza Boutique struggled on for a time after the cordon was reduced, only to also shutter their premises completely.Primark opened two stores, one at the back of its Bank Buildings shop and another on Donegall Place - though it is also planning a restoration of Bank Buildings. Fashion chain Zara was closed for around seven months, thanks to its close proximity to Bank Buildings.Mr Rana said the first impact had been to galvanise organisations in the city to work together with a greater sense of urgency than ever before. \"There was Belfast City Council, then ourselves in the Chamber, then the other business-type organisations like Belfast City Centre Management and also the Department for Communities, and Translink.\"It did throw us together and resulted in a great deal of co-ordination and co-working. Its probably strengthened that relationship and added impetus to work together.\"That led to initiatives to draw people into the city centre around Christmas, such as a winter-themed slide in Royal Avenue and stalls selling fast food. And a kids play park was also installed in Castle Place.Mr Rana said: \"The animation that the council provided in the peak Christmas season meant the city was very busy, and that did attract people into the city that probably hadnt been in recently. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  Aerial view over Bank Buildings following Tuesdays fire.

Discussions are taking place, too, about pedestrianisation and improving public transport into and around the city. Mr Rana - whose company Andras House owns a string of hotels in the city - said the crisis of the fire had led to creative thinking. \"I would say it did stimulate new ideas to try things, which dont always work but its good to try them. \"It certainly has highlighted the importance of the city centre. When it wasnt ing we all really felt it.\"He said retail was the biggest pull into the city centre, but that the night-time economy and the drive to get more people living in it were also a big part of planning its future. And he said retail in Belfast centre - despite the well-publicised dficulties of the sector as a whole - was performing well.\"Weve had a new store, Anthropologie, opening in Arthur Street two Primark shops opening and CastleCourt Shopping Centre has a new Matalan, which does very well. \"And in Belfast, we still have our big-brand retailers like House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks  Spencer - retailers which have closed stores in other city centres.\"And he said other parts of the city centre were being redeveloped, such as a site close to Smithfield Market and the Tribeca development around the Cathedral Quarter. The Tribeca name has attracted objections as its also the name of a district in New York. But Mr Rana said he did not object to the name. \"The name gives definition to the area and at the end of the day, the priority isnt the name but making sure development starts, proceeds and benefits the city centre.\""},{"url":null,"title":"long distance swimmer thanks belfast medics who saved his life","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_aeecb-de-bdd--fab_EmailThe th anniversary of the bombing that killed Lord Mountbatten and three others serves as a stark reminder of dark days no one wants to , a service for the victims has been told..pushThe commemoration of the fishing boat blast that killed the Queen’s second cousin, two members of his family and a local boat boy should be used to rededicate people to the causes of reconciliation and justice, a cleric said.Church of Ireland Archdeacon Isaac Hanna told those gathered on a rainswept clftop just outside the seaside village of Mullaghmore, Co Sligo, that no family should again have to experience the trauma endured by those bereaved by the IRA attack in August .The parents of Paul Maxwell, the Co Fermanagh teenager who was working on the boat when it blew up, were among those who came to remember  years on.John Maxwell and Mary Hornsey, sitting either side of their daughter Lisa McKean, listened as Archdeacon Hanna spoke of a day when “innocence was lost”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mary Hornsey, Lisa McKean and John Maxwell Rescuers and medics who responded to the incident joined them, as did former staff of Classiebawn Castle, the holiday home where Lord Mountbatten stayed on his frequent fishing trips to Ireland.As well as killing the great uncle and mentor of Prince Charles and -year-old schoolboy Paul, the bomb on the Shadow V also claimed the lives of Lady Doreen Brabourne, the -year-old mother-in-law of Lord Mountbatten’s daughter, and his -year-old grandson Nicholas Knatchbull.During the service, John Maxwell read verses from Seamus Heaney’s Cure At Troy.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  John Maxwell reads a verse by Seamus Heaney “So hope for a great sea-change on the far side of revenge,” he said. “Believe that a further shore is reachable from here.”He then joined Paul’s mother to lay a wreath at the simple green cross memorial overlooking the waves of the Atlantic Ocean.Ms Hornsey later placed a single yellow rose on a plaque dedicated to the victims, kissing the flower before letting go.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mary Hornsey lays a yellow rose at the memorial cross Archdeacon Hanna, who was joined by parish priest Tom Hever for the cross-community service, told the gathering that the people of Mullaghmore stood with the bereaved.“The events of  years ago are hard to imagine as we look out over this scene,” he said, as Paul’s parents listened from the front row.“And yet they speak of innocence lost, they speak of a time when horror visited this coastline and this place, they speak of a time of confusion and fear.“I also want to say they speak of a time when a community rallied around those that had lost loved ones, when this community stood with this family in particular and all those who had been affected in some way, and said, ‘this was not done in our name’.“We stand with you and there is comfort and strength in knowing that you have this support in this place at this time.”Fear can have a stling effect on those who are coerced and are intimidated in any way, and perhaps that was the intention that day, but the opposite has been the effectArchdeacon Isaac HannaThe archdeacon said the bombers had not succeededtheir goal was to strike fear into people.“Fear can have a stling effect on those who are coerced and are intimidated in any way, and perhaps that was the intention that day, but the opposite has been the effect,” he said.“Today is as much about rededicating ourselves to the cause of justice, the cause of reconciliation and the cause of freedom so that no person should have to go through what you as a group have gone through.”Afterwards, Ms Hornsey said the service had been of great comfort to the family.“I think it was absolutely wonderful that the community came out today and organised this lovely service of remembrance,” she said.“I would like to say thank you to all of those people who took part in this.“It has helped us enormously because I feel that in this service there was love and support for our family and we appreciate that.“I feel really privileged to be here with all these people, to hear their singing and their words of comfort, and to meet people who had actually been here on that day.“A friend of Paul’s who is now , Paul and this friend Matty, they were best friends, he has never had anotherfriend since Paul died, so hearing all that and meeting old friends and people I have not seen who were actually here on the day of the explosion has meant a great deal because of their love and support, and the people of Mullaghmore have been absolutely wonderful.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

He fired one shot straight at the lsquokeeper, one went wide and a cross which narrowly evaded everyone in the box.Killyleagh did prove menacing and in the th minute nice link up play between Charlie Holland and Darren McConnell allowed him to release Jamie Sharvin, but he hot straight at lsquokeeper, Mark Hynes.Thomas Healy was next up for the Whites in the th minute. John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson. However, his driven shot ended safely in the arms of YC goalkeeper Aaron Carberry.The visitors then had their best chance of the half in the th minute. Neale did well to hold off a defender and release Healy on the edge of the box, but his shot was fired just over.Both teams changed formations in the second half and Rosario really started to create some great opportunities.The game sprang into le when Johnson was put through one-on-one with Carberry, but once again the lsquokeeper stood up and made a smart save, with Murray missing the rebound.In the th minute Rosario were awarded a penalty. A long ball over the top caught the Killyleagh defence out with John Murray conceding a penalty and then seeing red in the resulting melee.Up stepped Ciaran Gillan, who struck a sweet penalty only to see it saved superbly by Carberry.In the th minute Killyleagh reminded Rosario that they were still in the game as Niall Walsh nodded a corner back into the path of Dylan Kelly who just couldnrsquot make contact with the goal at his mercy.It proved not the Gillanrsquos day.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick.

We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter.

Their unique wing structure along with their light weight enables them to go to places that other land-based mammals would find unmanageable. Their limbs are highly modied for flight, so they find it dficult to move around on the ground. When they are not flying, they rest hanging upside down from a tree branch using their sharp claws.Roosting in caves, trees or draught-free buildings each species has their own preferred roost, usually near its main food source. They eat insects including moths and midges, so are considered a very important natural pest controller. Echolocation aids their navigation when hunting for prey on the wing at night. Bats are creatures of habit, ing to their favourite roost each year..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Northern Ireland has eight species of bats, all protected by European law. Apart from being incredible little animals to watch, bats are a valuable part of nature across the UK and can be a very welcome visitor to our gardens. Sadly, though, they’re becoming increasingly rare in the UK. Like so many other animals, a gradual loss of habitat and roost sites are making numbers decline at an alarming rate. As old trees are cut down, buildings disturbed and mines filled in, bats are left with very few natural roost sites. Making sure our gardens are thriving insect-rich feeding grounds for bats can help a lot. And, just as we do with nestboxes for birds, we can also provide alternative roost sites for bats in the form of bat boxes. You can find out more information on how to help bats via our website . So while our Belfast Bat Walk is done for another year, we have another fantastic event taking place in Enniskillen in September. What better date for a ‘Bat Detectives’ guided walk than Friday the th  It’s a great opportunity to learn more about bats, to see and hear them and immerse yourself in their world. There will be a short introductory talk about bats followed by a night-time walk using bat detectors to identy the dferent species living in Enniskillen town centre. Tickets are £ per adult, £. per child and free for all RSPB members.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
