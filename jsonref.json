Biden created the first-ever White House Gender Policy Council last year to help promote gender equity throughout the administration. He said everyone deserves to live up to their “God-given” potential, regardless of gender, and that societies perform better when women and girls are allowed to prosper.  The White House also was hosting a livestreamed International Women’s Day event to discuss the announcement, featuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken from Europe, acting budget director Shalanda Young, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power and Jen Klein, director of the Gender Policy Council. They are to be joined by young women leaders from Ukraine, Brazil, Zambia, Burma, Jordan and the United States. Biden was not scheduled to participate. Jill Biden marked the day with a video tribute to women throughout the world “who courageously use their voice, no matter the cost.” According to the GEO “participating employers will run pilots aimed at closing salary gaps by publishing salaries on all job adverts” - no information on the press release about how many employers actually are participating (I have asked).  They are also pushing a new ‘returners’ programme to support women into STEM roles after taking time out after having kids or other caring responsibilities.  This new programme will, it says, “help organisations to recruit and retain talented staff who are often overlooked because of a gap on their CV, by providing training, development and employment support to those who have taken time out for caring.” There is not much detail in the GEO release on this though, including how many women it will help, and how it will be rolled out - and indeed how much money it will cost, and who is paying for it. If the GEO responds to my requests for further details I will report back. It’s simple. It’s effective. It’s oh so pleasing.  Here’s a selection of companies who really don’t have too much to shout about when it comes to pay equality, and yet are using IWD as a means of promotion.  Some companies seem to have gone as far as deleting their tweets once their gender pay gap has been pointed out to the world.  A whopping two-thirds of England and Wales’ leading clubs have ALL-MALE boards a study by the organisation found. YEP. ALL. MALE.  Because, sure, women don’t care about football right? (As someone who has suffered under the life-long affliction of being an Everton fan, I beg to differ).  Published today Fair Game found clubs to be “hugely naive” when it comes to catering for and marketing to female fans, and that they are missing out on vital revenue as a result. This comes after the Football Association reported in November that clubs and governing bodies signed up to the Football Leadership Diversity Code (FLDC) had collectively failed to hit any of the recruitment targets set related to women in the scheme’s first 10 months. FLDC targets to hire females in senior leadership, team operations and women’s club coaching roles were all missed. The Fair Game report notes that clubs are really missing a trick - as erse boards make for more financial success and better decision making. Duh.  Dr Stacey Pope, co-author of the report and an Associate Professor at Durham University, added:  As it notes: “femicide - the killing of women and girls because of their gender - is the most extreme form of gender-based violence, but in many countries no record is kept of the number of cases.” The BBC spoke to Gulsum Kav in Turkey, who began a campaign to stop femicide in 2010, the year after the dead body of a teenager, Munevver Karabulut, was found in a bin in Istanbul. It took police more than six months to track down the suspect, leading to protests on the streets of Istanbul. She and the We Will Stop Femicide Team also looked into the case of Esin Gunes, a young teacher whose body was found at the bottom of a cliff in Siirt province, south-eastern Turkey, in August 2010. Read the full story here. Here’s the gist of it: Touted as “the UK’s first education partnership of its kind” - the government is teaming up with the private sector to boost girls’ access to education, working in partnership with UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited (GenU) to help deliver the programme.  Businesses, charities, schools and colleges will be able to bid for funds from the programme, with a focus on providing the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills needed to find work in key sectors such as technology and manufacturing. Initially bids will be encouraged for projects in Nigeria and Bangladesh, two countries where significant barriers to girls’ education remain. I spoke to the new national police lead Maggie Blyth yesterday, just before she got on a flight to attend a IWD event in Dublin.  It was an interesting conversation, because unlike the former politan policer chief Cressida Dick Blyth was very candid about the extent of the problems with sexism and misogyny in the police force. She admitted that the police can attract some men who want to use the powers of being a police officer “to exert and coerce” vulnerable people - even while vehemently insisting that the vast majority of the force are horrified by the actions of some of those in their ranks.

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill Hot-water bottles for period pain, free slippers, a four-day week and free hugs are just some of the perks on offer at an all-women Irish company.Sisters Lesa Malone and Nora Morris lead a team of seven at their financial firm Brady Management Global Ltd and say they are inundated with requests from other women seeking to work in an office where messages of support are regularly left on colleagues desks.“It was never meant to be an all-women firm but it just happened that way,” said Lesa, who founded the Co Meath-based company with her sister in 2016.“Most of the staff were referred to us. Some are our daughters and daughters-in-law and others are friends or people they’ve worked with in the past. They just happen to be all women.”She added: “We have had men here on work placement in the past so we are by no means anti-men.” The company helps businesses with matters such as book-keeping and payroll and has clients in Ireland and the US, where it is seeking to expand. Due to Covid-19, staff were equipped to work from home but they all decided they wanted to return to the office.“We have hot-water bottles to ease any period pain. We have slippers for all the girls to keep cosy in winter and as we are aware of staff who are going through the menopause, we have fans at the ready to quell the hot flushes,” Lesa said.“The girls leave notes for each other all the time with messages of support. So if someone is at college one of the days, they’ll come back to find a note saying they hoped the classes went well and that they had a great day. That kind of thing.”Check-upsHaving seen their mother Bridget die at a young age from cancer, and having had their own health challenges, the sisters encourage staff to have regular check-ups. The company introduced a four-day working week in 2019 in order to ensure working mothers were not spending their weekends cleaning or food shopping.“It was something Lesa and I discussed pre-Covid because as working mothers, we found we were spending Saturday and Sunday cleaning the house or doing the laundry or the food shopping,” said Nora.“Having the Friday off means we can do all that and then have the weekends to ourselves. . . The girls are delighted. They do a few hours extra over the other four days and then have the longer weekend.”On International Women’s Day, Lesa and Nora insist that women need more flexibility in the workplace, especially if they have children, and their approach has made staff retention easy.“No one wants to leave,” said Nora. “Everyone tells us they are here to stay until they retire. And we are constantly asked by other women for a job.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics europe s turning point","story":"Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has brought about enormous changes in European policy in an incredibly short space of time.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos Russia has summoned the Irish ambassador in Moscow over the ramming of a truck into the gates of its embassy in Dublin on Monday.In a tweet posted on Tuesday afternoon, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had summoned Brian McElduff, the ambassador, and “demanded an official apology from the Irish leadership”. The account said Mr McElduff was “strongly protested in connection with the security incident,” according to a translation of its post generated by Twitter. Earlier on Tuesday, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar described the truck incident as “foolish and unhelpful”. Leo Varadkar said this action could be “misrepresented in Russian state TV as Irish people being involved in violent acts against Russians”. He said: “It may be the case that the person behind it had strong feelings on this issue, but it was not helpful at all because we have obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomats that are here in Ireland. So it was a foolish and unhelpful act that in that regard.”He said while people were entitled to protest, such protests should be peaceful with “no violence” and “no criminal damage”. Mr Varadkar said gardaí and the Department of Foreign Affairs had been in contact with the Russian Embassy following the incident and “are reviewing security to make sure that something like this doesn’t happen again.”The driver, Desmond Wisley (49), appeared in court on Tuesday morning in connection with the incident, charged with criminal damage and dangerous driving. Immediately after the incident on Monday the Russian Embassy accused the Government of violating international law for allowing the incident to happen, and claimed members of the Garda “stood idle” as the incident happened.In a follow-up statement, however, the embassy said: “We would like to inform that additional measures have been undertaken by the Garda to ensure safety and security of the embassy and its personnel. The embassy appreciates co-operation by the Irish authorities in this matter.”On Monday evening security barriers were erected to create a buffer between the embassy and protesters.Mr Varadkar also said that, politically, “the message to the Russian government and also the Russian people is very clear that ‘we’re on the side of Ukraine’.” The incident comes days after Russian ambassador Yury Filativ told Russian TV the situation in Ireland was “frankly difficult”. Mr Filativ accused the country of being to the forefront of “anti-Russian events” in the European Union.

Impounding the yachts of billionaire oligarchs is incidental to the true source of financing for Vladimir Putin’s war – energy exports.Last Friday, as rockets rained down on civilian areas, Shell stepped in to the market to buy a substantial quantity of Russian oil at a heavily discounted price. This was not in breach of the sanctions because they do not cover energy sales.Such was the obloquy heaped on Shell that it subsequently pledged to give any profits to a relief fund for Ukrainian refugees. The company said that, while it was appalled by the events in Ukraine, “we currently purchase it … to ensure that we continue the production of essential fuels and products that people and businesses rely on every day.” Herein lies the conundrum. People in the West are horrified by what is going on in Ukraine but how much disruption to their own lives are they prepared to put up with to demonstrate their concern?Shell was buying the oil to meet consumer demand in the absence of any other immediately available sources. It may be possible to find alternatives but it will take time, assuming other producers are ready to play ball. An embargo on Russian oil would have a massive knock-on impact on the global economy, not just Russia’s, as was apparent from the fall in global stock markets.To a great extent a de facto embargo is already in place since traders are largely shunning Russian crude. Shell bought at a heavily discounted price because the producers are struggling to offload it. As storage sites fill up, Russia will be forced to cut production with potentially calamitous consequences for its industry.On the markets, the price of a barrel is now at a 10-year high, which means bonanza revenues for Russia if it could sell the oil at spot prices. An embargo would make any such purchases unlawful and seriously harm Putin even if he were able to sell some to China. But there can be no pretence that it will not damage Western economies, though America is much less exposed than Europe, where there is little appetite for an embargo as was clear at the No 10 summit yesterday.The added danger is that such a move reinforces Putin’s domestic narrative that the West has ganged up on Russia. Death by a thousand cuts might be a better option.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sanctions will hit cost of living - but price of Putin victory would be far higher, warns Liz TrussRussia-Ukraine latest news: Two children among 21 dead in air strike on SumyLatest pictures from Ukraine: Refugee crisis grows as 2m flee warRoyals declare truce with The Crown as Camilla jokes with her Netflix ‘alter-ego’International Women\u0026#39s Day 2022: How it began and why the fight for women\u0026#39s rights is still necessaryUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as Putin tells mothers \u0026#39I understand your worry\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna lumley cancel culture ancestors did reprehensible things","story":"More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Two children among 21 dead in air strike on SumyRoyals declare truce with The Crown as Camilla jokes with her Netflix ‘alter-ego’Politics latest news: Ministry of Defence will step in to rescue chaotic Ukraine refugee scheme, reveals Ben WallaceInternational Women\u0026#39s Day 2022: How it began and why the fight for women\u0026#39s rights is still necessaryUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as Putin tells mothers \u0026#39I understand your worry\u0026#39New ‘pop-up’ UK visa site for Ukrainian refugees to be established in LilleMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin may stay power longer think","story":"Western sanctions on Vladimir Putin have gone far beyond what anyone thought likely and have had an immediate and profound impact, not just on the Russian economy but on the daily lives of millions. For Russia’s well-to-do middle classes and elites the party is already over, their savings devalued and their ability to travel internationally all but blocked. Even for the country’s working millions, Soviet-era austerity almost certainly awaits, given the scale of the economic war being waged against the country.But those hoping that sanctions will quickly topple Putin are mistaken, say experts. Popular uprisings of the sort that saw the Iron Curtain torn down need years to foment and, for the moment at least, 70 per cent of Russians support the war in Ukraine, according to official polls.Perhaps more surprising, the idea that the business and security elites who surround Putin will suddenly turn on him is also flawed, say Kremlinologists. Indeed, the financial storm they face could drive many closer to Putin.   “Being on the US sanctions list used to be a status symbol of patriotism. But now it’s a requirement. If you’re not on it, it’s suspicious,” a Russian state banker told the Financial Times last week.“The smart oligarchs get how things work here and the dumb ones aren’t oligarchs any more,” added a senior Kremlin official. “Everyone who doesn’t like it is out, or in prison.”Putin’s “winning coalition” roughly consists of two groups of elites: oligarchs and strongmen, says Prof Olga Chyzh, a political scientist and expert in autocratic regimes at the University of Toronto. Here’s a run down of the key groups and why they are unlikely to move against him – in the short term at least...Yeltsin OligarchsThese are oligarchs as we like to think of them in the West – immensely rich businessmen with the ear of the Kremlin and without which the regime would collapse. The trouble is they don’t exist anymore. Putin – never a fan of “kingmakers” – got rid of them years ago.Under Putin, “the top layer of the economic elite with the right to political vote simply ceased to exist,” writes Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R. Politik, which offers independent analysis on contemporary Russian politics. The new oligarchsFor this group, Russia’s pariah-status on the world stage and isolation could be a benefit. Unlike the jet-setting oligarchs, the strongmen are more ideological and look inward. Repression and autocracy further strengthens their position.“Strongmen have no reason to remove Putin now – he is fulfilling their dream of a ruthless police state,” says Prof Chyzh.How might it play out?In the short term, most experts think both the oligarchs and strongmen will be pushed ever closer to Putin. It’s where their immediate interests lie and, for most, there is no easy or obvious escape. It’s Putin, prison or worse. “The safest solution for the oligarchs – and several have taken this route – is to jump on the bandwagon, embrace the aggressive-repressive direction in Russia’s politics, join the chorus,” says Prof Chyzh.She does see some “silver linings”, however. The oligarchs depend on direct access to Putin for their wider financial power – the ability to guarantee businessmen and businesses that they partner with that agreements will be honoured. But as the voice of the security state grows stronger, this power has started to wane. Moreover, without Putin, the oligarch class may vanish altogether.“Their wealth and status hinge solely on their direct access to Putin – they have no mechanism for legitimating the continuation of their position beyond Putin’s rule”, notes Prof Chyzh. “Their friendship with Putin is not something they can pass on to their children. And Putin is not getting any younger.”Financial pressures are also mounting for ordinary Russians, possibly causing more to question Putin’s narrative.“It is a matter of weeks before the state can no longer pay its employees –  doctors, teachers, administrators, but also the police, the military-industrial complex, and the military itself,” says Prof Chyzh. “No new tanks, destroyers or howitzers – and no soldiers to shoot them either.”But it is in the longer term that most experts see sanctions as having a profound impact, assuming they can be maintained by the West. Already there’s a brain drain of the “best and brightest” middle class, highly educated Russians are leaving in droves. Here experts see parallels with the fall of the Soviet Union. Putin’s Russia may mirror the decline of the USSR during the late Seventies and early Eighties, with an authoritarian elite clinging onto power despite growing discontent as the country stagnates. “Putin has guaranteed his regime’s demise,” says Prof Galeotti, but “it is likely to take years to die.“After all, the Kremlin retains control of the security apparatus that has been beating and arresting the thousands of Russians protesting against this war,” he adds. “But it will be a hollow shell, without legitimacy and purpose, and Putin’s ambitions of carving out a place in history alongside other fabled state-builders as Peter the Great and, implicitly, Joseph Stalin, will be exposed as a sad delusion.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Two children among 21 dead in air strike on SumyRoyals declare truce with The Crown as Camilla jokes with her Netflix ‘alter-ego’Politics latest news: Ministry of Defence will step in to rescue chaotic Ukraine refugee scheme, reveals Ben WallaceInternational Women\u0026#39s Day 2022: How it began and why the fight for women\u0026#39s rights is still necessaryUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as Putin tells mothers \u0026#39I understand your worry\u0026#39New ‘pop-up’ UK visa site for Ukrainian refugees to be established in LilleMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nursing heroes demand pay rise","story":"Nursing heroes demand pay rise of more than % as NHS staff face £ real-terms cutThe Royal College of Nursing today unveils its demand for a pay rise % above the rate of inflation - and the RPI measure hit .% at the time the demand was made.NHS staff march through central London during a protest Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Mar |commentsNurses could lose around £ a year in real-terms pay after a below inflation pay rise proposed by the Government. NHS workers have been offered a paltry % pay rise by the Tories which is likely to be less than half the rate of inflation. Analysis from the Royal College of Nursing shows a nurse with seven years experience in England is set to lose out by around £ a year once National Insurance and pension changes take effect. The % pay proposal to the NHS Pay Review Body comes after a decade of pay stagnation and below inflation settlements. RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “If the Government does not listen it will be to the detriment of patients when more and more nursing staff decide to leave the profession. “With three months until they are expected to make an announcement, they must listen to people who work in our health and care services.  “When a nurse or health care support worker feels no alternative but to leave, it becomes ever more challenging to provide highly effective care and treatment. They deserve salaries fitting of a safety critical profession. “By summer, ministers must come back with a pay award that turns the tide on the years of unfilled nursing jobs and experienced professionals struggling to make ends meet.” The RCN is calling for a pay award of % above the level of inflation. At the time it made its case, the RPI measure of inflation was running at .%. Its submission to the NHS Pay Review Body demonstrated that from April nursing staff will pay more National Insurance and many will see their pensions contributions increase too. It estimates that a nurse earning £, will be £ worse off this financial year compared to the   when they start paying more National Insurance. Government changes to the NHS pension system will sees these iniduals paying £ a year more into their pension scheme.  The combined impact of bigger pension contributions, and increased National Insurance, takes a further £ away from their net pay compared to last year. The NHS Pay Review Body will hear from interested parties before reporting to ministers in May. The Government will then decide whether to implement its recommendations. The RCN submission highlights recent data from the nursing regulator the Nursing and Midwery Council, showing an % increase in nurses in  compared to . The UK Government indicated in February that its NHS pay funding settlement was assuming a pay award of % to %. The amount set aside for NHS pay in Westminster determines the initial funding available in all parts of the UK, despite devolution of health policy. The NHS Pay Review Bodyprocess runs for England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Direct pay negotiations in Scotland are imminent. It comes as the Government claimed it was on track to meet a pledge to increase total nursing numbers in England by , by . The Department of Health and Social care said overall total nurse numbers now stand at , as of December , compared to , in September .Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “It’s fantastic to see the progress we have made towards our manesto commitment of delivering , more nurses by .“There are now over , more nurses providing exceptional care and treatment for patients across the country every day.” Figures from NHS England show there were , nurse vacancies in December, , more than a year earlier. The Government ordered its MPs to vote down a legal amendment to the Health and Care Bill that would require the NHS to commission independent analysis of staffing numbers needed to care for our aging population. Pat Cullen added: “The number of unfilled nurse jobs has risen in the last year, not fallen. “This workforce crisis with tens of thousands of vacant posts is hitting patient care and adds to waiting lists and treatment delays. “Without transparent publication of workforce data, nursing staff will question these claims. “The Government has not been transparent about how it calculates the numbers genuinely needed for safe and effective “This is a political target in the absence of a proper health and care workforce strategy. “Experienced nursing staff who stayed in the profession during the pandemic are now leaving in greater numbers. “One of the simplest ways to keep more staff is a fair pay rise that recognises their professional skill.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WestminsterNational Insurance Company Ltd.Royal College of NursingNHSNursing and Midwery CouncilBoris JohnsonPat CullenPensionsHealth reformsPoliticsInflation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The revelation comes as the Home Office announced  Ukrainians have been granted a visa to join UK family out of , applications started - and .million refugees.It is likely to lead to fresh anger after Priti Patel was bombarded with criticism over families who have ended up in Calais. Hundreds of terried Ukrainians have started to arrive in the French port - but they have to submit a visa applicationthey have family in the UK. Currently this involves an in-person trip to Paris - currently the only UK visa centre in France - or Brussels to give fingerprints and other information. Refugees arriving at one centre today were met with the message: NO VISAS DELIVERED IN CALAIS. The Home Secretary sparked chaos today by announcing Ukrainians will also be able to get visas near Calais - but not yet. The Home Secretary told MPs we have set up a bespoke visa application centre en route to the port. But minutes later she claimed she never said that - and in fact the Home Office was still “setting up” the centre.Officials later said even when it opens, it wonapost be for all applicants in France. A Government spokesperson said it will be by referral from Border Force only to support Ukrainians. The primary Visa Application Centre in France will remain in Paris.” Until it does open, it is understood there are  appointments available at the UKaposs Paris Visa Application Centre this week, and  are protected for Ukrainians. Walk-in appointments are also available at the Visa Application Centre in Brussels but only Wednesday to Friday.Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons: “The Home Office website is still telling people to go to Paris. Journalists who are in Calais and looking for any centre that there might be are still unable to find anything. All they can find is a few Home Office staff in a building with a crisp machine but no visas. One family there this afternoon who have been there for five days have been told they cannot get an appointment in Paris until March . “What on earth is going on ” Ms Patel denied families had been unable to get appointments for a week. Home Office sources insisted there was capacity at centres across Europe. Tonight the Home Office confirmed  visas had been issued so far - updating a figure of  by am yesterday, which the Home Office issued but Ms Patel branded “absolutely inaccurate”. Overall, , Ukraine Family Scheme applications had been started. Of these , have been submitted, , have attended a Visa Application Centre, and  applications have been confirmed. It came as a desperate builder spoke of his devastation after rescuing his we and children from Ukraine but being banned from getting them into the UK.Vitalie Turetska has been living and working in north London for the past three years.When Russia started bombing his home country he jumped in his car and drove to the Ukraine Romania border to get we and Helena and sons Danya, six and two-year-old Mapk. They are just some of the . million refugees who have already fled the terror in their home country. But now they are stranded in Calais after British authorities refused to let them cross the Channel. Vitalie said he was told he was allowed tobut he would have to leave his we and kids behind in France because, in his words, they don’t have the correct paperwork.A full family visa scheme for Ukrainians opened on Friday allowing applications from immediate family extended family and immediate family members of extended family.Immediate family are a spouse or civil partner, unmarried partner in a cohabiting relationship for two or more years, a child under , a parenttheir child in the UK is under , or a fiancee or proposed civil partner. Extended family include grown-up children or their parents, grandparents, grandchildren or partners’ grandchildren, and brothers and sisters. Home Office guidance recommends people apply for a visa “in a nearby country” to Ukraine after fleeing over the border - naming Hungary, Moldova, Poland and Romania. People are asked to complete an application online, travel to the visa centre to give details like fingerprints, then remain in the area until their application is processed.

Summer Monro has lived on a diet of chicken nuggets, chips and crisps for the last two decades due to a rare disorder. The -year-old from Cambridge has avoidant restrictive food intake disorderwhich she believes was triggered when she was forced to eat mashed potato at the age of three. She claims even looking at a piece of fruit or veg will cause her to gag - and even hypnotherapy hasnapost helped. Summer said: All I eat is Birds Eye chicken nuggets or crisps. My weight fluctuates with what I eat. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here I donapost eat fruit or vegetables. I canapost remember the last time I did, Iaposd say it was when I was about three. I have tried to try fruit and veg, I tried to eat some apple but I physically canapost. Itaposs not that I donapost want to try. It just makes me feel sick, thereaposs a part of my brain that physically wonapost let me do it. She added her grandad once offered her £,she would try a garden pea, but she couldnapost do it. On a typical day, Summer will skip breakfast before having a packet of Walkers crisps for lunch and six or eight Birdaposs Eye chicken nuggets for dinner.  She lives with her partner Dean McKnight, , who makes separate meals to his girlfriend every day. The project coordinator has tried therapy an hypnotherapy to cure her ARFID, but claims nothing has worked so far. She said: Iaposm really bored, I donapost get excited to eat. Itaposs worse at lunchtime when people are eating sandwiches and I have a packet of crisps. I just canapost see myself changing. I like the smell of food butI try to eat it, it makes me physically sick. It puts a lot of pressure on me. My heart tells me I want to eat it but my brain says no. As soon as it touches my lips, I canapost do it.Summer recalls being a good eater until she turned three years old and was forced to eat mashed potato, something she couldnapost stand. She said: Thataposs where it all started. The things I eat now are crispy or crunchy. I can only eat thin fries and they have to be really crispy. Even when I cook chicken nuggets, I have to make them crispy. Despite her extremely restrictive diet, Summer insists sheaposs completely healthy and doesnapost need any vitamins or health supplements. However, her food staples were thrown into jeopardy last year when she found a vein in one of her chicken nuggets - and she stopped eating them for three months.  She says that, during this time, she was only eating crisps and averaged a dangerously low  calories per day. Summer said: A lot of people say theyaposre surprised that Iaposm never ill. Iaposm also a very upbeat, happy person and people donapost understand how Iaposve got so much energy. It doesnapost affect me physically but it does mentally. I donapost feel lethargic or anything and Iaposve had blood tests but theyaposre all fine. Doctors donapost really understand the condition. When I go to the doctors, they say Iaposm fine because Iaposm getting protein from the chicken and Iaposm not overweight or underweight. When she tried dferent kinds of therapy, Summer said a woman came shopping with her and talked through dferent foods with her.  Itaposs definitely something to do with the texture. The things I do eat are crispy, which is the opposite to mashed potato, she said. If she ever goes on date nights with Dean, she has to stick to a bowl of crispy french fries - but Summer says Dean is very supportive of her condition. Summer said: My partner takes it really well. When we first met, I didnapost tell him about ARFID and we were walking around town looking for a restaurant and I ended up having to tell him because I kept saying no. When his parents visit, they make all these amazing meals and I canapost eat any of them. Itaposs a struggle when we go out because we have to pick certain places. The most recent place we went to was Zizzis and I had some fries. We go to the local pub and I have some chicken nuggets. Buther loved ones choose restaurants with nothing suitable on the menu, Summer often just goes without. She said: It affects me mentally especially when I go to restaurants and I sit with nothing. We went out for my sisteraposs birthday and I sat and didnapost eat and it made me feel crap.

Rachael Easter, , from Ipswich, split from her husband in March  and was left in a dire financial situation, facing eviction from her family home and in £, debt. Worried for her -year-old son Jackaposs future, Rachael says she was at rock bottom after the break up and didnapost know where to turn. She said: I was a stay at home we and mother, with no money to my name. I didn’t have a job at the time. We were at risk of eviction. The thought that I couldn’t put a roof over my sonaposs head because I relied on another being devastated me. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereRachael claimed Universal Credit to stop herself and Jack becoming homeless, and received £ a week in food vouchers which was given to low-income families during lockdown.Then, she started looking at her outgoings versus what was coming in every month to try and make a dent in the debt. The debt was from my gas and electric provider, water, bank loan, a sofa, and a credit card, she explained. Rachaelaposs rent is £ per month, plus council tax. She pays £ for water bills and had been paying £ for energy - although this had increased to £. Each month, she would receive £- in Universal Credit payments and every four weeks, sheaposd also get £ in child benefit. While she tried out dferent methods of paying off the debt, Rachael decided she needed to start working, and began offering her services as a self-employed cleaner on Facebook in summer .She charged £ an hour and worked up to  hours some weeks - but in others it could be as few as just five. Her universal credit payments ied depending on how many hours she worked - and last year she earned a total of £, from cleaning, which was topped up to £, with UC. Recalling how she paid of a huge amount of the debt she owed, Rachael said she tried the snowball method. I sorted my household bills first including water, and gas and electricity. I called the companies and with both monthly bills they put my debt on top, she said.Then I used the snowball method to manage it. Which means I paid off the smallest of all the debts first before moving onto the larger debts. Rachael said her motivation for getting the debt paid off on her own was her son Jack - but she worried she was taking on too much at once and had to make huge sacrices. The mum, who doesnapost drive, was so determined to get working that she sometimes walked an hour to and from cleaning jobs. She also started the p challenge, which involved saving a little bit of money every day, starting with a penny. The next day you save two pence, and so on. By the end of a year, youaposll save £. and have a total of £. in savings. She also created online Monzo savings pots for spare money - which she uses for birthdays, Christmas, driving lessons and regular savings. Rachael said: I would move money from my bank to my Monzo pots. Before, I would have just used the money here and there and it would have disappeared. But I’ve been making a conscious effort to put it aside. I’m now also able to give my son pocket money once a week buthe hasnapost done anything to earn it I put it in his Monzo pot to help with a car or deposit when heaposs older. ThenI do an extra cleaning job or have an additional ironing customer, I split what I earn - half onto the debt and half towards my savings. Another way Rachael made up the cash she owed was by selling unused items she had in her house - and thinks this is a great tip for making money quickly. As well as her cleaning job, Rachael set up a side hustle, which she calls her hobby hustle, selling decorated vases with her friend. To keep costs down in her day-to-day le, Rachael draws up meal plans to keep her weekly shop to a minimum and uses vouchers and discounts where she can.While trying to save money, Rachael discovered the debt-free community on Instagram and set up her own page, @getstuffdone_withcoffee to share her progress and top tips.She also uses the page to talk about house cleaning and mental health - and receives plenty of support from her , followers.  I was so embarrassed of my situation and I wanted to improve all aspects of my le so I set up my page, Rachael said. Just  months on from starting her debt-free journey, Rachael had paid of £, of the debt sheaposd accumulated. My house is becoming a home, I have savings, a small amount but more than I have ever had before, debt clearing and a new lease of le, she said, adding sheaposs so proud of what sheaposs achieved. Since becoming more financially independent, Rachael is sure anyone  can manage what she has - particularly single parents. I still have a long way to go but my target for this year  is to become debt free and pass my driving test which will open up more opportunities, she explained. I now have under £ debt left to pay and by the end of the year I will be debt free. As the future is always uncertain with prices of bills and food I am currently looking for a part time job to make sure myself and my boy are secure. ButI can do it, I hope it shows other single parents that they can do it too.

Cameron said: “I remember sitting in my six-hundred-and-fty-pounds a month room in a shared bungalow watching YouTube and stumbling across van le videos. “I was hooked and couldn’t believe that it was a real lestyle that people live. “A few weeks later, a housemate told us that he would be moving out which left us all thinking what to do. “With ten years of carpentry experience and one-hundred hours of van le videos behind me, I knew what my plan was. I was going to move into a van.  “After the initial investment, this would allow me to put my old rent money to one side and work towards building myself a future. “I needed plenty of storage space to store my tools for work and I needed something I could easily stand up and move around in. “When the riot van popped up on eBay, I knew it was perfect, with all the additional security that comes from its former le as well as the box shape which makes for an easy conversion.” Keeping with the police theme, Cameron decided to name his van ‘Kevlarapos after the bulletproof material.  Cameron and Rachel, who first met in , reconnected online and became a couple at the beginning of . Since then, they have spent time travelling the UK together with Cameron’s husky Odin - visiting the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, road tripping around Wales, rambling in the Peak District and taking in the panoramic scenery of the Lake District. The couple says that their love and appreciation for nature has only increased since living in the van full time and being able to live sustainably by generating all of their power from solar is very important to them. They also have managed to reduce their expenses since there is no rent to pay and no room to fill the van with lots of materialistic possessions. The couple estimates that they have saved approximately £, on rent, utilities and unnecessary expenditures since living in their van.  For Rachel, one of the hardest parts of van le is not having a warm bath to soak in, but she admits that this is a small price to pay for the idyllic le the couple share together. However, the pandemic lockdowns throughout  did prove to be a challenge for Cameron and Rachel since waste disposal and recycling plants were closed, leaving them reliant on finding a large supermarket or help from friends to get rid of their rubbish. For Rachel, the benefits of van le far outweigh the challenges it poses.  Rachel said: “We love being so close to nature all the time. Since living in the van, we definitely look outdoors more for entertainment and we have so much more appreciation for the world we live in. “Obviously the ability to cut out a lot of expenses is brilliant too, we get our electricity from the sun. “There isnapost rent to pay and because of having a smaller home, you donapost spend as much money on material possessions.  “Small living also means weaposre able to be a lot more environmentally conscious. We know exactly how much water, gas, and power we use each week and despite living in a vehicle, our carbon footprint is so much lower. “The beauty of living in a van is that Cameron can pretty much take work anywhere, without worrying about a commute - this means we also get to explore places that we wouldnapost necessarily visit on a holiday. “Having a home on wheels means we never have to pack or plan around our work commitments - we can be as spontaneous as we like.  Whilst for many couples, living in such close proximity for so long would cause friction, Cameron and Rachel say that their relationship has only gotten stronger. The pair say that communication is vital, as is being able to happily pursue their own hobbies which include sketching and reading together in peace. “Communication is always key in a relationship, but we think itaposs probably, even more, the case when youaposre living small,” Rachel explained. “We donapost find the constant proximity an issue and we still spend our downtime doing things we love. “When we arenapost spending time outdoors, Cameron likes to sketch and I like to read, and we often find peace in just doing activities we enjoy. “On the occasions where one of us needs a little bit more space, the other can take Odin out for a walk, or go and meet friends, or busy themselves where.“We actually find that living in close proximity to each other has made our relationship really strong. “We know each other very well and are able to freely ask for alone time when we need it.” Rachel and Cameron have no plans to change their living arrangements anytime soon and plan to travel around Europe when the time is right. “We have no immediate plans to move away from van le because we want to travel around Europe and in particular Scandinavia, and freely explore even more of the UK,” said Rachel. “Our long term dream would be to buy land and build our own tiny home on it or to restore an old property and create a new sustainable home in its place. “Regardless of where our future takes us, we have no plans to get rid of Kevlar and will be keeping her with us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON eBayLake DistrictRoad tripsSavings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Matthew, and Christine Mullan say the project has allowed them to put their stamp on the place. Christine, , designed and project managed the renovation and ensured statutory requirements were kept to. An architect aposwho has the ideas and visionapos, she took itfrom start to finish. Matthew, , is an engineer and helped come up with solutions for his weaposs idea. Heaposs aposhands onapos and comes up with aposclever solutionsapos.The pair share interiors inspiration on Instagram through their page @architect_v_engineer.Christine told BelfastLive : We bought a s detached home. Although a very solid property, it had never been updated so we undertook a full renovation, taking it back to the bare bones.A three month contractor renovation build allowed us to move in December  and we then have undertaken the aesthetic as an ongoing project, doing this work ourselves.  We wanted a family home that was inidually designed to our needs - something we could have a bit of fun with and put our own stamp on. It’s all about family for us. We redesigned the layout on the ground floor and knocked walls down to create a large open plan living space. We took the house back to the bare structure, replumbed, rewired, replaced all the windows and updated it throughout.  We also converted some outside stores into the house to create a secret playroom for the kids. The -year-old explained what the hardest parts of renovating a property can be.She said:Budget, timescales and the unknown of an existing property.Some of our ideas finishes have been dferent to the norm and sometimes it hard to get tradespeople on board with the vision - it’s not always the easy option.  And for the best bits, the architect added: The best part was seeing our design come to le. Our children have been involved throughoutand seeing them be proud of what we have created makes it all worth it. With work still undergoing, the couple are pleased with the finished rooms and have many more transformation ideas.  For others currently renovating their home, Christine said: You will get there in the end. Sometimes it all becomes a bit much but when you get there, it is all worth it. Go with your gut and ideas, and don’t be put off by other peopleaposs opinions. We were relativity lucky, we didn’t have too many issues with the renovation in terms of building work.  However some of our ideas need a bit of trial and error to perfect. We are in the process of making our own worktops for our utility room and are now on the second attempt. Christine added where she gains interiors ideas from. Our inspiration came from experience in design and lot of Pinterest Houzz mood boards. We created our Instagram page architect_v_engineer for us - to track our progress but I didn’t appreciate the supportive community there was.  Itaposs absolutely now a place for inspiration and support, she said. She also has some money saving tips: Shop around! If you find something you like use the internet and seeyou can find it somewhere  at a better price. We saved over £sqm on the same tiles by doing some research. Also don’t feel like you have to do everything in one go.Make a list of what needs done and what you would like. Building work structure are all necessary but all the decoration can be done over time. We don’t do too much interior shopping, instead we tend to design and make a lot of pieces ourselves so they are unique and personal to us.

The -year-old does not want to move out of his home because he claims the council have undervalued the property at just £,.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section The father also said his family would be unable to buy another apartment in South Acton for that amount and so would be priced out of the area. He argues that instead of demolishing the buildings on the South Acton Estate, they should just be refurbished.Speaking to the BBC for the programme Hanging On To Home: A Place Called Home , Yacob said: “Why should it be demolished without a valid reason  Because it could be refurbished and there is no reason why it should be demolished.” Yacob and his family, who moved to the estate thirteen years ago, are the only people living in their apartment block, something he said made him feel “vulnerable” and “unsafe”. Yacob also claimed that, since the revamp project began, the council has neglected his apartment block, letting it become dirty.  BBC footage shows the stairwell of Yacob’s apartment block with dirt and bird poo on the stairs and grimy windows. One corner of the stairwell has what appears to be an active bird nest with an egg in it. Because of his refusal to sell the property to them, Ealing Council issued Yacob with a compulsory purchase order, meaning they could buy the flat at any moment without his permission.  According to the BBC, over  residents have been moved from the estate since January  Yacob said: “I don’t think it is regeneration, it is gentrication that is happening because all the leaseholders I know have moved out of the area.” There will be a public enquiry into Yacob’s case later this year.  A spokesperson for Ealing Council told the BBC: We are replacing the existing poor quality social housing with enough new, better quality homes to accommodate all existing residents who want to continue living on the estate. The majority of the [existing] homes have intrinsic and fundamental design issues that refurbishment would not address. The buy-back process, CPO Code and appointment of independent valuers ensures leaseholders receive full market value for their home, plus a generous package of compensation.Mr Woldehiwot is the only one whose approach has triggered a need to exercise our compulsory purchase powers. We will continue to attempt to engage and negotiate with Mr Woldehiwot. If it cannot be agreed between us, the value of his home and compensatory package payable will be determined at a tribunal.

WhatCar reports that drivers are banned from parking their cars against the flow of traffic as the reflectors would not be picked up by oncoming vehiclesParking your car the wrong way at night could incur a hefty fine Image: Getty ImagesByAriane Sohrabi-ShirazSEO EditorLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Jan Updated:,  Mar |commentsA little known Highway Code rule could see motorists slapped with a fine between £, and £, -they park against the flow of traffic at night time. WhatCar, an automobile magazine, reports that drivers are actually banned from parking their cars against the direction of traffic unless there’s a marked out parking space. Even the most disciplined driver could be forgiven for not knowing this unusual fact. The Highway Code lists under Rule  that a car must not be parked at the side of the road facing against the direction of traffic unless in a recognised parking space”. If it is, then you could be breaking the law.This is because parking facing the traffic on unlit roads can be extremely dangerous, according to car scrapping comparison site, scrapcarcomparison. This means it could be harder for other motorists to detect what you are doing, potentially leading to crashes.  Cars parked in the same direction of traffic will have the rear reflectors illuminated. A spokesman said: Motors parked the correct way would be visible and illuminated by headlights bouncing off the rear reflectors. We’ve dealt with cars that have been written-off due to a passing car crashing into them as they have partly stuck out from a parking space. For most vehicles, the offence could cost around £,, whereas for eight-seaters, this jumps to £,. However, drivers donapost need to worry about this during the day, but as it gets darker it could become an issue. Another sloppy parking habit has seen motorists fined for leaning slightly over the edge of a parking bay - an expensive start to the year and unwelcome surprise after Christmas. Leaving your car stationary in a parking bay should be a fairly straightforward process - but you can actually get finedyou donapost stick to the rules.As the Mirror reported last year, a driver left the side of his car protruding slightly over the bay line in Birmingham City Centre, encroaching on the space next door. He was charged £ for doing so. The fine - which would be reduced to £paid within  days - was issued by private firm Premier Parking Enforcement LTD who are contracted by building management company Remus.

Fire crew have been asked to work on the baggage belts and travellers complained of massive lines at security that took hours to get through, it has been claimed.Queues at check-in desks were described as beyond a joke causing some people to miss their flights and leaving others in tears on Monday. It marked the second day of delays at the international hub amid staff shortages which saw some passengers stuck on the runway for two-and-a-half hours.One airport worker told the Manchester Evening News : “It’s been so bad that they have been asking firefighters, engineers and parking staff to offload the bags onto the conveyors in the arrivals hall. “I think the summer is going to be horrendous, at this rate we just won’t have the staff, and morale is already low. I just hope that we get the staff we need in time and get back to normal. One woman said her flight to Gran Canaria with TUI departed more than two hours late due to delays getting the baggage on the plane. Kathleen Moorland said she was still sitting on the plane on the runway at .pm, when it was meant to be departing at .am.She added that there were delays getting through queues at the airport, despite arriving more than three hours before her flight. Kathleen said: TUI and Manchester Airport, a total farce and joke. All you want is an easy start to your holiday - not the total chaos that there is. Julia Teale tweeted: @manairport. You really need to sort your staffing issues. Just witnessed people missing flights who have been here three hours but security was so disorganised it’s taking hours to get through. If it’s like this in March what will it be like in high season. Not enough staff.  Martijn van der Voort also tweeted: When will @manairport @AndyBurnhamGM @ManCityCouncil grasp that the airport is one of the worst in the world  From rude security staff to long queues to poor infrastructure and parking. Truly terrible airport and I have been to many across the globe. On Sunday, passengers were also faced with ridiculous two-hour queues amid a workforce shortage, sparking fears of more chaos for passengers in the busy summer ahead. It is estimated that more than , redundancies were made at Manchester Airport as the aviation sector was savaged by the pandemic. This included around  workers employed directly by the hub and more than , by outside employers like baggage handling agents and airlines.Now travel restrictions are lting, passenger numbers are on the rise and plans to reopen Terminal  are also in the pipeline. But questions have been raised as to whether the workforce can meet demand in what Manchester Airport bosses have described as an extremely challenging labour market. Airport bosses apologised over long delays and horrendous queues at passport control on Friday. A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said queues on both days were due to a greater number of passengers than expected. Passengers have been urged to get to the airport at least three hours before their scheduled flight time. A spokesperson for Swissport, which handles baggage for TUI, said: “We would like to apologise to those passengers who experienced baggage delays at Manchester Airport following an aircraft change which impacted our resource allocation. We have worked with our airport partners to remedy the delays and normal service has resumed. Thehas contacted Manchester Airport for further comment.

He said: There was a marquee and everything. I remember Kate was standing in the middle on her own. And nobody was talking to her or going near her because they didn’t know who she was or recognise her. I went over and chatted to her while we waited for Will to come in and it was quite sweet. But now - could you imagine Kate in the middle of a room and no one speaking to her  It just wouldn’t happen, she’d be mobbed.  Harrold went on to say the memory showed just how much has changed since the couple got engaged as now it would be very unlikely for Kate to be standing alone at a party. After seven years of dating, William proposed to Kate on Safari in Kenya. The couple shared the happy news one month later in November . On  April , they married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey.Harold spoke about the changes heaposd noticed in Kate since his time working with her before she was a royal. There’s part of her that’s now very royal, he said, because obviously she’s a future Queen and she’s had to fit into that role. She was just great, she was down to earth, she was fun, with a wonderful sense of humour, he continued. Kate had to make a lot of sacrices when she met married into the Royal Family - such as saying goodbye to impromptu supermarket visits or outings with friends. But William made her a promise that the one thing she would never have to leave behind was her family - and heaposs still keeping it to this day.

Sunita Brittain, , was convinced Michael Anderson was the love of her le - and fell for him after meeting online. He told her he was a successful businessman and multi-millionaire working as a global engineer and cryptocurrency analyst. They exchanged thousands of messages and photos, and he even told her he loved her and wanted to spend his le with her - even though they had never met.But, in chilling echoes of the hit Netflix show The Tinder Swindler, he then began asking for money. He said he needed £, to get him out of a jail in Northern Cyprus – following an accident at his engineering project out there. Michael pleaded with her for the money in so many calls she even lost a job as a teaching assistant for keeping her phone on her during work. She then sent the money to an account for what Michael said was his lawyer. aposMichaelapos claimed he needed the money for flights to Britain. Sunita then realised something was up and called her bank and told them she feared she had been scammed - and they told her they had frozen the account. aposMichaelapos then began ringing her making threats, harassing her and told her he would find out where she lived. Sunita met him online in January but has now not heard from him for a few weeks - and has no ideasheaposll get her money back.Sunita, mother-of-two from Harworth, Notts, said: aposaposMy story parallels with the Tinder Swindler, it is crazy. I was so vulnerable, I had just come out of a loveless marriage, was going through a orce and was just craving some kind of attention to make me feel wanted again. aposaposHe started talking to me in a very intimate way and made me feel like the only woman in the whole world. “He was telling me things that you imagine in a fairytale, with that happily ever after ending.”She met her scammer on the Facebook dating site ‘Facebook Dating ❤️’ on January .‘Michael Anderson’, who said he was the owner of a multi-million-pound global engineering company and cryptocurrency analyst, initiated a conversation with Sunita.Michael swtly asked for her number, and the pair exchanged thousands of messages on WhatsApp, with Michael initiating heavy conversations.Michael told Sunita he was born on the exact same day as her and was adopted - like her - by his parents from Zurich.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  On January , Sunita and Michael chatted on the phone for the first time and she was convinced of her fraudsteraposs feelings. Sunita, whose children are  and  years old, said there were a few red flags that she admits “dismissing” because of her feelings for Michael. One was his refusal to show his face on video call. “I found it strange why he never wanted to Facetime”, she admitted. “He said he was camera shy – the one time I tried, the image from his side was blurry and he looked about  years older than his pictures.” Michael conjured up his elaborate ruse on the  January, when he told Sunita he had to go immediately to one of his engineering projects out in Northern Cyprus. Sunita said: “Michael told me he had to rush out there as there had been a ‘tragic accident’ and he had to provide a huge pay-out of £, to one of the families. “Three days later, he told me the Cyprus Police are holding him in custody. “He continued to say how much he loved me and how we will be together when this is all over. He called himself aposThe Kingapos and me aposThe Queenapos and told me how much he felt the connection of great love.”Mr Anderson instructed Sunita to make three separate bank transfers to what he claimed was his lawyeraposs offshore bank account. Sunita logged on to his fake account on HorizoGlobal – which has no link to Horizon Global - she later discovered that HorizoGlobale was a fake bank - but where she could see Michael had over £million in his fabricated bank account. He told her to transfer three separate transactions to his lawyer – two of £, and one of £, – which got rejected. “I could see the money in his account going down, it was so realistic and didn’t even cross my mind that it was a fake website, she said. “He kept telling me the lines were down and there was no Wi, so I had to keep transferring the money in instalments because he was unable to do it himself. On January , Sunita received a fake email from aposHorizoGlobalapos saying Mr Anderson cannot transfer any more money because of “security reasons”. The email was alerting her they have frozen Michael’s assets until they can see him face-to-face in their Head Office based in Los Angeles. Sunita said: “I got calls from Michael and he was starting to stress out – saying he would have to sell his bitcoin and borrow money off his lawyer. “He told me to send the bank my ID and lie saying I was his finance. “He said he would rather pay the compensation rather than lose his trading business license and needed to buy flights to come home back to me. “He started guilt-tripping me, begging me to help him – saying he would pay me back.” That was the moment Sunita made the transaction of £, to the bank account of a second fake identity this time a aposMr David Gana’sapos bank account – Mr Anderson’s lawyer based in Coventry. Michael sent Sunita screenshots of his flights back to Doncaster on January , where she was planning to pick him up from before going straight to LA on the Sunday so they could “prove Michael’s identity for his offshore bank account”. Sunita said: “My suitcase was packed and I was so excited. “I couldn’t get hold of Michael all afternoon, and suddenly I received a call from one of his ‘lawyers’ saying Michael was arrested by police officials on his flight home for ‘tax evasion’, his phone had been taken away and he was stuck in Police Custody. “I rung my best friend, telling her about everything that happened and how I was supposed to be going to America. “She asked me how much I had given him so I told her. “That is when she said, ‘Sunita. Wake up. You’ve been scammed – you have kids to think of, he could’ve killed youapos. “She could tell right away and that is when the penny dropped and I knew that I had been scammed. “The whole thing may seem desperate but when you’re on your own, these scammers play with your mind and people don’t understand that. “When you isolate yourself from people, you can be blind-sighted by somebody getting into your head.” Sunita immediately notied her bank, who froze her account and got in contact with the Action Fraud Police Unit. Michael has since been harassing Sunita, phoning her to unfreeze her bank account. He suddenly turned nasty and started threatening me that he would find out where I live Sunita said. Heaposs been calling me on dferent numbers and shouting, itaposs terrying and just horric. On Feb  I opened my blinds and saw a suspicious van parked right outside my house so I immediately called the police. I have two children and nowhere  to go and just want to stop this from happening to anyone .

Freezing temperatures, though, this month means that odds have been slashed on it being the coldest March ever, moving to  .Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: Thereaposs every chance this month breaks records on the weather front with the odds continuing to drastically tumble.Going into Tuesday and it will be a cold but bright start with a low pressure front coming in from the Atlantic competing with high pressure from the continent.  Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: “Tuesday will be a windy day but bright for some and dry for many before rain arrives across more western areas.” She continued: “Winds towards the north west as well as the north east could actually touch near gale force for a time, afflicting shower or two can’t be ruled outtowards the far south west. But inland where that cloud breaks up temperatures fall quite quickly so expect a quite widespread frost,lowest temperatures in northern counties of England, particularly rural spots, central parts of Scotland coming in at around -C or -C. Despite a frosty start it will be a bright one, certainly across central Scotland you will see some bright weathernot some sunshine.  Still that driving wind coming in from the south though. Northern Ireland seeing more in the way of cloud and some patchy cloud for Wales as well as the West Country but a crisp start to the day further east with some sunshine. Then we watch through Tuesday as the brighter and drier weather becomes confined to central and eastern parts of Scotland as well as England as the cloud thickens from the west and eventually we will see some rain arrive across Cornwall as well as Devon, Pembrokeshire, Northern Ireland and by the end of the day western Scotland.  This rain will be heavy at times, coupled with the wind which will touch gale force particularly across the north west of Scotland, gusts along the Western Isles could actually peak at mph so a windy day, a lively day but a bright one. There is set to be more heavy rain and wind for Wednesday while the outlook remains unsettled for the rest of the week but Thursday is likely to be the warmest day with temperatures possibly getting up to the mid teens. BBC weather forecaster Matt Taylor said Temperatures could rise further as we go into Thursday, as you can see the low pressure bands ganging up but fizzling out when they run into the high pressure system. So it does look as though Thursday is the driest brightest day of the week. UK forecast for the next  days Bright in the east, rain and strong winds in west. Today: Dry and rather cold with sunny spells, although cloudier in the west with a band of rain moving eastwards, followed by sunshine and showers for Northern Ireland and southwestern areas later. Windy with coastal gales in the west. Tonight: Band of cloud and rain moving across remaining areas, heavy in the northwest, but little rain in the east. Clear spells following, but rain, some heavy for Northern Ireland later. Wednesday: Dry, bright and breezy in east after low cloud clears. Cloud and rain in far west moving into other western areas, heavy in northwest with some snow over hills later. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Cloudy and windy with rain at times in the west. Drier with sunshine in the southeast, warm in the sunshine, but rain arriving Friday. Showers Saturday with further rain later.

And, seemingly astrue to form, the outlet of the popular pub chain appears to have made a howler as Hannah found the unsavoury ingredient as she bit into a mushroom, StokeOnTrentLive reports.A Spoons spokesman has since apologised for not identying the plastic upon visual inspection.Have your say on this story in the comment section Hannah ordered the fried egg, bacon, sausage, two hash browns and toast - and a refillable coffee for £., Stoke on Trent Live reports. In her review of the meal she said writes that that things took a turn for the worse when she bit into her mushroom. She wrote: As I bit into the mushroom, I felt something hard and sharp in my mouth - and brought out a piece of black plastic. Fortunately, it didnapost cut or scratch me, but it was a bit of an unpleasant surprise. It was impossible to tell where it might have come from as there were no distinguishing marks.  Surpisingly, generous Hannah said the experience has not entirely put her off the outlet. She says staff offered her a refund straight away, after the discovery of the plastic shard which was the size of £ coin. While it wasnapost ideal to discover plastic in my breakfast, I do have to praise the helpfulness and professionalism of the staff, who told me that they would look into where it might have come from, she added. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said the plastic appeared to have come from damage to a plastic tray the mushrooms were stored in.Eddie said: We sincerely apologise that a small piece of plastic was found in the meal. Having investigated the matter with the management team, it is understood that the plastic tray in which the mushrooms were delivered and stored may have sustained damage during transit and, as a result, a small piece of plastic appears to have broken off. In accordance with Wetherspoon’s internal operating procedures, the plastic will be sent to our quality assurance team for examination in order to very that it originated from the delivery tray. Wetherspoon has procedures in place to check all deliveries for signs of damage or foreign bodies. Regrettably, on this occasion, the plastic was not identied upon a visual inspection. We are pleased to note that the customer was happy with the way in which the pub team dealt with the incident. The company wishes to echo the apology provided by the pub staff and looks forward to welcoming the customer back for a meal in one of our pubs in the near future.

And the highly anticipated interview saw the couple lt the lid on le behind Palace walls and make several shocking allegations about their family. Some of the issues raised by the pair threw up more questions about their time as senior working royals - and despite the past  months, some of these questions still remain... Who is the aposroyal racistapos  One of the most shocking lines from Harry and Meghanaposs bombshell tell-all interview was a claim that Harry had conversations within the royal household about how dark son Archieaposs skin might have been before he was born.During the interview, Meghan refused to say who the conversations had been with, saying it would be very damaging to them. Later in the chat, Harry also said he would never reveal the details of the conversations - although it was later reported the comments were not made by the Queen or the late Duke of Edinburgh. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .After the interview aired, a statement was issued by the Queen, which read: The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may y, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members. Meanwhile, Prince William hit back at the claims and insisted they were very much not a racist family when asked by a reporter. However, the identity of the person alleged to have made the comments is still to be revealed. Who denied Meghan help for her mental health  During the interview, Meghan opened up about her mental health struggles and admitted she had suicidal thoughts during her time in the royal family.She explained how she didnapost want to be alive anymore and when asked directlyshe was thinking of self-harm and having suicidal thoughts at some stage, Meghan replied yes. Meghan says that Harry cradled her when she told him, and he later admitted it sent him to a dark place. When she asked the palace to seek professional help, Meghan said she was told she couldnapost get any - how it is still not known who told Meghan she was not allowed to seek help. What really went on between Meghan and Kate   There were numerous reports that Meghan made the Duchess of Cambridge cry during a bridesmaid dress fitting in the lead up to her wedding to Harry.But during her one-on-one with Oprah, Meghan claimed it was actually Kate that made her cry.Meghan said she has now forgiven Kate, adding that sheaposs a good person and that Kate sent her flowers to apologise for the incident - although gave no details on what sparked the incident, and it is still not known for certain. What caused the rt with William  Before the interview, there had been much speculation about the growing rt between Harry and his older brother William. It was reportedly sparked by Williamaposs concerns over Harryaposs fast-developing relationship with Meghan and the tense row quickly boiled over. The younger prince then claimed in the Oprah interview that his brother was trapped within the royal system - although did not go into detail over what caused their reported feud. Why did Charles stop taking Harryaposs calls  Another bombshell made by Harry came when he said he felt let down by his father Prince Charles and was cut off financially. He also claimed that his dad stopped taking his calls - but there has been no further detail on why this was the case.

Linzi and Lee Steer, who run Project reveal - Ghosts of Britain say their latest capture is the clearest image they have taken in their decades of ghost hunting experience. The couple from Rotherham, who have over  years of paranormal research experience between them, have snapped what many of their fans believe is an apparition in the form of a ghostly face.The experienced investigators live stream all their hunts and they were alerted to the spooky visage when fans spotted it on a Facebook clip,Yorkshire Live reports. I just canapost get over it. It is so clear and distinctive, said Linzi. The pair spotted the photo after a visit to Inveraray Jail.The couple, who go on daily ghost hunts, live-stream all of their investigations on Facebook and ask viewers to screenshot any unusual sightings. But when they looked back at the photos from their trip to the Scottish jail and courtroom, they were left shocked. A figure can be seen behind a waxwork model in multiple screenshots, according to Linzi. While she said she could not see the figure while she was filming, she has been left unable to explain what her viewers saw. Linzi said: We try to debunk everything, but thereaposs no dummy there in that particular area.  She added: It is definitely not human. If it was one of us you could tell with the colouring, but it looked very transparent. The apparent figure wasnapost the only spooky part of their trip either. Husband Lee revealed he had an unnerving experience when looking around the siteaposs jail blocks. I walked into one of them and I felt a tickling sensation on my throat, and it started to get more intense to the point where I had to run outside, he said. Although they didnapost know it at the time, the couple were later told by staff that many people have reported feeling a choking sensation in the same spot. Lee added: That is the first time Iaposve ever felt that kind of thing. Iaposm actually sceptical when it comes to ghosts.You can see the screenshots for yourself and see more of the investigatorsapos work here.

Plus, rarely in le do we actually try one type of tea bag directly after the other, unless youaposre at some sort of fancy tea tasting experience, and so itaposs sometimes dficult to discern which brand actually comes out on top. With this in mind, I decided to pit five iconic tea brands against each other, in what I promise is far more than just a very cheeky excuse to nab a particularly y tea break at work.I sampled bags from Tetleyaposs, Yorkshire Tea, PG Tips, Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend and Twinings, ranking each one in terms of all-important factors such as flavour, moreish-ness and, of course, how well they take a good biscuit dunking.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. PG Tips -  ******* £. from the Co-op for  bags of teaFirst things first, I went for a slug of PG Tips fas this has become, for whatever reason, my tried and trusted bag of choice in recent years, a brand which I chuck in the basket without really thinking too much about it.However, this just goes to show that you should branch out every now and then when it comes to your store cupboard staples, with this household name not quite hitting the mark when compared to its fellow tea break giants. PG Tips doesn’t quite pack the same powerful punch as other teas, and I noticed a slightly thin, watery taste when compared with more flavourful options. Despite not making too much of an impact on me, this is still an enjoyable drink, with no lingering unpleasant aftertaste. I also found that the more subtle notes made it ideal for biscuit dipping.Twinings - .  ********   £. Tesco for pack of Being at the pricier end of the spectrum, I would usually only plump for TwiningsI spied it on offer somewhere. Given that it does feel rather more suited to afternoon scones with the Queen than a rushed, microwaved job ahead of mid-week Zoom calls, it doesnapost exactly feel in sync with my day-to-day le.However, that said, this is a very good quality tea, and one that I donapost mind buying every now and then as a special treat. Of course, I had to sip it from my fanciest Jane Austen Museum china cup, like the lady I am and was pleased as ever by the light flavours and comforting toastiness. One of the more distinctive teas on the market, Twinings doesnapost have the same bitterness that spoils so many other products. But it narrowly misses out on the top spot given that the perfumed notes may get a little cloying after a few brew rounds. It felt wrong to submerge a biscuit in this one, but I had a good go anyway.Tetleys - .  ******   £. for  tea bags at Tesco Iaposve never personally been a Tetleyaposs drinker, and canapost say that Iaposve ever bought a bag myself as an adult. However, I have some vague memories of collecting the little figurine men as a kid, so the bag did infuse a bit of nostalgia.Admittedly, I was a little disappointed after going in for a gulp, and have to say that Iaposm somewhat surprised that this brand is as popular as it is, being the leading tea brand in UK convenience and independent grocery stores as of , according to Statistica. To be perfectly honest, I found Tetleyaposs to have quite a bitter, earthy taste which may well take a little getting used to for those used to smoother beverages. There was also quite a gravelly, dentistaposs waiting room-esque aftertaste that I would have expected from a lesser-known, cheaper label. I didnapost bother to dunk.Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend -   ******** p for a pack of  at AldiI love Aldi and do the majority of my recipe shopping there, but this is the first time Iaposve gone for a bag of Aldiaposs own tea.Although I do like to be adventurous with my food, Iaposm a stickler for habit when it comes to tea and coffee brands, and - I must say - Iaposve learned a lesson on this front.I opted for a pack of Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend and was immediately impressed by the pretty scenic packaging, which looks a far cry from what youaposd typically imagine a discount box of tea to look like. However, the most pleasant surprise of all was the quality taste, with mellow, rounded mouthfuls making for a very satisfying - and biscuit-worthy - post-sht pick-me-up. Being by far the best bang for your buck, this makes for a thrty swap likely to please even the pickiest of tea drinkers.  Yorkshire Tea -   ********** £. at the Co-op for  tea bagsAs Iaposve said, Iaposve mostly drunk PG Tips in recent times, but Iaposve previously been a Yorkshire Tea drinker through and through. This taste test made me wonder why Iaposd ever bothered to swap. Classic, hearty, and above all reassuring, Yorkshire Tea is a hardy brew built to weather the ious storms in le, and I knew it wouldnapost disappoint.Strong, yet moreish, flavourful but not overwhelming, this is the tea Iaposd opt for in a desert island scenario, knowing that it comforts me in my loneliest moments. In all honesty, the only reason Iaposm not giving this king of teas a solid ten out of ten is that Iaposm sure thereaposs some independent tea shop in some country village somewhere that might have just pipped it to the post. However,there is, Iaposm yet to find it. After some consideration, there can be no worthier winner than Yorkshire Tea, quite rightly voted as the UKaposs favourite brand last year in a poll by Tea and Coffee .The ever-elegant Twinings was my second runner-up, with Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend coming in a very respectable third. My old go-to PG Tips didnapost quite compare, ranking fourth in the list, while Tetleys was my least favourite of the bunch.Do you have a food or drink-related story to tell  We pay for stories.

Many people opt for a wingman to help them navigate the dating pool on a night out - enabling them to come across as an interesting and exciting person who somebody would want to spend time with.But rather than helping a friend, one woman has been acting as aposwingwomanapos for her one-year-old dog after she fell in love with the dog across the street. Describing her pugaposs one-sided love story on Reddit, the owner explained how her dog, Sally, spends hours gazing out their firth floor flat window in hopes of catching a glimpse of a neighbouring golden retriever.She said: My dog, who is usually scared of everything, is besotted with the dog over the road.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  I have noticed how she always goes to stare out this one window which is directly opposite but one floor down - a golden retriever called Barney lives there. When he is at the window, she just wags her tail while looking at him and he stares back. I canapost seehis tail is wagging too.But when he isnapost there, she pines and sighs. She is in such an awful mood when he isnapost there. Itaposs so sad - I just want to cuddle and console her.The woman explained how Sally and Barney play in the courtyard outside her flats when theyaposre both on a walk at the same time - saying her pug becomes aposjealousapos when the golden retriever approaches other dogs. They spend a lot of time snfing each otheraposs bums and play fighting. Sally always chases after him when Barney goes over to other dogs too, said the woman.

We are friendly and have joked about it quickly but I donapost think he thought anything of it. Questioning whether it would be weird to ask Barneyaposs owner on a doggy date on behalf of her pug, the woman asked users for their thoughts. While most users agreed she should try to organise a play date for the dogs, others thought it could turn into a great meet cute between the owners too. One user said: I donapost think you would sound like a weirdo at all! It might even be a good opportunity to make a friend. As a dog mum, I would be so excited to hear this and would love to get the dogs together often. Whataposs the worst that could happen  They say no  Oh well. Another user added: That’s so cute! Not weird at all. My dog has a aposboyfriendapos named Charles. They get so excited to see each other that he will drag his owner to my dog and my dog will drag me to him. They’re both fixed so no worries there. I’ve requested play dates and have them fine.

My late dog, Sandwich, and our friendaposs dog, Rihanna, were like soulmates.Neither of us ever saw our respective dogs treat any other dog the way they treated each other.

Speaking during a conference alongside two other captured Russians, he said: “I cannot find the words to say sorry to the Ukrainian people. “I just sincerely hope for your mercy towards those people who come to you with their hands up, or those who are wounded. We should not sow death. Itaposs better to sow le. “I donapost know why we were doing it. We knew very little. We brought sorrow to this land. He added that he was prepared to go to jail for his part in the war on their peaceful neighbours.Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog The Lt Col is believed to be the most senior Russian officer to so far speak out against the atrocities levelled at Ukraine since Putin ordered the invasion last month. He told reporters the order had taken him by surprise and that he and his men had been lied to about the situation in Ukraine. The press conference was held last week but was widely shared on Monday. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On March , Ukraine claimed to have killed , Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than  civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least  people have been killed, including  children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. It comes as Ukraineaposs President accused Russia of aposstate terrorismapos on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.  The prisoner of war added: For those who would watch this video: you might think about me whatever you want, that I was forced, intimidated or the text was prepared in advance, whatever. Iaposll give it to you straight. If someone came to my territory I would do the same [as these] people did.  They[said] aposwe didnapost call you here…I feel shame that we came to this country.“I feel sorry for people left in Russia …they are not guilty. Their guilt is that they are misinformed.Some do not even have internet. They have no chance to use something alternative. They are constantly brain-washed. They get this unilateral information that Ukraine is seized by fascists.Earlier in the war another capturedRussiansoldier begged his mum to tell people the truth about theUkraineinvasion in a heartbreaking phone call.The POW was seen crying as he described how Vladimir Putinaposs forces had bombed kindergartens andhospitals .He told his mum to spread the word of what is really going on back home - where government propaganda is re. In the footage, the soldier is seen rocking back and forth in his chair during the video call. He tells his mum to use social media so as many people as possible know what the Kremlin attacks look like.

Parents Lauren and Matt, both , learnt of their daughteraposs complex congenital heart defect while she was still in the womb and stayed by her side as she spent the first year of her le undergoing two more open-heart surgeries.The le-saving procedures have left her with a deep downward scar in the middle of her chest, which her parents Lauren and Matt have dubbed her zipper due to it being opened and closed so many times.In the sweetest display of solidarity with his daughter, Matt – who had never been inked before – decided to get a tattoo of an open-heart surgery scar that was identical to Everlyaposs so that they could be zipper buddies for le. Insurance salesmen Matt, from Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA, said: Neither my we or I had ever got a tattoo before, or even really thought about it. It all started because I began noticing Everly was noticing her zipper scar a lot more than usual and was making many comments about it. I realised that she was starting to feel dferent, as there is not a whole lot of representation of scars, especially her type, out there. I just randomly said one day, aposyou know what, Iaposm going to get a tattoo to match her.apos  It was kind of just one of those things you say in passing, and I didnapost think much more about it. But then at Christmas , Laurenaposs parents surprised me with a gt card for a local tattoo artist near us. I was so touched by the gesture. Matt booked a consultation and thought he would go back in a week or two to get his tattoo but the artist had a cancellation. He added: So, all of a sudden, Iaposm getting the tattoo and my we and kids had no idea it was happening right then. It was all just like it was meant to be. It hurt as it was right on the bone, but I was thinking about Evie the whole time. If she could go through everything she has at such a young age, I could get this done. Matt said he was not sure how his daughter would react to his new tattoo orshe would truly understand the meaning behind it.  But when he got home and showed it off, both Matt and Lauren were left in hysterics after she told her dad Youaposre copying me. Matt said: In true Evie fashion, the first thing she said was that I was copying her and was teasing me for it. She is certainly the boss around here and has no qualms about putting people in their place. But I could see how happy she was, and she then smiled and told me that I wanted to have a special heart like hers.Mum-of-two Lauren also got inked for the very first time with a special tribute to her daughteraposs condition - an EKG on her left arm to commemorate all she has been through. She said: Iaposm so incredibly proud of Evie. She has been through so much already and keeps positive throughout it all.She is a very happy little girl and doesnapost really know any dferent. She has no idea what it is like not to be tired all the time and be in and out of hospitals.Evie knows she is a little bit dferent, as she takes a lot more breaks than the other kids and does need to be carried or popped in her stroller at times. But we always said we will let her be as aposnormalapos as her body will allow. We did not fight this hard for this long for her to just be in bed and do nothing. She is a little fighter and surprises us every day with her strength.

The vibrant fourth-grader has also eagerly stated he wants to get a zipper tattoo just like his daddy to support his sis once he turns . Lauren added: Jack absolutely fell in love with his dadaposs tattoo and his first question was aposhow old do you have to be to get one apos He is adamant that he will also get one as soon as he turns . He wants to support his sister. He is the best big brother anyone could ask for and has been since day one. The parents are hoping to raise awareness of childhood congenital heart defects by sharing their inspiring story with the world. After putting a photo of the tattoo on social media, Matt and Lauren said they have been contacted by people from around the globe who have found solace in their story. Matt said: It has been amazing to receive so many positive comments from people all over telling us how our story has touched them. Many were saying how they have always been self-conscious or ashamed of their zipper scars, so seeing posts like these have been amazing. That is all we want to do. We want to help others like Evie feel less alone while also raising awareness of the condition. Lots of kids with CHD donapost make it past their first birthday and more do not make it past . We hope by raising awareness, it will also help increase funding for research to help save lives.

The harrowing image captures the terror faced by so many like her but also, the bravery shining through.While many women have taken up arms and are fighting for their country, others are simply fighting to stay alive. And as the onslaught continues, as the world marks International Women’s Day, Ukraine ’s mothers, daughters and sisters continue to show their strength and defiance.The journey ahead for this woman will be long as she escapes, with others from the town of Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, after days of heavy shelling. It is a journey many have already undertaken. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog here Mariia Yevdokymova says she has cried only once since the war began. For nine days, along with her mother, younger sister, father and -year-old great-grandmother, the third-year medical student from the historic port city of Odessa, held her nerve at home, determined to stay and face down the Russians. But with growing fears of an aerial bombardment of the city where she grew up, on Saturday the family, with the exception of Mariia’s father who has stayed behind to fight, made the treacherous journey to the border. “It has been dficult,” explains Mariia. “But we have to be strong. I have only cried once since the war began, when we got to Moldova. When we crossed the border and stopped hearing the bombs and the sirens. When we couldn’t hear those sounds any more I suddenly cried. I realised what had happened. Now though, I feel stronger again. I will be strong for my family and our country. Our future is very unclear but when all this is over, we will be back to rebuild.”As the world marks International Women’s Day, the strength of Mariia and the women of Ukraine has been breathtaking. The many stories of their acts of defiance, courage and compassion have brought people across the globe to a standstill, from the hundreds of thousands who have made exhausting and perilous journeys to bring their families to safety in bordering countries like Poland, Romania and Hungary, to the millions more striving to keep their loved ones safe at home as Russian shells and bullets rain down.As Russian authorities clamp down on information, outlawing the very use of the word war in relation to their barbaric invasion of their next-door neighbour, Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenskais fighting to make sure ordinary people in Russia learn the truth. In a powerful post to her . million Instagram followers as she shared heartbreaking pictures of Ukrainian children who have been killed in attacks, she wrote: “When people in Russia say that their troops are not hurting the civilian population, show them these pictures! Show them the faces of these children who weren’t even given a chance to grow up.” She added: “Show these photos to Russian women - your husbands, brothers, compatriots are killing Ukrainian children!” Right across the country and from many walks of le, women have taken up arms, bolstering the tens of thousands already working with Ukraine’s armed forces. MP Kira Rudik tweeted a picture of herself holding a Kalashnikov the day after war broke out. “I’m so angry right now,” she later said. “I’m a woman, I have to bear arms and fight the tyrannies of those who want to take what is ours. When you are very angry, there is no place for the fear, I will be afraid afterwards. Right now I will have to get very strong, train and make sure that we have all of the supplies we need.” Fellow MP Lesia Vasylenko, whose three children have been evacuated from their home in the capital Kyiv, told how she kept her weapon with her at all times, saying: “I sleep with it, I work with it, I go to the bathroom with it, do I have a choice  No I don’t have a choice.” Beauty Queen Anastasia Lenna, who represented her country in the  Miss Grand International beauty contest, has also signed up to fight. She wrote on her Instagram page: “Nobody can stop new le! Nobody can stop us! Every day our woman bring new babies. Our nation is powerful and strong! I dedicate my time to volunteering for my country.” And while many have made their way out of Ukraine to safety, others have made their way back to join the fight.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Mother-of-two Yulia Peliukh-Korniichuk, who along with her husband moved to the Czech Republic in January for work, leaving their children in Ukraine with family, ed last week. “I want to see my children,” said Yulia. “I want to see my mother.” And while she vowed to take up arms to fight for her country, Yulia said conflict was not what she wanted. “I want peace,” she said. “I don’t want war... I don’t want to die our soldiers , our Ukrainian soldiers. They are very brave. And also Ukrainian women are brave with them and I think that we will be OK. We will win.”Preparations to fight were underway even before Russia’s invasion, with -year-old Valentyna Konstantynovska from Mariupol attending military training earlier in February. Valentyna, who was taught how to use an AK- assault rle by the Ukrainian national guard, said: “I’m ready to shootsomething happens. I will defend my home, my city, my children.” Grandmother Raisa Smatko showed her support for the defence effort by preparing Molotov cocktails for the fighters. The retired economist said she was prepared to defend her part of Kyiv district against invaders, saying: “We are ready to greet them.” With people using any and all means available to fight back against the Russians, Liubov Tsybulska, an advisor to the Ukranian government, reported that a woman had managed to bring down a Russian drone with a jar of pickled cucumbers launched from her balcony. “Ukrainian women are strong and resourceful,” says Mariia. “Partly because of our Soviet Union past, where everyone had to work, it’s very common for Ukrainian women to be the matriarch, the leader in their family. Throughout my le I’ve been told to be strong and to work hard to succeed. We are tough, and all that will pay off for us. We are especially tough now.” They are compassionate too.Nataliya Ableyeva, , brought a stranger’s children to safety in Hungary where they were reunited with their mother after border guards stopped their father from leaving Ukraine. “Their father simply handed over the two kids to me, and trusted me, giving me their passports to bring them over,” she said. Helping where of course are the emergency services, risking their lives to help both fighters and civilians. Paramedic Valentyna Pushych paid the ultimate price when she was shot on her way to evacuate injured people from the outskirts of the capital. She was buried on Saturday. Doctor Marina Kalabina was killed last week when her car came under fire as she took her wounded nephew to a hospital in the village of Kukhari in Kyiv.And as Ukraine’s brave women each play their part, for now Mariia, whose great-grandmother lived through World War Two, is focused on her family and hopes to reach out soon to her young students still living under threat from Russia. “We are all doing our best to support one another,” says Mariia. “Before we left Ukraine my family and I cooked broth and pies for the territorial defence and brought them clothes and blankets, whatever we could find to help. We have now left as things were getting so dangerous, but many of my students have stayed in Odessa. Last week I ran an online English class for them as a distraction from everything that was going on. It helped. Once I have secure internet again I will try to pick that up again. We need to stay focused and strong and remember who we are. Ukraine will come through this, soon I hope, and we have to be ready.” A sense of Ukraine’s extraordinary spirit of strength and defiance was conveyed on day one of the war when footage of a woman walking fearlessly towards a heavily armed Russian soldier was shared on social media s around the world, as she demanded to know: “What the f*** are you doing in our land with all these guns ” calling Russian troops “occupiers” and “enemies”. Stunned onlookers filmed as she fearlessly confronted the soldier in the port city of Henichesk, berating him as he and others tried to talk her down. Using the powerful symbol of her country’s national flower as she challenged him, she said: “Take these seeds and put them in your pockets so at least sunflowers will grow when you all lie down here.” That remarkable courage has carried on ever since, with President Zelensky’s we Olena last week reflecting Ukraine’s dignity and unstoppable fighting spirit as she addressed her two million followers on Instagram. “Today I will not have panic and tears,” she wrote. “I will be calm and confident. My children are looking at me. I will be next to them. And next to my husband.

The United Nations has formally acknowledged the day since  as a recognition of the struggle for womenaposs rights.The UN said: The year  is pivotal for achieving gender equality in the context of climate change, and environmental and disaster risk reduction, which are some of the greatest global challenges of the twenty-first century. Without gender equality today, a sustainable future, and an equal future, remains beyond our reach. It estimates that % of the . billion people living in conditions of poverty are women. Over the years, feminist movements have drawn attention to the need to redress the balance both within the workplace, socially, and in terms of how we think about the recognition of womenaposs contribution to the furthering of our society. Radical developments in engineering, science and general appliances have dramatically changed the face of the world we live in, but many would argue they are not as well recognised as they should be. Often, some of the best inventions go unnoticed, despite their use in our everyday lives. Who invented Kevlar   Kevlar was invented by Stephanie L. Kwolek, a Delware-based chemist. The material is used in bulletproof vests and other protective equipment, with its main features being that it is both light and strong.  It has saved countless lives over the years and is familiar to war reporters and soldiers. Kowelek patented the process of making Kevlar in . Who was Bessie Blount Grfin   The brilliant Bessie Blount Grfin was an American physical therapist known for working with soldiers during the first world war and inventing the feeding tube. Many soldiers became amputees due to the fighting and Blount noticed that much of the equipment was poor or inadequate. In her therapies, she taught amputees alternative ways of using their limbs, including people who lost their arms learning to use their mouths to write and their feet for general tasks.  Her invention of the feeding tube stands out the most, however, and meant that a tube inserted into the patientaposs mouth allowed them to eat independently and comfortably. Her aposportable receptacle support” was patented in  and the rights were bought by the French government one year later.After this, Blount went on to invent a disposable cardboard vomit basin, still standard in Belgian hospitals today according to Black Past.The History website argues she may well have been the first black woman to train at Scotland Yard’s Document Division, after moving into a career in forensics. Who was Ada Lovelace and what did she invent   The first computer algorithm is credited to pioneer mathematician Ada Lovelace. The daughter of poet Lord Byron, Ada built on the work by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea to formulate a code so elaborate and with such great depth that she is referred to as “the first computer programmer”.  Mathematician Anna Sfert from the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics said: If Ada had not written the first computer programme, someone  would have done it. The signicance of her work lies in the fact that she was the first to do so - a century before the invention of the computer. One-handed syringe  Letitia Mumford Greer patented the use of a one-handed syringe. Before this, a two-handed syringe was widely used by physicians.As the world continued to fight the coronavirus pandemic with a syringe or two, her invention was ahead of its time. The syringe did not initially become widely used when it was invented, as most drugs could not be injected, but the inventionaposs relevance grew and grew.Who invented the retractable dog leash  For people who have not had to follow their dog into the bushes to be greeted with all manner of unwanted substances, they can thank inventor Mary A.

Ukrainian politician Anton Herashchenko, advisor at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, shared translations of the phone calls online. It comes after captured Russian troops complained about being deceived by Putin in a string of videos released by Ukraine. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog here  In one intercepted conversation shared by Mr Herashchenko, a Russian soldier reportedly moans: We have no aviation, no f***ing support, we are like cannon fodder. According to the Sun, he added that he would do anything to come back home... resign from the army, I donapost give a f***. The soldier revealed that his comrades were looking forward to the end of the war as fighting for no reason had f***ed everyone up.  In another leaked recording, a Russian infantryman complained that his battalion was facing massacres and said his comrades were shaking, afraid and refusing to fight.A third soldier called his we, it is claimed, and told her:Russia itself attacked Ukraine, why I donapost understand. Weaposre definitely here until May, thataposs for certain.He warned the war could drag on for a couple of years.  Another Russian fighter said he was being paid £ a day - a relatively high wage in Russia - but said no-one cared about the money anymore. He echoed other soldiersapos wishes to quit the army and said his comrades were sleeping in the street. Weaposre running out of diesel fuel, ammunition level is low too. I donapost know what the f*** weaposre going to do, he added.  Russian forces have lost , troops a-day to a ferocious defence from Ukrainian troops and defiant citizen warriors, according to official Ukrainian numbers. The loss of , soldiers, sailors and airmen by day  of the invasion has been a massive blow to Moscow, which is now calling up reserves. Defence experts usually calculate invading commanders usually need an advantage in numbers of around three to one to attack a defending force.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter In house to house combat in inner cities, which is what Moscow is attempting, this calculation can be as many as four to one needed.It is estimated that Russia began the invasion with around , troops, in Belarus to the north, on the eastern flank and offshore in the Black Sea.  That is only a few thousand more than Ukraine ’s entire armed forces, it is believed, but the defenders were better-trained.And by adopting a full-on assault offensive on towns and cities that are well defended by a well-motivated force the Russian troops are now mired in urban combat.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

The only way to keep Scotland safe from Tory cuts is to become an independent country, with the full powers needed to build a fairer society."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils prepare for league matches","story":"Kick off is at pm.The Pupils will be hoping to continue their away day joy from two weeks ago when they secured a - victory at Glenvale.The Pupils then have another away trip scheduled the following Saturday, February , against St Peter#s in Renfrew.Then, the Pupils# conclusion to their league season sees them play four home matches in a row.For more information on everything from fixture information and matchday photography to club fundraising and the upgrades to Kintyre Park, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter and Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 18 2022","story":"Instinctively, I would answer: #Doubt.#But is that right  The opposite of faith is surely not doubt, but certainty. If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"oban golfer bob shines in californian sun","story":"With  top  world-ranking players in the field, the honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member was going head-to-head with the one of the strongest fields assembled outside a major championship.Having shown signicant signs of ato form in his previous two tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, this was a chance for the left hander to build on his progress and climb back towards the top  in the world rankings.An opening level par  on Thursday left Bob in the middle of the pack after day one.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to

private in the Argylls.He was mobilised to France and was at Dunkirk and, after ing to the UK, was later mobilised to North Africa where he was awarded the Military Medal at the Battle of Longstop Hill. He was commissioned in the field in Africa.Later advancing through Italy, Germany and Austria, he ended his service in an Austrian town called Dolsech, after which his home in Campbeltown is named.During discussions on his war service with Lt Col Donald Ross OBE and Col Robert Steele, it became apparent that he had not been awarded the Territorial Decoration to which he was entitled.The army medals office was approached and it was agreed MajMcMillan should receive this honour and he was awarded the Territorial Medal in the Queen’s New Year’s Honours List.At a ceremony last week, his family joined him, including son James who travelled from Canada to witness the medal presentation at the former RAF airbase at Machrihanish.Major McMillan said: #I am delighted to see some of my oldest friends here and as well as receiving this medal, it has made my day.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOIslay’s Ardbeg Distillery has been bought by Glenmorangie plc for £ million.Allied Domecq plc, which owned Ardbeg Distillery, will receive £ million of the total sum in tranches within the next three years.The sale includes the Ardbeg brand, the distillery and surrounding land as well as the stock profile which will come on stream as Ardbeg -year-old and -year-old stocks mature.It will signicantly strengthen Glenmorangie’s current portfolio of malt whiskies which include Glenmorangie and Glen Moray and will provide excellent potential for new brand development, utilising the company’s proven experience in premium brand management.Commenting on the acquisition, Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of Glenmorangie plc, said: #The company has made signicant progress since the introduction of a new strategy in .#We are particularly confident that our existing portfolio will continue to deliver above average growth and we wish to exploit our marketing capability to achieve a similar success rate with this Islay malt.#An opportunity such as Ardbeg, in a segment of the market which remains under developed, provides us with a rare opportunity.#Glenmorangie is well positioned in the Scotch whisky market, with a strong presence in the malt sector which grew by . per cent in the year to October  in export markets and by  per cent from January to October .FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Lachlan McKinnon, the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist officer, this week reported bumper bookings for the coming season.Talking to a Courier man, Mr McKinnon said that there had been a tremendous boom in the self-catering type of holiday.In fact, the association’s list of cottages, chalets and so on has become exhausted with the result that the months of June, July, August up until the middle of September are fully booked.A total of , enquiries were dealt with in the association’s Campbeltown headquarters by the end of February, an increase of  on last year.Mr McKinnon said he hoped the upward trend in self-catering holidays would continue further and preparations would be made to meet with the demand.It is hoped that the Arran-Kintyre ferry service proposed for this summer will be successful.Mr McKinnon’s plan is to bombard the landing jetty at Claonaig with advertising literature in an attempt to induce motorists south to Campbeltown.He feels strongly that the local authority, hoteliers and businessmen should spend more on advertising nationally in an all-out effort to attract tourism to the burgh.‘Unfortunately the tourist association does not have the money to advertise a specic place. We can only advertise the whole area, which is very large,’ he explained.‘But a town of this size could do a lot more in the way of advertising.’The caravan sites around Campbeltown are among the best

they were working, was unsafe.However, an inspector of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, who made a thorough inspection of the colliery on Thursday, on the recommendation of the manager Mr James W

too much coal was being extracted from the section concerned and expressed their fear that it might lead to a major disaster.Mr William Marshall, president of the Argyll branch of the NUM and one of the men involved, denied that the two men who originally stopped work because of the alleged danger were men of little mining experience.He stated that one of these men had  years’ experience in mining in the Blantyre district, while the other man had  years’ experience in another Scottish mining area.He argued that on several occasions the men had to quit the road because of creaking and

of washing through its new laundry service, after moving its headquarters from a former retail shop on Longrow to a unit at Snipefield Industrial Estate.The new Launder-Aide venture offers a same-day laundry and ironing service, with pick-up and delivery included.‘We had been looking for new premises for some time and the unit has everything we need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand books and other items.The importance of Shopper-Aide has been highlighted during the Covid pandemic, with its outstanding work in the community earning it a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service, the UK#s highest award for volunteers.During the first lockdown, the charity’s shopping client-base more than doubled, but an influx of volunteers who were unable to work due to Covid restrictions supported the charity to cope with the increased demand.Volunteers also helped Shopper-Aide to continue providing entertainment to older people throughout lockdown, despite not being able to hold its regular groups, by organising virtual afternoon teas and quizzes and a poetry competition.A ‘Phone Buddies’ system was also set-up, offering one-to-one phone-calls to clients.The charity encouraged its clients to knit squares as part of its ‘lockdown blankets’ project.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

Better Together won the campaign, but Labour lost the war – Johan Lamont quit, citing “a branch office of London”, and ushering in the Jim Murphy era and electoral disaster.But Mr Smith is correct, the next referendum will be dferent. The last  years have shown us that a “third option” is no longer believable. If Labour runs with this ticket, it will need to answer what powers any constitutional bill would contain how it would get them through Westminster how those powers would be entrenched against usurpation , by a Supreme Court and a Westminster which considers each new parliament as “sovereign”, and not bound by the previous one.Scotland being independent would obviously not solve any of “the big questions the world is challenged by”, but a new democratic country emerging is surely a global plus, and a poke in the eye for the despots and autocrats.GR Weir, Ochiltree.PUTIN WOULD HAVE WANTED YES WINTHERE has been some debate in your columns as to whether Vladimir Putin would have been supportive or otherwise towards the Yes campaign for Scottish independence .I would have thought that the facts that President Putin was engaged in  in an arms race with the West and that, at about the same time, the then Scottish Government issued a draft constitution for an independent Scotland which, at clause , compelled the anticipated independent Scottish government to effect “the safe and expeditious removal from the territory of Scotland of nuclear weapons based there” were salient to that debate.It would appear to have been logical, rational and even inevitable that Mr Putin would have wished for the success of the Yes campaign to secure that constitution for Scotland. Whether or not he would ever have gone to the s of interfering with another’s nation’s internal affairs is another matter but recent events indicate a willingness to do so.Michael Sheridan, by Strachur, Argyll.KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROADI SEE that Nicola Sturgeon has sent Ian Blackford out to deliver bad news to their followers: that they should focus on the Ukraine crisis and not expect a referendum in the short term . In truth there was never going to be a referendum in , Ms Sturgeon’s proclaimed favoured date. Some former SNP high-profile bloggers have abandoned that illusion to the extent of ceasing their campaigning activity.We already knew that Ms Sturgeon was merely kicking the can down the road by announcing a vote in . She cannot hold a legitimate referendum without the transfer of authority for one, with a Section  order, from the UK Prime Minister, who has steadfastly refused to provide one. She could hold an unauthorised referendum, but that would raise questions, probably legal questions, about the co-operation of local authorities with premises and staffing for such an event. An unauthorised referendum would not be recognised by other countries or international organisations.Ms Sturgeon had already indicated that she was not planning to hold a referendum by having no mention of it in the recent -year SNP economic plan that isnt really a plan which was announced by Kate Forbes. Why would an SNP economic plan make provision for the next  years without discussing the circumstances of a separate Scotlandthe objective was to hold a referendum in that period Ms Sturgeon’s followers are left wondering what a devolved \"focus on Ukraine\" is and why that stymies their dream.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.SECOND N-BOMB WOULD BE POINTLESSON BBC Radio s Any Questions at the weekend, from Penicuik, the second question was from one Thomas, who sounded very young, who asked the  a very pertinent and searching question. If Mr Putin deploys a \"tactical\" nuclear weapon, how should Nato respond  Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said he was going to dodge that question. As a Cabinet minister, he clearly doesnt wish Mr Putin to know the Wests game plan. Then he added, I thought with infinite condescension: \"But dont worry. You can sleep peacefully at night, because the nuclear deterrent is protecting you.\"But on Radio s A Point of View on Sunday morning, with respect to the deterrent, the writer Will Self did not share Mr Jacks equanimity. He made reference to Nevil Shutes apocalyptic vision of the end of the world, On the Beach, in which radioactive fallout destroys all le on Earth. He told us to be afraid, very afraid. I wonder what would have happened , when the Russians shelled Europes biggest nuclear power station at Zaporizhazhia, they had breached the reactors  Presumably the invading forces would have had no choice but to evacuate the theatre of war. It would have been a catastrophe for both Europe and Russia, but it is sobering to reflect that such an event might not be the worst-case scenario. At least it could have been spun as an \"accident\". Deployment of a \"tactical\" nuclear weapon, on the other hand, would be deliberate, and would predicate, according to the deterrent doctrine, a reprisal. And then we find ourselves on Nevil Shutes beach.I wish Mr Jack had said to his young inquisitor, \"Well,Mr Putin explodes a nuclear bomb, he will have demonstrated that the nuclear deterrent doesnt work. So what would be the point in exploding another one \"Dr Hamish Maclaren, Stirling.DETERRENCE DOES WORKIAN Blackford claims that nuclear weapons should be removed because they are not a deterrentbut this familiar SNP talking point has just been proven wrong, by Vladimir Putin himself.After all, Nato is refusing to escalate and establish the Ukranian no-fly zone or provide more active support that suffering Ukrainians and President Zelensky have been so desperately requesting specically because we have been effectively intimidated by Mr Putins threats of nuclear retaliation.Nuclear deterrence demonstrably works – all too well – and while it binds our hands in the tragedy of Ukraine it also protects the other smaller nations formerly dominated by Russia. Recent events do not discredit nuclear defence, but show why we need it to limit Russian aggression.Robert Frazer, Dundee.* IN half a sentence, when Vladimir Putin alluded to the terrible consequences that could emanate from outside interference in his plans for Ukraine, any argument that nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent to war was immediately and unequivocally destroyed.The argument is based on the logic that nobody wants mutually assured destruction, assuming that everyone, everywhere, in all circumstances, will act logically. As we are now witnessing, all it takes is one powerful inidual to buck the norm and we are on the brink of global disaster. Worse, logic then suggests thatan egocentric inidual like President Putin feels cornered by subsequent resistance, he may actually have nothing to lose by unleashing all his power on his perceived enemies.Andhe does, do we retaliate and unleash our own, on millions of innocent people unfortunate enough to have someone like Mr Putin in charge of their country  That too would be criminal.The only way to avoid a potential nuclear war is for no country to have nuclear weapons, full stop. Hopefully, it is not yet too late to learn the lesson.Liam Kane, East Kilbride.NATO MUST DO THE RIGHT THINGON Sunday , American Express joined the growing corporate boycott of Russia and issued the exemplary statement that one of its core values is “to do what is right\". Nato should pay heed. Rather than reciting ad nauseam the mealy-mouthed mantra that Ukraine is not a Nato member, the western allies should adopt the same laudable approach as AmEx and impose humanitarian no-fly zones in support of evacuation corridors. Otherwise, in a long drawn-out conflict, Nato is condemning thousands of innocent civilians and fleeing refugees to their death in the coming months.Ian Forbes, Glasgow.Read more: Dont blame Nato or Brexit for Putins evil"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-exploding-myths-around-creation-scottish-parliament-holyrood","story":"Unfortunately he has been misinformed about the background to its construction, making much of the rest of the article seriously misleading. It is important to remember that at the time of its construction the project became a political football, with many half-truths and untruths being published , to create a mythic fantasy.I will not comment point by point on Mr Grindrod’s misapprehensions, but feel that I should correct some of these. For a start, he does not seem to appreciate that Donald Dewar’s aspiration was to create a building of such presence and status that it would embody the vision of an inclusive parliament, worthy of all of Scotland. For instance, the chamber was designed to be non-confrontational, and the committee rooms to emphasise the roles of committees.Mr Grindrod, like many before him, makes much of escalating costs. Dewar,I remember correctly, said that a parliament building could be built for about £ million. This was never a budget figure, and merely represented possible costs for very basic accommodation. The architectural competition was to choose a designer, not a design. The short-listed candidates were not those quoted by Mr Grindrod, and when the interviews were heldthe Miralles Tagliabuie submission was unanimously agreed by the jury to be the best. Alone among the competitors this practice understood not only Dewar’s vision, but also the opportunity offered by the setting.Mr Grindrod is completely wrong in suggesting that Miralles had \"gone rogue and suggested a new location at Holyrood\". Originally three sites had been considered , and feasibility studies prepared. At a late date the Holyrood site became available. After a rapid feasibility study had been completed, Dewar chose this site for a iety of reasons, notably security. This was the site for which all the short-listed firms prepared their entries. The site had not, however, as suggested by Mr Grindrod, \"once been the garden of Queensberry House\", though that house and its garden were part of it most of it had been a brewery and brewery offices.Mr Grindrod also refers to the competition as \"this most conservative of competitions\" and asks why it was won by \"what seemed a fundamentally bonkers piece of magical thinking\". The competition was in no sense \"conservative\": it was about creating a new and inspiring home for a radically new parliament. The EMBT entry clearly addressed the client’s needs as set out in the brief, and in addition interacted successfully with the outstanding built and natural environments of the site.Finally, the new Wembley Stadium, completed soon after the Holyrood building, cost considerably more..John R Hume, Glasgow.KNIGHT-TIME ESCAPADESGAVIN Williamson’s knighthood Letters, March , along with the preposterous peerage of KGB agents son Evgeny Lebedev, and the many tax exile Tory benefactors, have all, once again, highlighted the absurdity of the honours system.While changing this discredited system requires time, money and legislation, it can quite easily be demolished overnight, and without cost, by each of us simply awarding ourselves a title.There is nothing illegal in calling yourself \"Sir\" providing you are not doing so with the intention to defraud, and the English rugby player \"Sir\" Brian Moore has already shown us the way, on Twitter.I awarded myself a knighthood last year, initially to establish whether the many bars, cafes and restaurants, who were obliged to collect our personal data for Covid tracing purposes, were complying with data protection laws. As it turned out, many were not, and my title is now widely disseminated. I now frequently receive advertising material using my title.When the whole country has a title of some sort, the system will be quickly and thoroughly discredited.In the meantime, as my own knighthood has been so devalued by the appointment of Gavin Williamson to our number, I believe it’s time to award myself an upgrade. \"His Serene Highness\" has a nice ring to it, don’t you think  Sir William Keil, Edinburgh.SNEAKY WAY TO RAISE PRICESI RECENTLY ordered, online from Sainsburys, a couple of g tins of my favourite Nestlé coffee which is normally priced at £ per tin. Often I will buy it when it is on reduced price of £ so that I can have a small stock of tins to hand when needed.Looking in my food cupboard the other day I happened to notice that the newer tins were a slightly dferent size from the older ones and, on checking the label, it now reads g – ergo a  per cent reduction at the same original price. Now it may be that the new size was noted on the internet shopping page ,but you only click to order the item and dont necessarily check the details. I will check in future.Alastair J Douglas, Erskine.* CAN someone explain why, apart from blatant profiteering greed, two Shell garages in North Glasgow have their diesel at p and p per litre when a trip to Devon and back over the weekend never saw it much above p and I was able to fill up on Sunday morning at .p litre  There is even a Shell garage in Kirkintilloch with lowish prices.Needless to say, they have lost this customer.Douglas Jardine, Bishopbriggs.CENSUS  WHAT A JOB IT ISNOTING Russell Smiths wry comments on the Census questionsI would add that both my we and I had no hesitation in answering \"Yes\" when askedwe would be able to accept an offer to start a new job in two weeks time.

I have lived with the trauma of reporting an assault, of navigating a crumbling criminal justice system, but my focus is now on the teaching and practice of consent. For this International Women’s Day, you will find me planning creative workshops with other survivors in my neighbourhood of Govanhill, collaborating on research about dferent intersecting issues, and drafting teaching materials for S-S levels in Scottish schools.Sexual consent is not routinely taught in UK schools. A better understanding of consent encourages active communication, respectful boundary-making, and a thoughtful approach to interactions with peers. In teaching children to care for themselves, to respect their own bodily integrity and personal autonomy, we cannot forget to teach them that – for a successful society - this care must be interdependent, it must extend to how we approach and relate to others.As a survivor, my experiences will have changed me, forever.

They are Edinburgh duo Marshall Sykes [second-row] and Nick Haining [back-row], and Glasgow trio Oli Kebble [prop], Ollie Smith [full-back] and Rufus McLean [wing]. Stand-off Hastings was a surprise omission from the initial training squad when it was announced in mid-January, with head coach Gregor Townsend insisting at the time that selection had been based on club form. The -year-old marshalled Gloucester to a bonus-point win over Northampton Saints on Saturday and assistant coach Pieter de Villiers insisted that he is has not been brought into camp just to make up the numbers. Finn Russell – as one of the few genuinely world class players in the squad – remains first choice stand-off, but he hasn’t hit his best for yet during this championship, so the Scotland selection  may take the view that Saturday’s game against an Italian side who have not tasted victory in this competition since  is the ideal opportunity to freshen things up. “Nobody is un-droppable,” stressed assistant coach Pieter de Villiers yesterday. “It is important to keep competition going and to reward players who get back to their strengths.  “We want to build continuity, but we also want to reward some people, to add to our depth and keep players believing.  “I think the competition is of a high standard at the moment and it is great to see Adam back in great form for his club,” he added. “He is happy to be back in the Scotland squad and we are very happy to see him here, so hopefully there are opportunities coming. “It is important for to keep players on form involved and reward them for what they have been doing up until now well.” Hastings’ recall may also be related to the prospect of Duhan van der Merwe missing the Italian match through suspension. The winger was red carded after his forearm made contact with fellow Scotland squad member Kyle Rowe’s face during Saturday’s English Premiership match between Worcester Warriors and London Irish.  His disciplinary hearing is tonight at pm andhe is suspended then there is a good chance that Blair Kinghorn – who has been back-up stand-off during the first three rounds of tis Six Nations – will be redeployed on the wing, leaving Scotland short of options in the No  channel. Elsewhere, de Villiers indicated that Matt Fagerson is shaping up well for ato the side after not making the France match due to a foot injury. “He’s been training with the squad so I’m quietly optimistic,” said the scrum expert. De Villiers also revealed that -year-old prop Murphy Walker, who signed his first senior contract with Glasgow in January, will train with Scotland this week but will not be officially added to the squad. Italy’s recent record in the Six Nations might be poor, and Scotland are in desperate need of some positive energy following back-to-back losses against Wales and France, but de Villiers insisted that it would be foolish to make wholesale changes for the trip to Rome.  “It is a very dficult place to play – a very passionate place in terms of energy and people getting behind their team,” he reasoned.  “Italy see Scotland as a team they want to take a scalp from and we know that.  It has been very physical in the past in Rome.  “Italy might not always get the results, but they have a very physical team, so we need to take that battle on and get off to a good start.”  “We would obviously like to do better than in the past two games,” he added. “There were some disappointments there but there were some good lessons and growth opportunities. “We would like to be more balanced in our approach in terms of applying pressure and maintaining pressure.  “Finishing off opportunities is something that France did very well, and we did not do as well. “I think we are a better team than the results have shown in our games so far and we would like to prove it out on the pitch. We would have liked to start off better, but those things happen. It is a growth experience for us and an opportunity for us to grow as a team. It is very important for us to finish these last two games well.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grumblings-great-good-golf-never-cease---nick-rodger","story":"Unless you’re that village elder, you’ll know that Wordle is a daily, internet brain teaser which fiendishly invites you to guess a five-letter word in six attempts or fewer.In some ways, it’s a bit like deciphering the haverings of the Tuesday column, which can be an addictively infuriating head-scratcher that just about requires the code-breaking gumption of the celebrated cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park.So, let’s plough on with the weekly conundrum.GRUMBLING GOLFERS GET LITTLE SYMPATHYGiven all the palaver with the Saudi Super League recently, it was almost refreshing to get back to some sort of normality at the weekend. And by normality, I mean professional golfers moaning and groaning.As the final day of the Arnold Palmer Invitational at brutal Bay Hill unravelled, the background noise of wailing and whining was akin to the racket you’d get with an angle grinder performing an exorcism on a Banshee.Thick rough, a boisterous breeze and baked greens led to the kind of attritional battle that should’ve featured trenches and fixed bayonets. Rory McIlroy, who slithered out of contention over the weekend after opening with a , snapped a wedge in half and branded the whole thing “crazy golf” as he led the whingeing. This is the same McIlroy who poured scorn on The Renaissance course at the Scottish Open a couple of years ago for being “too easy.”Scottie Scheffler, meanwhile, wasn’t complaining as he kept his head while others lost theirs to win his second PGA Tour title in his last three events with a five-under tally.In an age when golfers at the top level have never had it so good, not many will have much sympathy for some of the pampered pontications. Players were grousing and carping when we had a -under winning total on the tour just a few weeks ago. Now, they’re grousing and carping when gritty pars are the order of the day and five-under wins.Birdie-fest or proper test  When it comes to course set-up, you’ll never please everybody.

There will, no doubt, be something to moan about, though.FERGUSON GETS LESSON IN SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKSNo lead is ever really big enough is it  Such is the nature of this fiercely fickle game, a commanding advantage can swtly become as brittle as the Dead Sea Scrolls in the time it takes you to utter the words, “the chasing pack is closing in.”Winning, at any level, ain’t easy. Bearsden’s Ewen Ferguson had performed with wonderful aplomb to forge a four shot lead heading into the final round of the Magical Kenya Open at the weekend. A maiden DP World Tour title, in just his th start on the main circuit, was in his grasp. And then it all went belly up.After closing with a  to fall back into a share of eighth, the -year-old admitted he found the pressure of leading hard to deal with. “I didn’t sleep much , just thinking about it, I couldn’t believe I was leading by four shots,” he said.In golf, it doesn’t take much for the doubts to start swirling around in the mind. This correspondent’s pessimistic outlook, for instance, tends to start the moment the dispenser at the driving range begins churning out a bucket of  balls.Leading a main tour event was uncharted territory for Ferguson and, at this level of the professional game, any fragility will be ruthlessly exposed. It’s an unforgiving business.The young Scot had three runners-up finishes on the second-tier Challenge Tour last season and has served a sturdy apprenticeship. His Kenyan disappointment will have been a sore one to stomach but, hopefully, he won’t dwell on it. In this school of extremely hard knocks, it’s all part of the valuable learning process.STATUS KO ROCKING ALL OVER THE WORLDYou know I said winning ain’t easy a few paragraphs ago  Well, forget that. With her victory in the LPGA Tour’s HSBC Women’s World Championship in Singapore, Ko Jin-young has now won six times in her last  starts. This latest success arrived in her first event for three months and the world No ’s figures are startling and record-busting. The -year-old from Korea has now posted  consecutive rounds in the s and  consecutive sub-par scores.In , she went on a run of  holes without a bogey, which is in stark contrast to those of us who can nonchalantly reel off -odd holes without a snf of a par.Her level of consistency in a game of capricious fortunes is quite staggering. With the women’s major season looming, one can only wonder what she will achieve. The golfing gods don’t dish out guarantees but it seems every time Ko tees-up she contends. Sustaining such remarkable standards will be dficult but, as her hot streak goes on, let’s just enjoy the ride."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-give-110-gift-cards-scotland-loves-local-plan","story":"Glasgow City Council is planning to spend more than £ million it received from the Scottish Government on giving out more than , cards worth £ each.It is intended the gt cards, through the Scotland Loves Local campaign, will give a multi-million-pound cash injection into the economy to boost city high streets and independent businesses.The cards can only be used in Scotland Loves Local businesses within the Glasgow boundary and almost  in the city are registered with the scheme.The council said it wanted to use the cash it has been given to help low-income families and businesses that have been hit by the lockdowns and pandemic restrictions.Susan Aitken, leader of the council, said in a report to councillors: “By using the Scotland Loves Local gt card scheme, it will provide cash to iniduals from low-income households by way of a gt card that can only be redeemed within the city boundary, providing the local business community with a much-needed cash injection over the next year.”The cards will be given out to low-income households who receive a council tax reduction benefit.Councillor Aitken added: “The Scotland Loves Local campaign is a national initiative designed to encourage those who live in Scotland to think local first and support their local high streets.“The outbreak of coronavirus has caused signicant challenges for towns and city centres, high streets and local businesses who have lost out on vital trade.“The Scotland Loves Local gt card is an innovative way of keeping spend local for longer in every community and region across Scotland.“The programme is designed so that these cards cannot be used out with the city boundary, ensuring the spend remains within Glasgow, benefitting local businesses.”There are , households in the city in bands A to G who get council tax reduction.It will cost up to £,, to give them all a £ gt card, with the rest being spent on admin costs and postage."},{"url":null,"title":"iwd-0-4-journalists-women-colour","story":"We have such a long way to go, particularly when it comes to genuine action and accountability of the racist and sexist abuse women of colour in public le face.

We need political parties to tackle sexism and racism within their structures, we need local councils to exist in a way where those with caring responsibilities can actually take part as decision makers, we need quotas so political parties have to field more women candidates and in media, we need to pay commentators adequately, we need to reach out beyond the known voices and create more space for new ones."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee-boss-mark-mcghee-looking-take-positive-step-st-mirren","story":"A win for the Dark Blues in their game in hand would take them off the bottom of the cinch Premiership and two points ahead of St Johnstone with eight league fixtures remaining.After starting his tenure as Dundee boss with two defeats then two draws, McGhee is looking to take the next step against the Buddies and outlined its signicance.“Any better than that would obviously be fantastic but this game is an opportunity the way I see it.

We have a fantastic and close working relationship and we share a commitment to maintain the high quality of the wines we produce.”Kylie’s Rosé is the most successful Rosé in the UK and now, following on from that success, Benchmark launched Gary Barlow’s range at the end of last year, as well as launching Gordon Ramsay Wines.“We also represent Graham Norton and Sarah Jessica Parker wines,” adds Madeleine. “We have the ideal  and an experienced team behind these brands.”Madeleine’s background is in fashion and retail and she quickly realised there was a gap in the market for fun but luxury gts surrounding the celebrity brands.She realised that there could be a direct connection with the people that were drinking the wines that they made. “So I started Wine Delivered at the end of the  and haven’t looked back,” said Madeleine.The entrepreneur also has four children, two girls and two boys, and says she enjoys the juggle between running a full-time business and looking after them.“Now they are a bit older, they don’t need as much attention which has allowed me to focus more on the business. I’m lucky as I can work from home, or the office where I have a small team. “I’m also lucky that I can be flexible with my hours so I can be there for my family when they need me. They have also supported me – my children can often be found in the warehouse helping me pack the hampers at busy times of the year like Christmas or Easter!”Wine Delivered has so many ideal Mother’s Day gts and for Madeleine it is always a special day.“I try to make sure all my children are at home and that we have a special lunch together to celebrate. We will start the day with a glass of Kylie Minogue’s or Graham Norton Prosecco and a enjoy a glass of Gary Barlow Organic Wine with some smoked salmon and Gordon Ramsay’s Rosso Intenso with Roast Lamb or Beef.”Onethe most popular Mother’s Day gts this year will be Kylie’s Prosecco Rosé and heart shaped biscuit gt pack.“It is so pretty and says thank you so clearly,” says Madeleine. “If your mother is a Gary Barlow fan then we have his Jute Bag with bottles of his organic wines and chocolate truffles.

Middle earners could spend a fth of their salary on rent in some areas, or nearly triple that in others.Median-priced flats in Edinburgh – the biggest and most unaffordable rental market – could consume  per cent of a local middle earner’s wage, or  per cent of a low earner’s wage.Campaigners and politicians said our investigation illustrates how unaffordable renting has become in Scotland’s “increasingly broken housing market”. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation stressed that a third of Scotland’s private renters – around , people – already live in poverty.Property experts confirmed that dwindling rental stock is increasing competition and pushing up rent prices as landlords sell up amidst record house prices.Nationwide data shared with The Ferret also shows that homes sold to first time buyers in Scotland last June cost, on average, . times the average national earnings. Since then, house prices have surged further.Developers, letting agents and landlords are making “insane” profits, argued the tenant’s union, Living Rent. The most recent accounts from housebuilders active in Scotland showed collective pre-tax profits of more than £bn.The Scottish Government said it had made a “clear commitment” to introducing rent caps in the current parliamentary term as part of its new deal for tenants consultation.But Scottish Labour warned of rents “spiralling out of control” with “record breaking increases”. Both Labour and Living Rent urged the government to introduce rent controls immediately.To get a picture of the rental market, The Ferret analysed , Scottish rental property listings advertised on  January via property search engine, Nestoria.In this snapshot, the average monthly rent was £, with two-bed properties the most common option. Renters could typically pay £ for a one-bed, £ for a two-bed, £ for a three-bed and £, for a four-bed.Comparing local earning statistics from the Office of National Statisticsagainst local rents showed that letting is most unaffordable in Edinburgh. For example, the capital’s median – or middle – earners could spend  per cent of their salary on the median rent, or  per cent on the cheapest.In Glasgow, median earners could lose  per cent of their earnings on median rents, or  per cent on the cheapest. Middle earners in East Lothian, Stirling and East Dunbartonshire could spend  per cent of their wages on the median rent, or - per cent on the cheapest.Comparatively, median earners in East Ayrshire or Renfrewshire could spend just  per cent of their salary on the median rent, or - per cent on the cheapest.Rents most unaffordable to the lowest paidFor Scotland’s lowest earners, even the cheapest local lets in some areas could consume the bulk of their salaries.Edinburgh’s lowest paid could lose  per cent of their earnings on renting one of the capitals cheapest properties. Renting a median-priced flat could consume  per cent.In East Lothian, low earners could spend  per cent of their wages on the cheapest rents, or  per cent on the median. The cheapest to median rent prices for low earners in Midlothian could take up - per cent of their wages, and - per cent in East Dunbartonshire.Rent was most affordable in Inverclyde, East Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire, where the cheapest to median lets ranged from  per cent to  per cent of the lowest wages.But these locations had just one per cent or less of all properties advertised on Nestoria. Many areas lacked rental homes, leaving renters with little choice of accommodation. We found no lets advertised in Shetland or the Western Isles.Some  per cent of listed lets were in Edinburgh,  per cent in Aberdeen and  per cent in Glasgow. Aberdeen’s cheapest flats could account for  per cent of the lowest income, while Glasgow’s could require  per cent.Other larger rental markets included Dundee, Perth and Kinross and Renfrewshire, where the cheapest rents could cost  per cent of the lowest local incomes, and South Lanarkshire, where they could take up  per cent.Call for rent controls as one third of renters in poverty“These stark figures lay bare the cost of the renting crisis that so many households are struggling with,” said Labour’s housing spokesperson, Mark Grfin MSP.“There is no time to waste while tenants are struggling to make ends meet in the middle of a cost of living crisis. The SNP must move forward with plans for rent controls as a matter of urgency, and alongside a real plan to fix Scotland’s increasingly broken housing market.”The Joseph Rowntree Foundationsaid: \"What this research illustrates is just how far the rents being asked for outstrip what those on modest incomes are likely to be able to afford.”While social security support is available, “we can demonstrate it simply isn’t enough to prevent hardship,\" said a JRF spokesperson. Young people, single parents and ethnic minority communities were among those most impacted, JRF said.Scotland needs a stronger affordable housing scheme, the spokesperson argued. A third of Scotland’s private renters – around , people – live in poverty, according to research from the JRF and others.Of these renters,  per cent were pushed into poverty by housing costs. “That’s , people who could be helped with effective action to lt incomes and reduce costs,” JRF added.Rufus Boverie of Living Rent said: “Up and down the country, we hear of tenants struggling and being driven into poverty by sky-high rents. These numbers just confirm our experiences and the need for the government to introduce real rent controls now.“Property developers, landlords and letting agents are making insane profits and reaping the benefits of the lack of regulation. Tenants cant afford another five years of rent hikes.”Tenants’ rights minister, Patrick Harvie MSP, said the government had provided £m in housing support this year, £m to avoid evictions due to the pandemic and was committed to introducing rent controls.“I am determined to put in place measures which are robust and which stand the test of time,” he said. The government would deliver , affordable homes over the next decade and had given councils the power to control short-term lets, which had led to loss of rented properties, added Harvie.Scotland’s biggest letting agentsThe Ferret also can also reveal that renters are being asked to outbid one another just to secure a home, further pushing up rents. Soon, “tenants may not be able to find anywhere to live regardless of cash” and the supply drought must be “tackled urgently”, warned the Scottish Association of Landlords.Research shows the continued rise of rents, although there is no consensus on the extent. ONS stats show that Scottish rents rose by . per cent in the year from January  to .The HomeLet Rental Index estimated that the average Scottish rent rose by . per cent over the same period, while CityLets last year reported average annual rises of . per cent.Scotland’s major letting agents include Yorkshire’s Lomond Group, which claimed to be Scotland’s largest agent, with , properties, after acquiring the Edinburgh-based ​​DJ Alexander in December. This was reportedly the group’s th acquisition in .Lomond Group – the result of its £m merger with Linley  Simpson last year – also owns agencies including Allen  Harris, Braemore, FineHolm, Stonehouse, Burnett and Reid, and Broughton.Both Slater Hogg and Howison, with  branches, and Aberdeen’s Aberdein Considine with  in Scotland and Northern England, also claim to be Scotlands largest agent. The former is ultimately owned by Yorkshire’s Skipton Building Society.Skipton announced profits of £m for the first half of , up £m on the same period a year earlier.Global real estate giant Re Max has  Scottish offices. Glasgow-based Clyde Property, which ​​has , claims to manage over , lets.Record house pricesHouse prices repeatedly reached new record highs over the last year. Halax said prices in Scotland rose . per cent over the year to the end of January. The continued rise would make barriers to ownership \"more acute”, it said.The average asking price in Scotland again rose by . per cent between January and February alone, according to Rightmove, which it attributed to the rise to housing shortages and buyers seeking to move house as Covid- restrictions ease.In January Nationwide released a study to gauge housing affordability in the UK. Its data, shared with The Ferret, shows that homes sold to first time buyers in Scotland in June cost, depending on the area, between . and . times the average local earnings.Banks will typically lend a customer intending to buy a property no more than . times their income. The customer would also need to cover a deposit of at least five per cent of the property’s value, and other fees.Housebuilder profitsDevelopers are also set to profit further as house prices soar. Most of the biggest housebuilders active in Scotland announced signicant annual profits in recent months, following a Covid- downturn.The upmarket Cala Homes, owned by a financial services firm, predicted record revenues of £.bn for , with its £m pre-tax profit up  per cent on its , pre-pandemic revenues.Some housebuilders bought out their rivals or were acquired by private equity firms. Edinburgh-based Miller Homes was bought by US equity giant Apollo Global Management in December.Elgin-based Springfield Properties’ £.m pre-tax profits for the year to the end of May were up  per cent on the previous year. It bought the Inverness-based Tulloch Homes for £.m in December.Conversely, Aberdeen’s Stewart Milne and Elgin’s Robertson Homes reportedly saw losses of £.m and £.m in  respectively.

Like countless others watching the invasion unfold on the news, from a position of safety, we are deeply moved and appeal for your urgency in introducing sanctions on Russian activity in the UK.#We appeal to you to take immediate action to address the activity of state-owned Russian vessels in UK waters at this time, in particular the activities by Sovcomflot oil tankers in the Northern Isles of Scotland. We are aware of the vessel NS Challenger, owned by Sovcomflot, which was permitted to take on cargo at Sullom Voe Oil terminal, in Shetland on the February .#Following the media statements from Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, another Sovcomflot vessel NS Champion has cancelled its berth in Scapa Flow, Orkney on the March , .#It is with our disappointment that sanctions were not imposed prior to this Sovcomflot activity in Shetland, however we hope that similar commercial activity in our waters is restricted in future.#We, the undersigned, fully support the UK Government extending sanctions to mody the obligations of Open Port Duty, Section  of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act , to be applied to the activity of Russian state-owned vessels and their use of UK ports.#Elected members of Orkney Islands Council, as the Orkney Harbour Authority, continue to uphold the Port Marine Safety Code and the obligations covered by the Pilotage Act .#The letter was signed by all  councillors. The amendment to UK sanctions came into force at pm this Tuesday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Standards we know we’re capable of reaching. Gotta go on a run now. 💪 pic EMOmEZ— Harry KaneMarch , Kane, who scored twice in the Everton defeat, has spoken atabout how much he is enjoying working under Conte and has called on his side to “take responsibility” and get back to “where we think the club should be”.He said: “The manager is a fantastic coach, I’ve said that now on many occasions.“I really enjoy working with him, so it’s down to us players to take that responsibility. A lot of us want to be playing in the Champions League.“We haven’t played in it now for a couple of years but it’s where we think the club should be.“So there’s a lot of hard work to go. It’s not just about one result because we’ve had good results like this, this season already.“It’s about putting together a run of four, five results in a row. Obviously we’ve got another tough game on Saturday .“If we want to move forward as a team, it’s about taking responsibility and we can’t hide away from it.“Obviously there’s  games left now so there’s still a lot of opportunity to pick up points and it’s just down to being more consistent. That’s what we’ve got to try to do until the end of the season.” vw,vw,px, px\"Kane scored a brace in Monday night’s five-goal victory over Everton Spurs’ chances will be enhancedKane can continue his recent form as he produced another dazzling two-goal display.After a slow start to the season, brought on by his summer transfer saga, Kane is producing the form that saw him win the Golden Boot and Playmaker award last year.His two goals against Everton moved him above Thierry Henry in the all-time list of Premier League goalscorers with  and ending the season could see him overtake Frank Lampard and Sergio Aguero and into the top four.Worryingly for Premier League defenders, Kane says he has more to give.All-time #PL scorers: – Alan Shearer – Wayne Rooney – Andrew Cole – Sergio Aguero – Frank Lampard – HARRY KANE – Thierry Henry pic HWaLMiw— Premier LeagueMarch , “I feel like I’m in a great place. I’m  now, I feel like physically I’m in a really good place,” he said.“I feel mentally, my game understanding and my awareness on the pitch is at a really high level from just gaining experience over the years.“Antonio has definitely given me more strings to my bow. I’m always someone who tries to improve. When I’m ,  I’ll still be trying to improve.“That’s just my mindset. But for sure, I’m in a good place.

What is the best way to save energy in our homes A. If your home isn’t yet insulated, then the best way to save money is to get your loft and your cavity walls insulated. You will soon recover the money spent and there may even be a grant available to help.After that, turning your thermostat down even by  degree Celsius can help save money — andyou need to, put on another layer of clothes to keep warm.Q. Does only filling a kettle with as much water to boil as you need really help A. Every small action helps and that includes only boiling the water you need in a kettle. Heating more water than you need means you are spending money unnecessarily.And it is also financially beneficial to heat water in a kettle and then add it to a pot, for exampleyou are boiling your potatoes, as a kettle is more efficient at heating water than many stoves.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate Change‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it went PremiumKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemBuzz words: net zero, a key way to tackle escalating climate changeFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Most ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two years‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant PlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksLatest Environment‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentMalachi O#DohertyOpinionA world in which bicycles are king is safer and healthierKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemSerial entrepreneur Mark Dowds: ‘I took lessons from my dad and applied them in a dferent era’LatestJoe Biden set to ban Russian oil imports over Ukraine warIncrease in borrowers remortgaging homes at end of Commissioner tells conference he wants to see more women join policeFormer Commons leader calls for Bercow to be expelled from Labour PartyMen must sing from ‘same hymn sheet’ as women, Rochelle Humes says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet. The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which are all natural, and fluorinated gases, which are synthetic. The UK currently has a target of reaching net zero by , while two climate change bills progressing through Stormont have two separate targets: one mirroring the UK’s target, and another aiming to reduce emissions by % by .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Climate Change‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it went PremiumKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemAsk the expert: How can energy be saved in our homes Friends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Most ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two years‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospitalTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant PlayUkraine war: Little girl sings #Let It Go# from Disney#s Frozen while sheltering in Kyiv bunkerLatest Environment‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentMalachi O#DohertyOpinionA world in which bicycles are king is safer and healthierKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemSerial entrepreneur Mark Dowds: ‘I took lessons from my dad and applied them in a dferent era’LatestTrain driver ‘sent message about Murray Walker death’ moments before crashEnvironmental activists let down tyres on ‘hundreds’ of SUVs across BritainWales set to reunite Josh Navidi and Taulupe Faletau in back row against FranceEurovision winner Jamala flees Ukraine while husband and family hide in KyivProcess to enter UK ‘taking ages’, says man trying to help family flee Ukraine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey pictured.March   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPoliticians are increasing recognising that immediate and decisive action on the climate crisis will not only influence votes — it will win votes.Indeed, for many Northern Irish voters, climate action will be one of the defining issues in the upcoming MLA elections in May.With these elections fast approaching, many candidates have already started leafleting and door-knocking. However, when a candidate knocks at your door, what questions should you ask them  More importantly, how do you know whether they are genuinely serious about what they propose To gain a deeper sense of the candidate’s knowledge and understanding of climate breakdown, begin the conversation in the context of the broader political landscape.There are currently two climate bills passing through the Northern Irish Assembly. These are subject to ongoing debates, reviews and amendments. Both bills have a target of net zero emissions. Yet while the Private Members’ Billaims for Northern Ireland to be net zero by , the Executive Billaims for .Read MoreClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsYou could therefore start by asking the following question: which bill do they support Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given how both bills aim for Northern Ireland to be net zero, despite ying target dates, a good follow-up question would be to ask how their party hopes to achieve this. How will they get us there  What is their political strategy  What concrete steps will they take to help Northern Ireland reach net zero Northern Ireland is not only the last nation in western Europe to implement climate legislation, but we also rank th worst in the world for bioersity loss. Nature recovery is therefore integral to an ambitious climate strategy.It is therefore crucial to ask the candidate about how they plan to halt and reverse nature and bioersity loss. How will they promote regenerative agricultural practices  How will they create more spaces for nature  How will they prevent the decline — and potential extinction — of our valuable species and wildle There are also three sectors in Northern Ireland which could be uniquely affected by the climate crisis: agriculture, energy and transport. These three sectors are vastly dferent. However, what unies questions regarding the future of these sectors is the principle of ‘just transition’.‘Just transition’ is the idea that we should not moveto a low-carbon, environmentally-friendly economyit means sacricing justice or ‘fairness’. A just transition recognises that, whether it be people on low incomes or workers in the fossil fuel industry, no one should be left behind in the creation of a ‘greener’ society.To take energy as an example, fossil fuels like oil and gas remain the primary source of heat and power in Northern Ireland. We already know that fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they will not help us to reach climate targets. Beyond asking candidate about renewable energy systems, we must therefore go one step further.We need to ask candidates about how they will compensate for workers in polluting industries, who may find themselves without a job in a more sustainable world. What incentive schemes will they promote  How will they re-train or upskill iniduals  How will government invest in this The same is true for agricultural and transport sectors. Will there be grants or public goods for farmers who dedicate areas of land to rewilding or regenerative practices  Will there be further investment in public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural communities  How will government incentivise citizens to support ‘greener’ lestyle choices that are typically more expensive, like buying an electric car or fitting solar  at home Lastly, ask the candidate seeking your vote about what is important to you.Whether it be plastic pollution or food waste, this is an invaluable opportunity for you to ask the candidate about a specic topic that you care deeply about. This could be an ongoing problem in your local area, or a global issue which causes you concern.Raising more personal questions with candidates may subsequently elicit a more direct response from them.Elections are a rare opportunity for citizens to shape environmental policy, and focus political attention on the most defining issue of our generation: the climate crisis.Climate change will be related to every social issue on each political party’s manesto – from gender equality to healthcare.Voting for candidates who support ambitious environmental policy solutions is therefore arguably the most important action that citizens can take.Remember this when candidates come calling.Related topicsEdwin PootsClare BaileyClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Edwin PootsFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Greens call for independent environmental agency in NI after Poots announces English office to extend its remit to Northern Ireland PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastEdwin Poots confirmed to replace Christopher Stalford for south Belfast seat PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsMost ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two years‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospitalTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant PlayUkraine war: Little girl sings #Let It Go# from Disney#s Frozen while sheltering in Kyiv bunkerLatest Environment‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentMalachi O#DohertyOpinionA world in which bicycles are king is safer and healthierKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemSerial entrepreneur Mark Dowds: ‘I took lessons from my dad and applied them in a dferent era’LatestUkrainians flee embattled city, but Russian shelling threatens second routeTruss faces demands to give EU an ‘absolute deadline’ over protocol issuesTrain driver ‘sent message about Murray Walker death’ moments before crashEnvironmental activists let down tyres on ‘hundreds’ of SUVs across BritainWales set to reunite Josh Navidi and Taulupe Faletau in back row against France,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But more compelling is the awareness of how, just a few years ago, all of this valuable material was just dumped into holes in the ground.It’s a filthy business, but far less filthy than the alternative of landfilling the contents of our bins.Anyone who has lived near a municipal dump knows the stench, flies and rats which follow. The toxic nature of much waste means the sites are contaminated for generations, threatening groundwater and wildle.And yet,we all dump our waste into black bins, these sites must go somewhere. It is hypocritical for someone who refuses to recycle to object to a landfill site simply because it is close to their home, rather than close to someone ’s.As recently as , every year we sent , tonnes of municipal waste to landfill by last year that had fallen by %, even though the population increased in that period.Not all the reduction is because of recycling. Just over a decade ago no household waste was incinerated, but now , tonnes are sent abroad each year to be burned to make electricity.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But recycling is the key explanation for the transformation. Driven both by legislative compulsion and growing public awareness of how we are polluting our world and wasting its resources, many people now put more into their recycling bin than into the black bin.Compostable and food waste is now collected separately and used for everything from garden compost to creating gas which can power lorries or make electricity.But what happens when the recyclable material leaves our homes  It is particularly hard to understand how the recyclable items put into blue bins or other comingled recycling bins — where all manner of materials are mixed — can be accurately sorted for processing.In an industrial estate in Mallusk, Bryson Recycling is where that process unfolds for much of the east of Northern Ireland. Bin lorries from five council areas — Belfast Antrim and Newtownabbey Ards and North Down Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid and East Antrim — arrive and leave in a constant stream.Mechanical rams push out each bin lorry’s contents into a hangar. A huge quarry shovel loads it onto a conveyor belt. Plastic bottles explode like fireworks as the vehicle’s heavy wheels drive over the material.The belt carries the waste into the deafening materials recycling facility . The process which follows is surprisingly labour-intensive, as well as using technology to separate the waste.First, a group of workers stand on a raised  and manually lt obvious contaminants from the conveyor belt.Secondly, the belt moves through screens designed to remove paper, which goes to a separate line.The third process involves a magnet that attracts steel cans, such as baked beans tins.That process is then reversed at the fourth stage as the remaining material is subjected to an eddy current that repels aluminium into a chute.The line splits into four conveyors which run through a sorting cabin — the fth stage — where a team of workers pick out materials by hand, aided by a prototype robot that recognises materials and lts then.The sixth stage sees plastics removed using optical sensors which recognise material based on how it reacts to light. A final process involves a worker again manually picking out recyclable items which have been missed.By this stage, more than % of the initial material has been removed. But it’s not perfect. I saw plastic bottles and paper dropping off the end after the final check.The conveyors move quickly and not even all the obviously recyclable material can be caught there is no time to explore items which look unclear. Small items such as bottle tops are particularly unlikely to be correctly identied, falling off the end of the line to be taken for incineration.There are two forms of contamination: material which is wrongly bundled together through the MRF-sorting process [such as plastic in bales of paper], and material which cannot be recycled at all at that facility and so is taken for burning.The contamination at the start of the process stems from a mixture of ignorance of ambiguous rules for what can be recycled in dferent council areas, and deliberate flouting of rules.Claire McCallum has been in the recycling business for two decades at Bryson. “We’ve probably seen nearly everything coming through the doors here,” she tells the Belfast .“We have an ongoing issue with nappies coming through, but also dead animals all sorts of things. We’ve had quite a lot of dead lambs.”Food waste in containers rots, both making the process of hand-sorting more unpleasant and contaminating the final material.What can the public do to help  “I think the best thing people can do is, rather than look at a certain type of material and think ‘oh, that can be recycled’, always check your local council website,” she says.“And the other thing is to ensure things are clean give them a quick rinse before recycling.”But the blue bin comingled recycling is only part of what happens at this facility. Bryson’s own-design vehicles move to another part of the site where no sorting is necessary because the materials have already been sorted manually as they were lted.It is this system Ms McCallum believes is the future.It produces far higher quality materials, almost % pure, rather than some plastic or metal inevitably ending up in a bale of paper. And it uses far less energy, unlike the vast electrical and mechanical demand of the MRF plant.There isn’t just an environmental benefit to the kerbside sorting. Counterintuitively, Bryson says it is also cheaper for ratepayers.“We have been looking at cost analysis and we have worked out thatevery household in Northern Ireland had wheelie boxes, it would save councils about £ million a year,” Ms McCallum says.The costs of sorting the material properly by hand are higher, but the processing costs signicantly less and produces materials which can be sold for a much higher price.So why were councils ever using blue bins  She suspects councils instinctively did so because they had been used to bins and bin lorries, and when told to recycle, they used what was familiar.When asked about this, a spokesman for Nilga, which represents councils here, said the issue was complex, but that the public should try to consume as little materials as possible and recycle the maximum quantity of what they do use.Bryson would like to see a single, consistent approach to recycling across Northern Ireland.Another benefit of improving the quality of recycled materials is that it makes it easier to sell to local firms and improves the quality of their products.Just % of MRF-sorted material stays on the island of Ireland for processing for kerbside-sorted material that figure is %.The high quality, low-contamination materials are not possible through an MRF facility, Ms McCallum says: “You can’t achieve that through recycling through a blue bin system.”Bryson’s plastic, paper and glass is recycled locally, supporting about  jobs and generating around £m a year.The paper is turned into moulded packaging like egg cartons and cup carriers by Huhtamäki in Dollingstown. Glass is melted in a Encirc’s furnace in Derrylin before being turned into bottles for Bailey’s, Bushmills, Fever-Tree, Bottlegreen and other leading drinks brands. Plastic is taken to Cherry Pipes in Dungannon where it is made into civil engineering and agricultural pipes.In one key area, Northern Ireland is now behind the Republic.Last year it became mandatory for recycling companies south of the border to accept ‘soft plastics’ such as the film lids to be recycled.Here that form of plastic makes up much of what still goes into landfill. It is not likely to be collected for recycling locally until .Dealing with waste is complex, but it can be over-complicated by government. For years, as the government prodded people to recycle and cut black bin collections, there was public grumbling.But public opinion has shted rapidly polling now finds public support for recycling.In the post-war decades it was a symbol of society’s growing wealth that a consumer could buy something new, use it for a while and then dump it in landfill because a newer model was available or a minor fault had developed. But that materialistic hedonism has become increasingly uncool.Now people want to recycle more, and do so more easily, but it is government that has not moved to satisfy this desire — either by not collecting basic items such as soft plastic or glass for recycling, or by using a system that will inevitably fail to recover a high percentage of what could be salvaged, and will inevitably contaminate even what is recycled.Stormont and our councils have the power to change this — but may only do sothey believe votes are at stake.Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate Change‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentBuzz words: net zero, a key way to tackle escalating climate changeAsk the expert: How can energy be saved in our homes Friends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Most ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two years‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant PlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksLatest Environment‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentMalachi O#DohertyOpinionA world in which bicycles are king is safer and healthierSerial entrepreneur Mark Dowds: ‘I took lessons from my dad and applied them in a dferent era’Andrew WebbOpinionTime to fix the climate at any cost LatestPeter Wilson is new No  principal private secretaryJoe Biden set to ban Russian oil imports over Ukraine warIncrease in borrowers remortgaging homes at end of Commissioner tells conference he wants to see more women join policeFormer Commons leader calls for Bercow to be expelled from Labour Party,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It also provides other specialist services. Its workload ranges from contracts worth over £m to inidual shop-fits, and its client base ranges from multinationals to smaller private clients.Clients of its fit-out services have included retailers like Hugo Boss and Swarovski.It posted revenues of £.m in , down from more than £m in , but in a dficult year. Its pre-tax profits increased to £,.The new arm will work with existing  —  and new  —  customers across Ireland and the UK to add renewable energy options while also working on construction projects with in built-plans for the use of renewables, including social housing projects here in Northern Ireland.Work will include new builds, refurbishments, modications, rewires and upgrades.Around  new people will come on board and most will receive specialised training.Steve maps out his vision of how Parr Renewables will fit in to the overall organisation. “It is not just about adding, for example, a solar element to the energy mix, though that is important —  it is much wider that that,”  says Steve.It is about the entire fabric of a building, from u PVC, smarts packs and plugs to car charging, window tinting on a sun facing rooms to cut down on air conditioning and a focus on proper insulation, he says.But solar is important and Steve believes the technology is available right now to capture and, crucially, store enough for it to be entirely viable.While it may not be suitable for all builds, specically apartments, it will be an important part of, for example, social housing.The organisation already operates in the social housing sector here, which is taking the lead on introducing a renewable energy element to new builds and modications.But this side of the border is behind efforts in the Republic of Ireland, where all new social housing building must have a renewable element, and there are grants available for that purpose from the government.“We do not have that here, Steve says.Parr#s decision to set up the new arm is part of the overall drive for much more energy efficiency along with switching from fossil fuels to renewables.But it is likely to be a dficult road, particularly when it comes to  electric vehicles, as there is not the infrastructure available to match demand.There is simply not the capacity to accommodate a wholesale switch.Steve cites the example of a major distribution centre where his company installed  EV chargers but all are not in use right now due to the lack of capacity.“The launch of Parr Renewables comes at a time when an increased uptake in renewable energy has never been more vital,” adds  Richard.With the recent surge in fossil fuel prices alongside the targets set for reducing carbon emissions, businesses are facing incredibly challenging times.“We’d already experienced a signicant increase in enquiries from existing customers on what measures they could take to improve their energy efficiency. His team has been working what the company describes as a wide iety of clients, all now engaged in the procurement process and reviewing proposals for renewable installations within their businesses.Most ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two years‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant PlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksLatest Environment‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentMalachi O#DohertyOpinionA world in which bicycles are king is safer and healthierKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemSerial entrepreneur Mark Dowds: ‘I took lessons from my dad and applied them in a dferent era’LatestIncrease in borrowers remortgaging homes at end of Commissioner tells conference he wants to see more women join policeFormer Commons leader calls for Bercow to be expelled from Labour PartyMen must sing from ‘same hymn sheet’ as women, Rochelle Humes saysQueen holds virtual audiences at Windsor,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Finucane, the widow of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane Alan ErwinMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailLong-delayed legal action against the UK Government for not holding a public inquiry into the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane is set to go ahead in June, a judge announced today.The challenge mounted by the murdered lawyer#s widow has been provisionally listed for a three-day hearing at the High Court in Belfast.Mr Finucane was shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries at his home in the north of the city in February .His family have campaigned ever since for a public inquiry to establish the full scale of security force collusion in the murder.In February  the Supreme Court held that previous probes into the killing failed to meet Article  human rights standards.The solicitor#s widow, Geraldine Finucane, initially issued proceedings in a bid to force the Government to act on the finding that no proper investigation had been carried out.Although Secretary of State Brandon Lewis subsequently apologised for the delay in making a decision, he announced in November  there would be no public inquiry at this stage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He said that other police review processes needed to run their course.An order was then made for the Secretary of State to pay £, damages to Mrs Finucane for the excessive delay in reaching his position.Since then, she has been seeking a judicial review of the position adopted by Mr Lewis.The current challenge centres on the legality of his decision to await the outcome of reviews by the PSNI#s Legacy Investigations Branch and the Police Ombudsman.Mrs Finucane and her legal representatives allege that it breaches her Article  rights, and that the Secretary of State is bound by the violation identied by the Supreme Court.The case has been repeatedly put back amid efforts to recover and analyse all relevant archived documents from police facilities at Seapark in Co Antrim.Lawyers for the government sought more time to carry out security assessments and get ready for the challenge.The High Court was previously told the process to prepare evidence involves going through , pages of documents.Counsel for Mrs Finucane has repeatedly expressed scepticism about the Secretary of State#s motives.It was claimed that he has been involved in an outrageous attempt to undermine the Supreme Court findings by trying to run down the clock in the challenge.Following a series of adjournments, Mr Justice Scoffield today provisionally listed the case for a full hearing, beginning on June .He scheduled a further review at the end of the month to confirm the new date.Most ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two years‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Restoration of St Patrickrsquos Cross and the interpretation  were financially supported.Exhibitions have benefited from the Friendsrsquo support in recent years with a major contribution to the extension at the back of the site was signicant. This included paintings for the new Tea Room.Talks and lecture series have been organised both in in the museum and at other venues with all profits given to the Friends.And dozens more: from the purchase of trees and shrubs for the garden at the back of the site to the purchase of a Papal bull..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Aontú selects human rights activist to run in Assembly election  ","story":"AONTUacute is fielding a candidate in South Down in the May Assembly election.The party has confirmed that Rosemary McGlone will be its standard bearer when voters go to the polls in  weeksrsquo time to elect five MLAs to represent the constituency.Aontuacute says it views South Down as a key constituency and aims to challenge the Stormont ldquoestablishment parties and provide genuine opposition to the to the broken Stormont system.A nationalist and human rights activist, Ms McGlone is a secondary school teacher in Belfast and a mother of four young children.Her party says that like many nationalists, she felt no longer represented by Sinn Fein or the SDLP and that rather than let herself be disenfranchised with no one to vote for, she has taken a step forward so that people like her might have a voice in Stormont.Aontuacute says that like so many, Rosemary has been ldquofrustrated by Nationalist parties who have abandoned their communities and supported discriminatory policies.It says the final straw for the South Down candidate came when Sinn Feacutein and SDLP MLAs voted for abortion up until birth for children with disabilities. Aontuacute says Rosemary also opposes the de-prioritisation funding of hundreds of local schools that is contained in the Integrated Education Bill.Her party leader, Peader Toacuteibiacuten, said , people are on housing waiting lists, , on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year, a quarter of a million people are in poverty and Sinn Fein and SDLP MLAs have voted for abortion right up until the birth of the child.He declared: ldquoThat the DUP has torn down Stormont in the middle of these very real human crisis is wrong and it must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoAontuacute is the only political party calling for the reform of the democratic institutions to prevent any one party tearing them down again or any one party preventing an Executive being formed in the future.ldquoThese le and death issues are too important for Stormont to be crashed over and over again. We are also calling for the suspension of MLA salaries for the political parties who crash the democratic institutions or prevent Executives being formed.Mr Aontuacute described Ms McGlone as a le-long human rights activist and nationalist who stopped voting for the SDLP because ldquoit abandoned her and so many communities to pursue identity politics.He continued: ldquoRosemary will lead the fight to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who currently have no representation in Co Down. Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill. All students mdash Catholic, Protestant and Integrated mdash should be treated equally. A vote for Rosemary is a vote for compassion and a vote to fix the broken system..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch lose out to UCD side  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH blew their chance to draw UCD into the relegation dogfight with a poor first half display into the wind on Saturday.There had been high hopes of a victory with a sizeable UCD contingent involved in the Ireland U- squad and the release of Ulsterrsquos Tom Stewart and Comac Izuchukwu to bolster the pack.However, the late withdrawal of the vastly experienced John Donnan meant a reshuffle with Tom Martin stepping in at lock and debutant Kyle Gill up to the bench.Playing into a gale in the first half, Ballynahinch failed to keep possession of the ball for long enough to exert any control on proceedings and were soon behind to a couple of excellently struck Chris Cosgrave penalties.The home side were denied a certain try when Stewart broke up the blindside and offloaded to a flying Conor McAuley but his foot was judged to be in touch.This proved to be signicant moment in the match as UCD scored a close range try from centre Dave Ryan soon afterwards to lead by  points with half an hour gone.Disaster was to strike for the home side on the stroke of half time when Ballynahinch found themselves pinned back from what should have been a comfortable position in the UCD half.They gave away a scrum penalty to concede territory but excellent defence forced a UCD knock-on and regained possession.Instead of playing narrow channels and reaching half-time no further in arrears, they were turned over in the middle of the field, allowing UCD to play an excellent kick behind a scrambling defence which then had to concede a goal lineout into a mph wind.The kick went straight out, handing the students a five-metre attacking scrum, and several phases later winger Ross Deegan scored. The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy.

The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

Their production is an echo of the old industrial output of businesses such as Harland and Wolff, which constructed some of the finest ships that ever set sail.It is encouraging to hear Mr Khan, like Mr Johnson and other visitors to Wrightbus such as the former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, talk of the bus orders in terms of a UK perspective, in which the regions and their connection to Britain’s biggest city are celebrated.It is a pity though that the shipping or automotive industries in the UK are not what they might be, given the way that more amorphous sectors such as services have become so dominant to the overall economy.It is even more of a pity that UK manufacturing of objects for use in a city where in the UK now has to navigate an obstacle to movement of goods and parts within the nation.Removing that barrier, the Northern Ireland Protocol, is essential.

The chanting of hate-filled pro-IRA propaganda by GAA supporters routinely surfaces on social media. If, as Ruth Dudley Edwards suggests, the GAA feels embarrassed by having Sinn Fein unveil a monument to IRA terrorists at one of their clubs, they keep it well hidden. Their statement that they “...will work on issuing guidance to clubs and counties on such events in the future” downplays the offence that such “events” engender within all right-minded people. However, until the GAA complete their “work” they should issue a clear unequivocal statement that anyone who supports, justies or celebrates violence inflicted in furtherance of political objectives — past, present or future — is unwelcome within the GAA. Until such a statement is made no further tax-payers money should be given to the GAA.Thomas Smyth, Belfast BTRuth Dudley Edwards: Little chance for power sharing when Sinn Fein laud IRA"},{"url":null,"title":"wearing masks in school is of no benefit to children but rather causes harm ","story":"Where to drop off items in Northern Ireland to help refugees who are fleeing Ukraine   ‘Major rally’ details announced as unionists voice regret at Sinn Fein anonymity rulingNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionWearing masks in school is of no benefit to children but rather causes harmA letter from Hugh McCarthy:By LettersThursday, rd March , : amUpdated Thursday, rd March , : am  \"       \"  A school pupil’s capacity to express feelings is affected by being masked.

It was carried out by Uswitch and can be viewed here: https:www.uswitch car-insurance guides uk-dog-friendly-beaches-mapped In their list of  beaches from across the UK, Ogmore Beach comes in third place behind Cayton Bay in North Yorkshire and Oxwich Beach near Swansea.MORE NEWS:Coronavirus: One in three adults in Wales now fully vaccinatedDream seaside home has seven bedrooms and an amazing al-fresco entertaining areaLaurence Llewellyn-Bowen joins campaign to transform oldest Vale homeThe Uswitch guide says that Ogmore Beach is best for fishing, walking and dog-friendly pubs and the car park costs £ a day, with dogs allowed on the beach all-year round and there are no restrictions. They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This will include a regular annual vacination programme, the Welsh Government has said.: Three Covid deaths reported in Wales - more than  new cases in Gwent.It comes as Mr Drakeford has said that Wales will remain at alert level zero for the next three weeks, with no further changes to Covid regulations planned before March .Then, all legal measures could be removed, should the public health situation remain stable, the first minister said.“We’ve been living in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic for two long years,” he said. “It has touched all our lives – across Wales, families and communities have made many sacrices to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. People in Wales have followed the rules.“But sadly, too many families have experienced the pain of losing a loved one or a close friend. My thoughts are with them all.“As we publish this longer-term plan, there is no doubt we have reached a signicant moment in this pandemic and we can look to the future with growing confidence that the next year will be one in which we have a dferent relationship with the virus.“This has been made possible by the hard work of everyone and by the efforts of all the health and care staff, public sector workers and volunteers who have done so much over the last two years..remove“But the pandemic isn’t over – this virus is full of nasty surprises and we are likely to see fluctuations in global patterns of infection for several years.“We need to be ready to respond quickly to any future outbreaks or new iants as we learn to live safely alongside coronavirus in the long-term.“We have learned so much over the last two years and we need to harness this as we look forward to a safer and brighter future together.”Together for a Safer Future: Wales’ Long-term Covid- Transition from Pandemic to Endemic will set out a gradual transition away from emergency measures using two core scenarios – Covid Stable and Covid Urgent.Covid Stable – the most likely scenario – is where Wales may encounter new waves of infection, but they are not expected to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS, due to the effectiveness of vaccines and other treatments, such as new Covid- antivirals.The Welsh Government has said this will include vaccination boosters in the spring for  the elderly and most vulnerable adults, and a regular autumn vaccination programme. The Test, Trace, Protect proramme will also move to a more targeted approach aimed at vulnerable people.Planning is also under way for a Covid-Urgent scenario, to allow for the Welsh Government and other public services to quickly respond to situations such as a new iant which evades the vaccine.The next review of restrictions will be carried out by March . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Standards we know we’re capable of reaching. Gotta go on a run now. 💪 pic EMOmEZ— Harry KaneMarch , Kane, who scored twice in the Everton defeat, has spoken atabout how much he is enjoying working under Conte and has called on his side to “take responsibility” and get back to “where we think the club should be”.He said: “The manager is a fantastic coach, I’ve said that now on many occasions.“I really enjoy working with him, so it’s down to us players to take that responsibility. A lot of us want to be playing in the Champions League.“We haven’t played in it now for a couple of years but it’s where we think the club should be.“So there’s a lot of hard work to go. It’s not just about one result because we’ve had good results like this, this season already.“It’s about putting together a run of four, five results in a row. Obviously we’ve got another tough game on Saturday .“If we want to move forward as a team, it’s about taking responsibility and we can’t hide away from it.“Obviously there’s  games left now so there’s still a lot of opportunity to pick up points and it’s just down to being more consistent.

I’m  now, I feel like physically I’m in a really good place,” he said.“I feel mentally, my game understanding and my awareness on the pitch is at a really high level from just gaining experience over the years.“Antonio has definitely given me more strings to my bow. I’m always someone who tries to improve. When I’m ,  I’ll still be trying to improve.“That’s just my mindset. But for sure, I’m in a good place. It’s nice to be scoring goals, winning games, helping the team.“Overall, it’s about working hard, keeping my head down.“There’s always stuff I can improve on, whether it’s finishing, hold up play, passing – and that’s what I’ll continue to do.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityState television said the launch took place in the north-eastern Shahroud Desert, without specying when.It came as Iran’s top diplomat at the months-long talks suddenly flew home late on Monday for consultations, a sign of the growing pressure on Tehran as the negotiations appear to be nearing their end.The Guard said the Noor- satellite reached a low orbit of  kilometresabove the Earth’s surface on the Qased satellite carrier, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. vw,vw,px, px\"The launch reportedly took place in the Shahroud Desert It described the Qased, or “Messenger” in Farsi, as a three-phase, mixed-fuel satellite carrier.“It is a great achievement that we can put our eyes in the sky again and look at the Earth from space,” said Guard General Hossein Salami, according to IRNA.The Guard did not immediately release photos or video of the launch, but authorities have already begun receiving signals from the satellite as it circles the Earth every  minutes, IRNA quoted information and communications technology minister Isa Zarepour as saying.The launch came days after satellite pictures suggested Iran’s civilian programme had suffered another failed launch.Noor means “light” in Farsi. The Guard launched its first Noor satellite in , revealing to the world it ran its own space programme.The head of the US Space Command later dismissed that satellite as “a tumbling webcam in space” that would not provide Iran vital intelligence — though it showed Tehran’s ability to get into orbit after a series of setbacks.The US has alleged Iran’s satellite launches defy a UN Security Council resolution and has called on Tehran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani The US intelligence community’s  threat assessment, published on Tuesday, claimed such a satellite launch vehicle “shortens the timeline” to an intercontinental ballistic missile for Iran as it uses “similar technologies”.Iran, which has long said it does not seek nuclear weapons, previously maintained that its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. US intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency sat Tehran abandoned an organised military nuclear programme in .“We continue to assess that Iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that we judge would be necessary to produce a nuclear device,” the  US intelligence threat assessment said.IRNA described negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani’s trip home as being “within the framework of the usual consultations during the talks”, but the top negotiator for the European Union seemed to suggest whether the talks succeeded or failed now rested with the Islamic Republic.“There are no longer ‘expert level talks’. Nor ‘formal meetings’,” Enrique Mora wrote on Twitter, responding to comments by an Iranian analyst.“It is time, in the next few days, for political decisions to end the #ViennaTalks. The rest is noise.”His comments mirror those of British and French negotiators at the Vienna talks, which have been working to find a way to get America back into the accord it unilaterally abandoned in  under then-president Donald Trump.They also hope to get Iran to again agree to measures that drastically scaled back its nuclear programme in exchange for the lting of economic sanctions.The comments also appear to push back against a constant Iranian refrain in the last weeks of talks that tried to blame any delay on America, which has not been in the room for talks since Mr Trump’s withdrawal.US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Sunday said he believed “we’re close” to a deal, though there were “a couple of very challenging remaining issues”..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Iran us Revolutionary Guard launches second satellite  u report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The earthworks, drainage and all  structures along the scheme are now substantially complete, and more than % of the new surface course has already laid along the main carriageway.The Tirbracken Road, now boasts new roundabout“Other works still required to complete the scheme include the provision of safety barrier, road marking, signage, street lighting at junctions, landscaping and accommodation works. It is expected that this dualling scheme will be complete this year, largely as planned.“When both schemes are complete, approximately three quarters of the Belfast to Derry route will be dual carriageway standard or better. As well as improving the standard of carriageway along the A, both schemes provide enhanced provision for public transport, pedestrians and cyclists. New park and rides sites are now also operational at Drumdergand Drumahoe, with a further park and ride site currently under construction at Claudy.“These flagship schemes represent an investment of over £m and will signicantly enhance the connectivity of the North West, improve journey time reliability, reduce journey times and improve road safety.”The scheme will provide . kilometres of high standard dual carriageway between Drumahoe and Dungiven, including a bypass of Dungiven with new roundabouts connecting the scheme to the existing road network at either end.Nichola MallonDerry  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularMan stole £, worth of alcohol including champagne...NewsBikes worth more than £, stolen in Moneymore burglary...NewsMissing Greenisland man found...NewsEntrepreneurial sisters launch female mentorship programme i...NewsWitness appeal after car damaged near doctor’s surgery in Lu...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statementcanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
