He said: \u0027She was amazing, very satisfying. In the islands we don\u0027t kiss and tell, but there were no complaints in that department\u0027          Misick says their relationship fizzled out because of the long distance and he began dating the actress and model LisaRaye McCoy (pictured together in 2006), whom he married the next year. He says they broke off ties for good after McCoy spotted him chatting to Omarosa at an NAACP event and angrily demanded they end their friendship\u0027She would always give me sound advice. In fact I wish I had taken more of her advice - some things would have been different.\u0027 Omarosa has never publicly disclosed the fling with Misick, which he says took place in 2005 after she orced her first husband, Aaron Stallworth. She was a rising reality TV star at the time, having achieved infamy one year earlier as the villain of the first Season of The Apprentice. The well-connected pair first crossed paths at a charity function in New York when they were introduced by a mutual friend.\u0027Clearly there was chemistry. We chatted for a very, very longtime. She\u0027s a beautiful and amazing woman. I was attracted to her,\u0027 the ex-Premier recalled. Misick was in the US to court celebrities and well-heeled tourists in a bid to bring wealth and glamour to his sun-drenched archipelago, southeast of the Bahamas. But the smooth-talking statesman said he would end up spending the entire weekend with Omarosa, touring Manhattan and enjoying intimate nights at his suite at the plush Four Seasons Hotel. \u0027I knew who she was and she knew who I was. What struck me about her was her intellect. She was highly intelligent which is not the first thing that comes to mind with a reality star,\u0027 Misick said. \u0027She was highly knowledgeable about politics and world affairs. We had a very interesting, stimulating conversation. \u0027We were obviously mature, consenting adults who were both single at the time and we were smitten with each another. So, yes, we did spend an amazing time together.\u0027 Misick would fly back to New York just a week later with the fledgling couple enjoying a romantic dinner date at Sylvia\u0027s Harlem restaurant, famed for its soul food and celebrity clientele.             The two began their romps in 2005, meeting at a charity function in New York after the Apprentice villain orced her first husband, Aaron Stallworth (pictured together in 2004)          Misick\u0027s tenure in the Turks and Caicos ended in notoriety when he was accused of corruption by the British government who forced him to stand down in 2009 and imposed direct rule          Omarosa\u0027s first \u0027White House\u0027: Misick said Omarosa was a regular visitor to the Turks and Caicos during their six month tryst. Pictured: Misick\u0027s former $8 million mansion, nicknamed the \u0027White House\u0027Weeks later she would accompany him to Dubai, where he slipped away from official functions to entertain her at the One and Only Royal Mirage Hotel, where suites cost $6,000 a night. \u0027We were dating, to use the American term,\u0027 said Misick, who has been married three times and has six children by five different women. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say that we were monogamous - that question never came up. We were dating, we were getting to know each other and having fun. \u0027She was amazing, very satisfying. In the islands we don\u0027t kiss and tell, but without kissing and telling, there were no complaints in that department.\u0027 Omarosa was a regular visitor to the Turks and Caicos during the six month tryst, sometimes taking along her mom Theresa - who calls herself Momarosa - to enjoy the swank resorts and restaurants laid on by Misick. \u0027Her and her mother have a special relationship and they were really nice people,\u0027 he said, sitting down with DailyMailTV on the island of Providenciales, the archipelago\u0027s principle tourism hub.           \u0027She was highly intelligent which is not the first thing that comes to mind with a reality star,\u0027 Misick said. Pictured: Omarosa around the time of their tryst in 2005The lovebirds were seen together at official functions and attended the South Caicos Regatta, where Misick recalls they were caught out by the tides and got stuck on a sandbar for hours. \u0027We just chilled and enjoyed the moment,\u0027 he said with a smile. \u0027We would have had catering on the boat, strawberries, grapes, fruits, champagne, beer, whiskey. And seafood - fish, conch, lobster.\u0027 He added of their time together: \u0027Most of the time it would be three or four days or a long weekend. We would either stay at a resort or my residence.\u0027Omarosa enjoyed the water. She loved the beach, she loved to swim, she loved boating. \u0027She was not a big drinker but of course everyone loves champagne. She respected the office that I had so she never did anything improper while she was with me. \u0027She was a fun person but she wasn\u0027t a wild, party crazy type of woman. I\u0027ve clearly dated those types as well, but she was not one of those. \u0027I never saw her indulge in over-drinking or drugs or anything like that. I think she could have made a good First Lady.\u0027 Misick, who married this year for the third time, says he was impressed by Omarosa\u0027s networking skills and contacts in the world of celebrity and politics. The Howard University alumnus had previously worked in the office of Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton administration, though she was later panned by her former administrator as the \u0027worst hire we ever made\u0027. Determined to transform the Turks and Caicos into the \u0027Monte Carlo of the Caribbean\u0027, Misick asked Omarosa to help raise his profile in the US, particularly among his key tourism demographic of wealthy African Americans.\u0027I would ask her the best way to market our destination,\u0027 he said. \u0027She\u0027s a very strong, powerful and opinionated woman. I\u0027m not intimidated by a strong women, I embrace strong women. \u0027She would give her advice and sometimes it was strong but ultimately as the person who was the leader of the country, it was my decision to make.\u0027           Trump and Omarosa have fallen out bitterly since her abrupt departure from the White House, with Omarosa aiming a series of barbs at her former boss in her best-selling memoir, Unhinged          Misick said he believed Omarosa and Trump were \u0027friends\u0027 with a \u0027love hate relationship\u0027. He added: \u0027Clearly something happened and he wanted her out of the White House so maybe the circumstances made her change her loyalty\u0027 Misick told DailyMailTV he also discussed Omarosa\u0027s time on The Apprentice with her - and her relationship with Donald Trump, who would later appoint her director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison. The pair have fallen out bitterly since her abrupt departure from the White House, with Omarosa aiming a series of barbs at her former boss in her best-selling memoir, Unhinged. She also alleges that tapes exist dating back to their time together filming The Apprentice in which the President is caught on mic using the N-word.\u0027They were friends. They seemed to have a love hate relationship. She was a Democrat at that time and maybe he was at the time as well, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 recalled Misick. \u0027I was not surprised he chose her to be part of his government. She clearly is controversial and there seems to have been mixed feelings even amongst the African American community, but she\u0027s very competent from my standpoint. Full Disclosure: Most shocking things about Donald Trump in...Share this article\u0027I know her to be a loyal person but even loyalty sometimes changes. Clearly something happened and he wanted her out of the White House so maybe the circumstances made her change her loyalty. He added: \u0027I can\u0027t recall whether she ever told me that Mr Trump used the n-word. I know Mr Trump as well, I\u0027ve gone to events at his estate, Mar-a-Lago. \u0027At one stage we were talking to them about hosting the Miss Universe pageant. In all my interactions with him he\u0027s been very respectful and I\u0027ve certainly not heard him use the N-word.\u0027 Misick says his relationship with Omarosa fizzled because of the long distance between them and he began dating the actress and model LisaRaye McCoy, whom he later married in 2006 but orced two years later. He says they broke off ties for good after McCoy spotted him chatting to Omarosa at an NAACP event and angrily demanded they end their friendship.           \u0027We were dating, to use the American term,\u0027 said Misick, who has been married three times and has six children by five women. The lovebirds were seen together at official functions and attended the South Caicos Regatta, where Misick recalls they were caught out by the tides and got stuck on a sandbar for hours          Last year Omarosa married Florida-based pastor John Allen Newman (pictured together in 2016) and became First Lady of his downtown Jacksonville churchOmarosa subsequently began dating Green Mile actor Michael Clarke Duncan who died of a heart attack in 2012. Last year she married Florida-based pastor John Allen Newman and became First Lady of his downtown Jacksonville church.Misick, meanwhile, was linked to a string of high-profile US actresses and celebs including Rocsi Diaz, best known as the co-host on the BET show 106 \u0026amp Park, and Nicole Murphy, ex-wife of comedian Eddie Murphy. He also built himself a sprawling $8 million mansion, nicknamed the \u0027White House,\u0027 which the British government now accuses him of funding through graft. Misick was appointed Premier of the Turks and Caicos in 2003, taking charge of a country with limited infrastructure and few modern amenities.His supporters say he oversaw a period of massive growth, developing hotels, resorts and establishing it as an A-list vacation spot. But after a landslide second election win in 2007 he demanded the island\u0027s British-appointed Governor begin the process towards a referendum on independence from the UK. British officials responded by launching an investigation into Misick that accused him of ushering in massive corruption and \u0027a palpable climate of fear\u0027. They also questioned how someone with declared assets of $50,000 when he came into power could be living a playboy lifestyle complete with Presidential-style mansion and leased private jet.           Misick was put on trial in December 2015 for fraud, bribery and money laundering in a case that has been dragging on ever since, costing its citizens an estimated $1 million every month          In 2009 the UK declared a national emergency, suspending the constitution and taking back control of the island. Misick and other ministers were accused of financing lavish lifestyles by acquiring publicly-owned land and selling it to developers. Before charges were brought, Misick moved to Brazil where his claim for asylum was rejected and he was handed over to Interpol to be returned to the Turks and Caicos. He has spent the last three years on trial in a court case which is estimated to be costing the country of just 31,000 inhabitants around $1 million a month. \u0027I just couldn\u0027t accept that you can get elected and then you have some civil servant from England come and dictate to you how you should run your country,\u0027 he told DailyMailTV.\u0027I found that offensive then and I still find that offensive. We know what\u0027s best for our country - we want to be free.\u0027Misick has described his nation\u0027s official status as a British Overseas Territory as a \u0027relic\u0027 of colonialism and alleges his prosecution is a racially-driven political witch-hunt.\u0027As a matter of fact, the then-governor in a cable to London said, \u0027we have to stop Misick now because he\u0027s popular and he wants independence. And unless we stop him now, nothing will stop him.\u0027          Misick also hopes to add Omarosa\u0027s Unhinged to his reading list in the coming weeks. \u0027I haven\u0027t read her book as yet. I\u0027m waiting for an autographed copy,\u0027 he joked\u0027So they used that as an opportunity to make these allegations of corruption. I resigned from office in 2009 and I\u0027ve had the last, almost ten years fighting these alleged charges,\u0027 he said. The prosecution is Misick\u0027s trial is due to rest its case in the next few weeks when his legal team will argue there is no case to answer.He has sold the White House and remains on bail. The globe-trotting former politician is not allowed to leave the Turks and Caicos without the permission of the courts. A short-lived attempt at a political comeback ended in failure in December 2016 when Misick stood as an independent candidate in the general election but received less than 6 percent of the vote.He plans to have another go \u0027when, and not if\u0027 he is cleared. \u0027I have never solicited or accepted a bribe from anyone. And I intend to do whatever it takes to clear my name and defend myself until the last breath is in my body,\u0027 he vowed.Misick also hopes to add Omarosa\u0027s Unhinged to his reading list in the coming weeks.\u0027I haven\u0027t read her book as yet.

Everything from cash machines to home heating systems, from electricity generators to mobile phones and the health service relies on cyber technology. We have seen many times in recent years the enormous disruption caused by a temporary breakdown in service, as happened during the botched IT upgrade at the TSB bank.Similarly, 18 months ago the NHS was hit by a major cyber problem, prompting the mass cancellation of operations. Then the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un was cynical enough to take the blame and the fear inspired by that. But it is clear, from the wealth of mounting evidence, that the Russians certainly have the capability and determination to launch similar attacks.If patients’ lives were put at risk by such a cyber attack, it would create a real global panic – the cyber-equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis.That is why we should be worried. What is happening now in cyberspace is even more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable than the darkest days of the Cold War.For all the anxieties back then about a nuclear stand-off, at least the hostility between the West and the Soviet Bloc was governed by respected boundaries. The rules – such as a prohibition on assassinations – were generally upheld. Both sides communicated with each other, partly from the need to avoid a nuclear apocalypse through a catastrophic misunderstanding.That culture has disappeared. We live in a much more fluid world where restrictions on movement – especially in Europe – hardly exist at all. At any given moment there are probably more than 100,000 Russians in Britain, most of them wholly innocent and here to work, study or enjoy a break. Yet that transient mass also provides cover for hostile intelligence agents.Moreover, technology makes it much easier for someone to cause mayhem. During the Cold War, if the Soviets wanted to hit a water pumping station or sabotage an aircraft, they had to send in armed agents. Today, that could be accomplished from an office in Moscow or Kiev – just as computer programs can churn out millions of emails to damage businesses, influence elections and propagate fake news.          Grainy surveillance footage shows the moment Dutch intelligence officers descended on the scene and caught the four men outside the chemical weapons agency          Pictures released at the briefing show the cache of equipment seized from the menThen there are the armies of hackers in ‘troll’ factories who spread destabilising information, such as Hillary Clinton’s emails or the details of Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins’ asthma prescriptions. The aim is to undermine public respect for Western politicians and heroes alike.The fall of the Berlin Wall almost three decades ago was a remarkable triumph for freedom and capitalism over totalitarianism. But that ascendancy lulled Western politicians into a false sense of security.Russia, which has an economy no bigger than that of Britain or France, is showing daily that if resources are focused on a certain area – in this case cyber warfare – then a nation can still have lethal power.And we are only just coming to terms with it. Yesterday Lord Ricketts, who served as Britain’s National Security Adviser until 2012, warned that the recent plots are just the start, ‘pilot projects’ to test defences in advance of a full-blooded cyber assault to bring anarchy to the West.          Russian president Vladimir Putin waves to spectators prior to boarding a car after his arrival in New Delhi as the GRU\u0027s campaign of cyber warfare against the west was today exposedAs president Putin’s invasion of Crimea and his support for the Assad regime in Syria has shown, he is not a man constrained by normal democratic values. Throughout his presidency he has been pushing at boundaries, seeing what he can get away with, what will provoke the West to act.Now his dwindling popularity at home over his domestic agenda – particularly his attempt to raise the retirement age – makes it all the more imperative for him to wrap himself in the nationalist flag with high-profile attacks on the West.At least the complacency in Europe and America is beginning to lift and we are starting to fight back – as highlighted by the unprecedented news conference yesterday in which the Dutch defence minister, Ank Bijleveld, and Peter Wilson, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, explained how the OPCW conspiracy was foiled.In the context of cyber warfare, the West has unparalleled expertise. The staff of both the US National Security Agency and our own formidable base at GCHQ in Cheltenham have world-beating abilities in hacking computers and other electronic devices.So far the West has proved far more restrained than Russia in deploying that expertise. There is only one documented case of Western agents using a computer against an enemy state’s infrastructure. That occurred when the Israelis and the Americans worked together to release the Stuxnet virus into the computers that operated Iran’s nuclear programme. It proved what the West can do if necessary.But any escalation in cyber warfare is fraught with risk. A miscalculation by any rogue agents, anxious to ingratiate themselves with the Kremlin, could have disastrous consequences.We do well to remember that the new world disorder, which Putin promotes as well as relishes, is our new reality. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/05/05/5103572F00000578-0-image-m-27_1538712798023.jpg","title":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reviews Placebo Experiment","story":"    Dr Michael Mosley attempts to train his own body to respond to a vile tasting green drink Dr Michael washed down two high-strength caffeine pills with the gloop.

The group are accused of a range of attacks on institutions and iniduals around the world. The attacks are linked to Russian attempts to spy on investigations into doping in sport, politics in the Ukraine and the US, and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the UK  After the Dutch named four men it caught hacking The Hague, US authorities released images of Artem Malyshev, 30, Ivan Yermakov, 32, and Dmitriy Badin, 27 (pictured, left to right), who it named as GRU hackers  CCTV images show Alexey Minin (left), while Oleg Sotnikov (right) is pictured on a photo recovered from a phone.

They attempted to smash up some of the phones (inset) when they realised authorities were on to them  These images, made available by the Dutch Ministry of Defence today, are said to show the hacking equipment that four Russian intelligence officers used for a cyber attack on the OPCW        Loverboy Lexa, footballer \u0027Zhenya\u0027 and a baby-faced kingpin who used the alias \u0027Karen Millen\u0027: Putin\u0027s \u0027dumb Bonds\u0027 hacking squad unmaskedThey were supposed to be top spies, hidden from the world and operating behind a veil of secrecy.But after Dutch, British and US authorities blew the lid off Putin\u0027s ham-fisted hacking squad yesterday, the identities of the GRU\u0027s \u0027Unit 26165\u0027 can now be revealed.The gang include computer geeks - who advertised themselves on Moscow dating websites and played in the city\u0027s amateur football leagues .They served alongside more hardened members of the Kremlin\u0027s security apparatus, who organised and oversaw the group\u0027s many trips abroad and acted as the hackers\u0027 minders.              Alexei Morenets, 41, is an officer in Russia\u0027s GRU and believed to be one of its top hackers - but also responsible for most extraordinary blunder of The Hague mission.It appears that Morenets inadvertently outed more than 300 other agents working for the GRU in Moscow.Investigators have found he travelled on a diplomatic passport using his  real names and date of birth.News agency Bellingcat, who revealed the true identities of the Salisbury assassins, say he is registered as living at the GRU\u0027s Military Academy in Moscow.Morenets\u0027 Lada is also registered at GRU’s cyber warfare department down the road - and investigators say by searching other vehicles registered to the same address they have identified 305 other members of the 26165 unit accused of hacking targets all over world.To add to Mr Putin’s embarrassment the leaked list includes his spies\u0027 names, dates of birth and mobile phone numbers - unmasking and effectively dismantling his most elite cyber attack unit.The online expert also uses the online nicknames Lexa and Alexey, according to the FBI, and even  uploaded a picture of his face to the website mylove.ru using a photograph taken in the Russian capital.When he wasn\u0027t targeting anti- doping agencies and helping spread fake news in a bid to level allegations of substance abuse at western athletes, the 41-year-old appeared to be seeking women aged 21 to 30 in Moscow.It was also possible to geolocate the profile to within 650 feet of the GRU headquarters. And the profile picture appears to have been taken close to the intelligence base. The famous Panasonic building is clearly in shot, indicating it was taken on Komsomolsky Prospekt.             Alexei Sergey Vich Morenets uploaded a picture of his face to the website mylove.ru using a photograph taken in the Russian capital               Evgenii Serebriakov, 37, also known as Zhenya, is believed to be hiding in Moscow.The cyber expert used an email with the name Casey Ryback, a character played by Steven Seagal in the film Under Siege, which tells the story of terrorists attacking an American ship.His laptop was packed with details about previous misisons and even contained selfies from the 2016 Olympics in Brazil where Russian athletes\u0027 doping samples were tampered with and US athletes\u0027 medical records leaked.His computer also had the Spiez laboratory in its search history and train tickets to Bern where a wanted to hack more chemical weapons inspectors. He was travelling under his real name and date of birth - and in another fatal error was registered as living at the GRU\u0027s Moscow headquarters.            Evgenii Serebriakov was among four Russians trying to hack chemical weapons inspectors and his laptop contained this selfie  at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil - revealing one of more than a dozen GRU missions across the globe              Artem Malyshev, 30, is described by the FBI as a \u0027senior lieutenant\u0027 in Unit 26165.Born in a small rural town near the picturesque Valdai National Park in the north west of Russia, he went on to become a member of the GRU\u0027s hacking unit.Documents released yesterday state he used the names \u0027djangomagicdev\u0027 and \u0027realblatr\u0027 online as part of the hacking conspiracy.The FBI want him over the hack on the 2016 US presidential election, with the indictment stating he stole and released documents \u0027to interfere with the election\u0027.He is also charged over a wider group of offences, related to hacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the US anti-doping agency.              Baby-faced Ivan Yermakov, 32, was born in the grim, industrial Chelyabinsk region of eastern Russia.US authorities say he was involved in one the first hacks attributed to Unit 26165, reconnaissance of Westinghouse Electric Company\u0027s (WEC) in Pennsylvania, a company involved in the supply of power to the Ukraine.FBI documents state he would often pose as women online.He used the names Kate S. Milton, James McMorgans and Karen W. Millen online.Yermakov was also involved in \u0027spearphishing\u0027 attacks on WADA in 2016, and activities at the Rio Olympics.              Dmitriy Badin, 27, is the youngest of the seven men named by the US yesterday as being part of the hacking group.He was previously named among 12 agents who allegingly hacked into American computers to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.He was born in  Kursk, close to Russia\u0027s border with Ukraine, a city which is forever associated with the Soviet Union\u0027s tank battle victory over the Nazis in the Second World War.He has previously been described as an \u0027Assistant Head of Department\u0027 in the GRU hacking squad.The latest FBI poster states he is wanted over \u0027computer intrusions of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other victim entities during the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics and afterward\u0027.              Hackers\u0027 minder and GRU spy  Alexey Minin, 46, appears to have been in The Hague to protect two hackers trying to break in the OPCW\u0027s WiFi.Bearded Minin is one of the oldest in the group and could be the man who stamped on his phone after being arrested in Holland in AprilThe FBI appear to know little about him including where he was born, his date of birth or if he has any aliases.But it is believed he is an intelligence officer who accompanies and protects GRU hackers on their worldwide trips.He is wanted for conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, the US State Department said yesterday.The FBI wanted poster also says he should be considered \u0027armed and dangerous\u0027 and he is believed to be in Russia.                Oleg Mikhailovich Sotnikov, 46, appears to be a Russian agent in Holland to protect the GRU\u0027s cyber experts.The FBI said he is wanted for money laundering offences in the US and may have been involved in criminal activities since 2014.Like his comrade Minin, little is known about him, including his real name because Sotnikov is believed to be his alias.He posed for a photograph found on  Serebriakov\u0027s laptop outside a Dutch station when they bought tickets for their next mission in Bern.But the team never made it to Switzerland after they were arrested in the Marriott in The Hague and deported from Holland.Sotnikov is considered armed and dangerous and believed to be in Russia.             The GRU - an acronym for Glavnoye razvedyvatel\u0027noye upravleniye or Main Intelligence Directorate - was founded in 1918 after Lenin\u0027s Bolshevik Revolution.Lenin insisted on its independence from other secret services and the GRU was seen as a rival by other Soviet secret services, such as the KGB.According to Yuri Shvets, a former KGB agent, GRU officers were referred to as \u0027boots\u0027 - tough but unsophisticated.\u0027The GRU took its officers from the trenches,\u0027 he said, whereas KGB picked its agents from the USSR\u0027s best universities.The GRU would train agents and then send them to represent the Soviet Union abroad as military attaches in foreign embassies, according to historian John Barron.But once a member of the GRU, it is believed to be exceptionally difficult to leave. And those who do so to joined foreign agencies were punished savagely.Viktor Suvorov, a GRU officer who defected to Britain in 1978, said new recruits were shown a video of a traitor from the agency being burned alive in a furnace as a warning.Unlike the KGB, the GRU was not split up when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.It has a special status and answers directly to the chief of the general staff, one of the three people who control Russia\u0027s portable nuclear control system.GRU chiefs are reportedly picked by Putin himself.The GRU is now considered Russia\u0027s largest foreign intelligence service, according to Reuters, dwarfing Moscow\u0027s better-known Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), which is the successor to the KGB\u0027s First Chief Directorate.Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in GRU , was considered by the Kremlin to be one of the most damaging spies of his generation.He was responsible for unmasking dozens of secret agents threatening Western interests by operating undercover in Europe.Col Skripal, 66, allegedly received £78,000 in exchange for taking huge risks to pass classified information to MI6.In 2006, he was sentenced to 13 years in a Russian labour camp after being convicted of passing invaluable Russian secrets to the UK.A senior source in Moscow said at the time: \u0027This man is a big hero for MI6.\u0027                                                       Unit 26165\u0027s trail of blunders: How Putin’s elite globe-trotting hacking squad left a trail of clues including a selfie at the Olympics, a pile of beer cans and a TAXI RECEIPT from their spy base to airportWestern intelligence yesterday revealed the trail of clues that bungling Russian spies known as Unit 26165 left in their wake as they waged a war of disinformation across the globe.Kremlin agents working for the GRU targeted FIFA, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Organisation for the Prevention of the use of Chemical Weapons as it investigated both the Salisbury novichok attack in the UK as well as the Douma chemical weapons attack in Syria, the international investigation of the downing of MH17 and a US company providing nuclear power to Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin\u0027s elite squad even created the fake \u0027hacktivist\u0027 group Fancy Bears to disseminate misleading statements designed to exonerate Russia of doping allegations and instead level them at the US.But it was yesterday revealed that the spies left a trail of clues including blunder after blunder during their international campaign.             The team of four GRU officers travelling on official Russian passports entered the Netherlands on April 10 – but it turned out that two of them were carrying documents with consecutive passport numbers      bellingcat - 305 Car Registrations May Point to Massive GRU Security Breach - bellingcat"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/05/07/5104578000000578-0-image-a-55_1538719954395.jpg","title":"First polar bear born UK disguises grizzly","story":"    Playful polar bear cub Hamish was the first to be born in Britain for 25 years.

Pictured: Matt Lauer and Megyn Kelly on the show on November 2Before adding of any negative comments about the segment, she said: \u0027All I\u0027m going to say is that I feel very strongly about the #MeToo coverage, the importance of doing it without fear or favor.\u0027I didn\u0027t let anyone stop me at Fox, and I\u0027m not going to let anyone stop me at NBC.\u0027But the 47-year-old doesn\u0027t believe that all men accused of harassment should have a blanket ban on returning to work.Kelly, who said she was harassed by former Fox boss Roger Ailes, explained: \u0027I feel it\u0027s a case-by-case basis.\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t think we need to see Harvey Weinstein in polite society ever again, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s true of everyone. I think, for some of these guys, there\u0027s a way forward. I happen to believe it starts with a full-throated apology, and not just this paper statement of, \u0027I did some things wrong and I\u0027m sorry.\u0027She said that women wanted to see, not just punishment, but that they had changed and grown. \u0027I think Americans are very forgiving, and I am very forgiving,\u0027 she said.\u0027I think these guys who want to completely skirt around it and just reappear and re-emerge in their old roles are kidding themselves,\u0027 she added. \u0027Women are feeling too empowered to allow that.           The former Fox anchor, pictured with Lauer in May last year, said she knew more than she could let on, telling US Weekly: \u0027I know too much that others don\u0027t know\u0027\u0027They don\u0027t want to just see punishment, they want to see that you get it. And the ones that we\u0027ve covered publicly had immense positions of power, so they absolutely should not be allowed to return to those until we understand there\u0027s been a sea change in their thinking and behavior.\u0027Meanwhile, Kelly has been focused on keeping her own job safe amid her show\u0027s tanking ratings, executives at NBC News tell DailyMailTV exclusively.The former Fox News host launched her much-hyped show Megyn Kelly Today last September after securing a three-year contract for a staggering $69 million.Despite NBC heavily promoting the 47-year-old\u0027s show, her ratings have been abysmal, with viewers changing the channel when the Today show ends over to rival ABC\u0027s Live with Kelly and Ryan.Megyn began extensively covering the #MeToo movement in a bid to carve out a place for her show, even covering her own colleagues at the network who had been accused or fired over allegations of sexual misconduct, most notably Matt Lauer and Tom Brokaw. Multiple top executives at NBC tell DailyMailTV they believe she has strategically positioned herself as a champion of #MeToo in case her show is cancelled, paving the way for a potential suit for being fired for speaking out against her employer.              Megyn began extensively covering the #MeToo movement in a bid to carve out a place for her show, NBC executives tell DailyMailTV, as a strategic plan in case her show is cancelled, paving the way for a potential suit for being fired for speaking out against her employerA high-ranking source at NBC told DailyMailTV: \u0027Everyone has had enough and they want Megyn out. \u0027It\u0027s like she\u0027s the Manchurian candidate of NBC News - someone put inside the network to take it down from within.\u0027Her strategy is the talk of 30 Rock. As soon as her show became a dumpster fire she actively positioned it as the only place on network television that it is \u0027\u0027MeToo\u0027\u0027 continually.\u0027By aggressively reporting on every male accused of sexual misconduct at the network, it would make her much harder to fire. \u0027If NBC did fire her, she\u0027ll argue she was terminated for speaking up, when in fact she is an opportunist who latched on to an important movement when nothing else was working for her.\u0027Let\u0027s be frank - a woman determined to support other women wouldn\u0027t have launched her show by asking Jane Fonda about her plastic surgery.\u0027  NBC president Andy Lack, who has been accused of turning a blind eye towards sexual misconduct claims at the network, is said to be \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Megyn\u0027s attempts to turn her show into a forum for the movement, including her coverage of claims against Brokaw and Lauer. An NBC News spokesperson responded in a statement: \u0027None of this is true. NBC News is thrilled that Megyn is on our team and extremely proud of her work including her coverage of the #MeToo movement since her earliest days at the network. \u0027We are also very pleased with her 9am show, which is substantive, empowering and engaging.\u0027        Megyn has positioned herself as a champion of #MeToo, even covering her own colleagues at the network who have faced sexual misconduct claims, such as Matt Lauer and Tom Brokaw               After Lauer was fired from the Today show in November 2017 following reports of sexual harassment, Megyn was the first to have a TV interview with Addie Collins Zinone (pictured), who had an affair with Matt LauerAfter Lauer was fired from the Today show in November 2017 following reports of sexual harassment, Megyn was the first to have a TV interview with Addie Collins Zinone. Zinone had a month-long affair with Lauer in 2000 when she was just a 24-year-old production assistant at Today.While Zinone said the relationship was consensual, she added that the power dynamics had made her later regret the relationship. Kelly\u0027s show hit its one year anniversary this month and she donned a little black dress and leopard heels, celebrating the milestone that many thought she wouldn\u0027t see, considering her disappointing ratings.ABC\u0027s rival show Live with Kelly and Ryan, starring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, has been trouncing Megyn\u0027s show, consistently beating her out in viewership. A top NBC brass added to DailyMailTV: \u0027The ratings show that when Megyn comes on, the audience leaves and switches over to Kelly and Ryan on ABC.\u0027Here is the highest paid on air personality actively tearing down the network at 9am every morning.  \u0027The anchors, producers and executives all share the same opinion - Megyn Kelly needs to leave NBC!\u0027 An NBC News spokesperson pointed to research that shows Megyn averaged 2.4 million viewers in September - the highest it has been since February.               Despite NBC backing Megyn\u0027s show, her ratings have been abysmal, with viewers quickly changing the channel when the Today show ends over to rival ABC\u0027s Live with Kelly and RyanFor Megyn\u0027s low ratings, her hefty salary of $23 million a year - $69 million over the course of three years - is seen as a \u0027mistake\u0027 by senior NBC executives. At the time of her deal, Lauer, who had been the network\u0027s shining star for more than a decade, was estimated to be earning $25 million a year - just $2 million more than Megyn, NBC\u0027s gamble on a newcomer.A network executive said to DailyMailTV: \u0027Her salary is also unfair - why should she be paid more than Savannah and Hoda combined. \u0027Two talented anchors who are loved by the audience and who viewers actively choose to watch. \u0027How is she worth more than Al Roker, Kathie Lee Gifford or Jimmy Fallon - all beloved household names that hold far greater star power at NBC and beyond.\u0027   Insiders say NBC has already mapped out a scenario for Kelly\u0027s exit where they could actually break even. By terminating her, NBC would be obligated to pay out the remainder of her contract. But they would be able to replace a very expensive hour of television with one that gets better ratings and is almost free to produce. NBC would immediately be able to replace Kelly in the 9am hour of Today by bringing back Al Roker to that hour, possibly combining him with Dylan Dreyer, a duo who executives expect will increase the 9am hour\u0027s ratings by 15-20 percent, thereby grow the hour\u0027s advertising revenue.More importantly, NBC would be able to bring the hour back to Studio 1A and drastically cut costs. Before Kelly arrived, NBC ran the 9am hour of Today at minimal expense, using the same studio and control room crew that produced Today\u0027s earlier hours and severely limiting costly taped pieces and food segments. Kelly\u0027s show, by contrast, is done in a separate studio and has a whole separate staff and spends lavishly on production. NBC could save even more money by terminating those staffers.And Megyn is dealing with chaos behind the scenes of her show, as earlier this year the morning program\u0027s head writer claimed it was a \u0027completely toxic\u0027 environment.        Megyn Kelly knows ‘too much that others don’t know’ about Matt Lauer - AOL Entertainment"},{"url":null,"title":"Waitrose delivery trial let drivers home out","story":"Waitrose is trialling a delivery service that gives drivers access to customers\u0027 homes to unpack groceries while they\u0027re out           The service called While You\u0027re Away allows a customer with a Yale smart lock to set a temporary access code which is then sent to Waitrose via a secure appThe supermarket believes it is the first in the UK to test demand for such a service – initially with 100 customers located near its fulfilment centre in Coulsdon, south London – after seeing it prove popular in the US and Scandinavia. There is a minimum order of £25 and, initially at least, a minimum of six deliveries, although Waitrose said it would review this after the trial.Waitrose said it anticipated being able to make the service available to more than 1,000 customers in spring next year depending on the success of the trial.Oops!

Everything from cash machines to home heating systems, from electricity generators to mobile phones and the health service relies on cyber technology. We have seen many times in recent years the enormous disruption caused by a temporary breakdown in service, as happened during the botched IT upgrade at the TSB bank.Similarly, 18 months ago the NHS was hit by a major cyber problem, prompting the mass cancellation of operations. Then the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un was cynical enough to take the blame and the fear inspired by that. But it is clear, from the wealth of mounting evidence, that the Russians certainly have the capability and determination to launch similar attacks.If patients’ lives were put at risk by such a cyber attack, it would create a real global panic – the cyber-equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis.That is why we should be worried. What is happening now in cyberspace is even more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable than the darkest days of the Cold War.For all the anxieties back then about a nuclear stand-off, at least the hostility between the West and the Soviet Bloc was governed by respected boundaries. The rules – such as a prohibition on assassinations – were generally upheld. Both sides communicated with each other, partly from the need to avoid a nuclear apocalypse through a catastrophic misunderstanding.That culture has disappeared. We live in a much more fluid world where restrictions on movement – especially in Europe – hardly exist at all. At any given moment there are probably more than 100,000 Russians in Britain, most of them wholly innocent and here to work, study or enjoy a break. Yet that transient mass also provides cover for hostile intelligence agents.Moreover, technology makes it much easier for someone to cause mayhem. During the Cold War, if the Soviets wanted to hit a water pumping station or sabotage an aircraft, they had to send in armed agents. Today, that could be accomplished from an office in Moscow or Kiev – just as computer programs can churn out millions of emails to damage businesses, influence elections and propagate fake news.          Grainy surveillance footage shows the moment Dutch intelligence officers descended on the scene and caught the four men outside the chemical weapons agency          Pictures released at the briefing show the cache of equipment seized from the menThen there are the armies of hackers in ‘troll’ factories who spread destabilising information, such as Hillary Clinton’s emails or the details of Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins’ asthma prescriptions. The aim is to undermine public respect for Western politicians and heroes alike.The fall of the Berlin Wall almost three decades ago was a remarkable triumph for freedom and capitalism over totalitarianism. But that ascendancy lulled Western politicians into a false sense of security.Russia, which has an economy no bigger than that of Britain or France, is showing daily that if resources are focused on a certain area – in this case cyber warfare – then a nation can still have lethal power.And we are only just coming to terms with it. Yesterday Lord Ricketts, who served as Britain’s National Security Adviser until 2012, warned that the recent plots are just the start, ‘pilot projects’ to test defences in advance of a full-blooded cyber assault to bring anarchy to the West.          Russian president Vladimir Putin waves to spectators prior to boarding a car after his arrival in New Delhi as the GRU\u0027s campaign of cyber warfare against the west was today exposedAs president Putin’s invasion of Crimea and his support for the Assad regime in Syria has shown, he is not a man constrained by normal democratic values. Throughout his presidency he has been pushing at boundaries, seeing what he can get away with, what will provoke the West to act.Now his dwindling popularity at home over his domestic agenda – particularly his attempt to raise the retirement age – makes it all the more imperative for him to wrap himself in the nationalist flag with high-profile attacks on the West.At least the complacency in Europe and America is beginning to lift and we are starting to fight back – as highlighted by the unprecedented news conference yesterday in which the Dutch defence minister, Ank Bijleveld, and Peter Wilson, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, explained how the OPCW conspiracy was foiled.In the context of cyber warfare, the West has unparalleled expertise. The staff of both the US National Security Agency and our own formidable base at GCHQ in Cheltenham have world-beating abilities in hacking computers and other electronic devices.So far the West has proved far more restrained than Russia in deploying that expertise. There is only one documented case of Western agents using a computer against an enemy state’s infrastructure. That occurred when the Israelis and the Americans worked together to release the Stuxnet virus into the computers that operated Iran’s nuclear programme. It proved what the West can do if necessary.But any escalation in cyber warfare is fraught with risk. A miscalculation by any rogue agents, anxious to ingratiate themselves with the Kremlin, could have disastrous consequences.We do well to remember that the new world disorder, which Putin promotes as well as relishes, is our new reality. "},{"url":null,"title":"Soho Airbnb listing offered vanlife experience guests sleep van just 69 night","story":"    The legit Airbnb listing - that has since been removed - let visitors say they stayed in Soho while not having the most ideal high end experienceThe listing claimed to offer a great location and affordable place \u0027in the best NY neighborhood.\u0027 Guests were even given pillows and blankets. The van was listed as an \u0027entire apartment\u0027 but guests had to use bathrooms nearby and use a free guest pass in order to go to a nearby gym and use their showers.  Might be time to switch to plastic?

The group are accused of a range of attacks on institutions and iniduals around the world. The attacks are linked to Russian attempts to spy on investigations into doping in sport, politics in the Ukraine and the US, and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the UK  After the Dutch named four men it caught hacking The Hague, US authorities released images of Artem Malyshev, 30, Ivan Yermakov, 32, and Dmitriy Badin, 27 (pictured, left to right), who it named as GRU hackers  CCTV images show Alexey Minin (left), while Oleg Sotnikov (right) is pictured on a photo recovered from a phone. They are both alleged to be members of the GRU\u0027s hacking squad, who were unmasked today          Evgenii Serebriakov was among four Russians trying to hack chemical weapons inspectors and his laptop contained this selfie  at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil - revealing one of more than a dozen GRU missions across the globeSurveillance footage shows the moment Dutch intelligence officers descended on the scene and caught the four men outside the chemical weapons agency  Authorities released a picture of the car which was rigged up with hacking equipment          One of the many phones belonging to four Russian GRU officers is seen after they tried to destroy it when they were arrested  Pictures show the cache of equipment seized from the men. They attempted to smash up some of the phones (inset) when they realised authorities were on to them  These images, made available by the Dutch Ministry of Defence today, are said to show the hacking equipment that four Russian intelligence officers used for a cyber attack on the OPCW        Loverboy Lexa, footballer \u0027Zhenya\u0027 and a baby-faced kingpin who used the alias \u0027Karen Millen\u0027: Putin\u0027s \u0027dumb Bonds\u0027 hacking squad unmaskedThey were supposed to be top spies, hidden from the world and operating behind a veil of secrecy.But after Dutch, British and US authorities blew the lid off Putin\u0027s ham-fisted hacking squad yesterday, the identities of the GRU\u0027s \u0027Unit 26165\u0027 can now be revealed.The gang include computer geeks - who advertised themselves on Moscow dating websites and played in the city\u0027s amateur football leagues .They served alongside more hardened members of the Kremlin\u0027s security apparatus, who organised and oversaw the group\u0027s many trips abroad and acted as the hackers\u0027 minders.              Alexei Morenets, 41, is an officer in Russia\u0027s GRU and believed to be one of its top hackers - but also responsible for most extraordinary blunder of The Hague mission.It appears that Morenets inadvertently outed more than 300 other agents working for the GRU in Moscow.Investigators have found he travelled on a diplomatic passport using his  real names and date of birth.News agency Bellingcat, who revealed the true identities of the Salisbury assassins, say he is registered as living at the GRU\u0027s Military Academy in Moscow.Morenets\u0027 Lada is also registered at GRU’s cyber warfare department down the road - and investigators say by searching other vehicles registered to the same address they have identified 305 other members of the 26165 unit accused of hacking targets all over world.To add to Mr Putin’s embarrassment the leaked list includes his spies\u0027 names, dates of birth and mobile phone numbers - unmasking and effectively dismantling his most elite cyber attack unit.The online expert also uses the online nicknames Lexa and Alexey, according to the FBI, and even  uploaded a picture of his face to the website mylove.ru using a photograph taken in the Russian capital.When he wasn\u0027t targeting anti- doping agencies and helping spread fake news in a bid to level allegations of substance abuse at western athletes, the 41-year-old appeared to be seeking women aged 21 to 30 in Moscow.It was also possible to geolocate the profile to within 650 feet of the GRU headquarters. And the profile picture appears to have been taken close to the intelligence base. The famous Panasonic building is clearly in shot, indicating it was taken on Komsomolsky Prospekt.             Alexei Sergey Vich Morenets uploaded a picture of his face to the website mylove.ru using a photograph taken in the Russian capital               Evgenii Serebriakov, 37, also known as Zhenya, is believed to be hiding in Moscow.The cyber expert used an email with the name Casey Ryback, a character played by Steven Seagal in the film Under Siege, which tells the story of terrorists attacking an American ship.His laptop was packed with details about previous misisons and even contained selfies from the 2016 Olympics in Brazil where Russian athletes\u0027 doping samples were tampered with and US athletes\u0027 medical records leaked.His computer also had the Spiez laboratory in its search history and train tickets to Bern where a wanted to hack more chemical weapons inspectors. He was travelling under his real name and date of birth - and in another fatal error was registered as living at the GRU\u0027s Moscow headquarters.            Evgenii Serebriakov was among four Russians trying to hack chemical weapons inspectors and his laptop contained this selfie  at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil - revealing one of more than a dozen GRU missions across the globe              Artem Malyshev, 30, is described by the FBI as a \u0027senior lieutenant\u0027 in Unit 26165.Born in a small rural town near the picturesque Valdai National Park in the north west of Russia, he went on to become a member of the GRU\u0027s hacking unit.Documents released yesterday state he used the names \u0027djangomagicdev\u0027 and \u0027realblatr\u0027 online as part of the hacking conspiracy.The FBI want him over the hack on the 2016 US presidential election, with the indictment stating he stole and released documents \u0027to interfere with the election\u0027.He is also charged over a wider group of offences, related to hacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the US anti-doping agency.              Baby-faced Ivan Yermakov, 32, was born in the grim, industrial Chelyabinsk region of eastern Russia.US authorities say he was involved in one the first hacks attributed to Unit 26165, reconnaissance of Westinghouse Electric Company\u0027s (WEC) in Pennsylvania, a company involved in the supply of power to the Ukraine.FBI documents state he would often pose as women online.He used the names Kate S. Milton, James McMorgans and Karen W. Millen online.Yermakov was also involved in \u0027spearphishing\u0027 attacks on WADA in 2016, and activities at the Rio Olympics.              Dmitriy Badin, 27, is the youngest of the seven men named by the US yesterday as being part of the hacking group.He was previously named among 12 agents who allegingly hacked into American computers to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.He was born in  Kursk, close to Russia\u0027s border with Ukraine, a city which is forever associated with the Soviet Union\u0027s tank battle victory over the Nazis in the Second World War.He has previously been described as an \u0027Assistant Head of Department\u0027 in the GRU hacking squad.The latest FBI poster states he is wanted over \u0027computer intrusions of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other victim entities during the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics and afterward\u0027.              Hackers\u0027 minder and GRU spy  Alexey Minin, 46, appears to have been in The Hague to protect two hackers trying to break in the OPCW\u0027s WiFi.Bearded Minin is one of the oldest in the group and could be the man who stamped on his phone after being arrested in Holland in AprilThe FBI appear to know little about him including where he was born, his date of birth or if he has any aliases.But it is believed he is an intelligence officer who accompanies and protects GRU hackers on their worldwide trips.He is wanted for conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, the US State Department said yesterday.The FBI wanted poster also says he should be considered \u0027armed and dangerous\u0027 and he is believed to be in Russia.                Oleg Mikhailovich Sotnikov, 46, appears to be a Russian agent in Holland to protect the GRU\u0027s cyber experts.The FBI said he is wanted for money laundering offences in the US and may have been involved in criminal activities since 2014.Like his comrade Minin, little is known about him, including his real name because Sotnikov is believed to be his alias.He posed for a photograph found on  Serebriakov\u0027s laptop outside a Dutch station when they bought tickets for their next mission in Bern.But the team never made it to Switzerland after they were arrested in the Marriott in The Hague and deported from Holland.Sotnikov is considered armed and dangerous and believed to be in Russia.             The GRU - an acronym for Glavnoye razvedyvatel\u0027noye upravleniye or Main Intelligence Directorate - was founded in 1918 after Lenin\u0027s Bolshevik Revolution.Lenin insisted on its independence from other secret services and the GRU was seen as a rival by other Soviet secret services, such as the KGB.According to Yuri Shvets, a former KGB agent, GRU officers were referred to as \u0027boots\u0027 - tough but unsophisticated.\u0027The GRU took its officers from the trenches,\u0027 he said, whereas KGB picked its agents from the USSR\u0027s best universities.The GRU would train agents and then send them to represent the Soviet Union abroad as military attaches in foreign embassies, according to historian John Barron.But once a member of the GRU, it is believed to be exceptionally difficult to leave. And those who do so to joined foreign agencies were punished savagely.Viktor Suvorov, a GRU officer who defected to Britain in 1978, said new recruits were shown a video of a traitor from the agency being burned alive in a furnace as a warning.Unlike the KGB, the GRU was not split up when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.It has a special status and answers directly to the chief of the general staff, one of the three people who control Russia\u0027s portable nuclear control system.GRU chiefs are reportedly picked by Putin himself.The GRU is now considered Russia\u0027s largest foreign intelligence service, according to Reuters, dwarfing Moscow\u0027s better-known Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), which is the successor to the KGB\u0027s First Chief Directorate.Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in GRU , was considered by the Kremlin to be one of the most damaging spies of his generation.He was responsible for unmasking dozens of secret agents threatening Western interests by operating undercover in Europe.Col Skripal, 66, allegedly received £78,000 in exchange for taking huge risks to pass classified information to MI6.In 2006, he was sentenced to 13 years in a Russian labour camp after being convicted of passing invaluable Russian secrets to the UK.A senior source in Moscow said at the time: \u0027This man is a big hero for MI6.\u0027                                                       Unit 26165\u0027s trail of blunders: How Putin’s elite globe-trotting hacking squad left a trail of clues including a selfie at the Olympics, a pile of beer cans and a TAXI RECEIPT from their spy base to airportWestern intelligence yesterday revealed the trail of clues that bungling Russian spies known as Unit 26165 left in their wake as they waged a war of disinformation across the globe.Kremlin agents working for the GRU targeted FIFA, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Organisation for the Prevention of the use of Chemical Weapons as it investigated both the Salisbury novichok attack in the UK as well as the Douma chemical weapons attack in Syria, the international investigation of the downing of MH17 and a US company providing nuclear power to Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin\u0027s elite squad even created the fake \u0027hacktivist\u0027 group Fancy Bears to disseminate misleading statements designed to exonerate Russia of doping allegations and instead level them at the US.But it was yesterday revealed that the spies left a trail of clues including blunder after blunder during their international campaign.             The team of four GRU officers travelling on official Russian passports entered the Netherlands on April 10 – but it turned out that two of them were carrying documents with consecutive passport numbers      bellingcat -

It just may be that in my view, he’s not the right man for the court at this time.\u0027In an 11th-hour wrinkle, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines reminded GOP leadership that his daughter\u0027s wedding will keep him two time zones away on Saturday.If Manchin, the lone undecided Democrat, decides to side with Republicans rather than invite the wrath of President Donald Trump in a state he carried in a 42 percentage-point landslide, Republicans will be able to have their way without Daines.Otherwise, the vote could be left open until he returns Sunday to cast the deciding vote. \u0027This is all going to work out,\u0027 Daines told reporters Friday morning at the Capitol. \u0027We’re going to have a new Supreme Court justice this weekend and I’m going to get to walk my daughter down the aisle,\u0027 he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said onthe Senate floor that Democrats were intent on defending allegations for which there was \u0027no corroborating evidence.\u0027 \u0027Uncorroborated mud and partisan noise ... will not have the final say around here,\u0027 he said. \u0027Facts matter.

A video clip showing her naked was found on his computer.It was months after the incidents that the victim became aware she had been filmed by Horsey when police showed her the video clip. She soon began suffering from hysterical outbursts and developed a tremor, the court heard.Horsey had rolled his eyes to the ceiling when a jury of seven women and five men convicted him of one count of voyuerism in a unanimous verdict at Guildford Crown Court.\u0027Reformed terrorist\u0027, 38, who appeared on BBC Newsnight and...Diamond thieves who plotted to steal £1m worth of gems in a...Share this articleThe 59-year-old had denied locking himself into an adjacent study at the house in Guildford, to clamber up a step-ladder to film one tenant  through a gap in the window above the bathroom door, the court had been told.The director, who provides financial services for around 150 dentists, claimed the step-ladder was to \u0027swat away cobwebs off the ceiling\u0027 and \u0027change light bulbs\u0027 and he had never entered the bathroom in his 10 years of owning the four-bedroom home.A one-minute mobile phone clip was found copied onto the father-of-two\u0027s well-organised laptop in a file labelled \u0027Good Files\u0027 but he claimed he had never seen the file or video and instead blamed one of the women\u0027s boyfriends for taking the footage.          Police found a video of one of his former tenants taken while she was having a showerHis victim had moved out of the house after staying there for about five or six months but it wasn\u0027t until the summer of 2016 that police made her aware that there was a video of herself in the bathroom taking a shower.Selena Jones, prosecuting at Guildford Crown Court, read out a lengthy victim impact statement written by the woman, who suffers with anxiety. Horsey had secretly filmed while she showered in his rental home.Ms Jones told the court the victim had written: \u0027Like everyone, I would like to call myself a strong and powerful woman but this incident has affected my anxiety to a large extent.\u0027Although nothing physically was done to me, seeing the footage leaves me feeling very anxious.\u0027The evening spent in the police station was fine. However, when I was in bed later that night, the realisation of what had happened hit me and I experienced hysterical outbursts leading to a panic attack. I couldn\u0027t believe this had happened to me.\u0027The worst situation was having to tell my father and my partner, the two men I respect most in the world.\u0027It is silly to think, but I can\u0027t help thinking that I have done something wrong. I found myself initially thinking about how naive I must have been to let this happen.\u0027There were occasions with Mark (the landlord) when he noticed my tremors which I have, especially when people are watching me. I explained my tremor to Mark, I am happy to talk about it because it\u0027s a part of who I am.\u0027Mark\u0027s reaction was along the lines of don\u0027t you want to get better? and I can help you. Throughout I felt quite patronised by his words. I felt like he was saying there was something wrong with me, viewing me as a naive young girl and patronising me.\u0027I am left with something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.\u0027Horsey had micro-managed the lives of his young professional female tenants by demanding the victim took a shower in the morning and the other two women were to wash in the evening.A tenant had put a sheet of paper in the window so as to block the gap above the bathroom door, but Horsey took down that sheet of paper and said it could damage the glass and didn\u0027t look good.He also posted up \u0027rules\u0027 on a laminated card on the wall saying it was \u0027okay to stand up while showering,\u0027 the court heard.Stephen Moses QC, defending, said: \u0027Mr Horsey admits his behaviour.

There has been no repeat behaviour since then.\u0027Give him the benefit of the doubt to allow for those matters.\u0027Judge Black, referring to the victim statement, told Horsey, of Golf Links Avenue, Hindhead, Surrey, : \u0027You need to understand that your behaviour towards her has affected her psychologically and will continue to do so for many years.\u0027She was a strong, intelligent woman - she now has panic attacks and her anxiety levels have increased.\u0027\u0027However, I believe you are someone who would work with the probation service and I can suspend the sentence of imprisonment for today.\u0027Judge Black imposed a nine month jail sentence, suspended for 18 months and ordered Horsey to sign up to the sex offenders register for 10 years.Horsey was also ordered to complete 25 days of rehabilitative service, pay damages of £3,600 and forfeit his laptop and hard-drive, which officers had confiscated after raiding his £650,000 home, for destruction.Given freedom to leave, white-haired Horsey bowed his head and followed the probation officer out of the court. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/22/12/4E7BB73000000578-0-image-a-12_1532257796124.jpg","title":"Moment car valet worker faces difficult job removes 200 stickers leased car","story":"Both the exterior of the Smart car (left) as well as the interior (right) had been covered in silver stickersThe car was due to be returned within days by the customer, who suffers from dementia and faced massive penalties for his customised bodywork.Adam, from Sunderland spent up to four hours prising off the stickers, which were more than an inch thick on the steering wheel.While his efforts were impressive, his \u0027after\u0027 clips showed there was still some damage to the motor.Is this fair?

In 1987, she served as Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation for the state of Maine and later as the New England regional director of the Small Business Administration in 1992.After relocating to Massachusetts to serve as the state’s Deputy State Treasurer in 1993, she returned to her native Maine in 1994 to launch a gubernatorial bid for the state’s governorship, becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major political party for the position of Governor of Maine.However, she ultimately lost the election to Angus King, who would later serve alongside her in the United States Senate.After working in the private sector, Collins again launched another political bid and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, formally taking her position as Senator the following year.          Brett Kavanaugh, above, faces an extremely close confirmation battle ahead in the U.S. SenateA moderate Republican, she was reelected in 2002, 2008 and 2014. In the Senate, Collins has played a key role on many issues and chaired the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee from 2003 to 2007.In the 2016 election, she stated that should would not support the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican standard bearer and has had a mixed record on supporting Trump after his surprise election victory, voting in favor of his proposed tax cuts in December 2017 but also opposing the President’s controversial temporary ban on travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and his family separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border.Collins has also emerged as a key swing vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, being set to unveil her final decision on October 5 ahead of the final vote in the U.S. Senate.How old is Susan Collins?Susan Collins is 65 years old.She was born on December 7, 1952.          Collins has served in the Senate since 1997 and considered a leading moderate voice thereWho is Susan Collins’s husband?Susan Collins’s husband is Thomas Daffron.The couple has been married since 2012.What is Susan Collins’s net worth?According to Open Secrets, Collins’s net worth is believed to be about $3.7 million (£2.8m).She is believed to draw her wealth from both her years of government service and through various financial investments.Susan Collins vote on KavanaughIn the lead-up to the final vote on the controversial nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Republican Senator has emerged as a critical swing vote who could ultimately decide the balance of the highest court in the United States for decades to come.Collins, who has not yet publicly decided whether she’ll vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, has revealed that she’ll announce her decision at 3pm EST on Friday, October 5.          Senator Susan Collins will soon reveal how she intends to vote 3pm EST on Friday, October 5During a procedural vote on the morning of October 5, Collins joined other swing vote Senators like Jeff Flake and Democrat Joe Manchin in advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination to a final floor vote on October 6. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican known for bucking her party, voted against advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination.Despite voting in favor of the procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh, Collins is still undecided – at least publicly – as to whether she’ll ultimately vote to confirm him, creating much uncertainty as to whether the Supreme Court nominee has enough votes to ultimately be confirmed as the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice.The Republicans’ narrow Senate majority means that they can only afford to lose one vote if all Democrats vote against Kavanaugh and Vice President Mike Pence casts the tiebreaking vote in Kavanaugh’s favor.In addition to Collins, Senators Flake, Murkowski and Manchin have not yet publicly announced how they will vote on the planned final floor vote on Saturday, October 6.Who is Susan Collins?

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

Now it’s back – and newly relevant in the ‘pre-fascist’ Trump era. He explains whyI should not have been entirely surprised when I saw How to Read Donald Duck, a book I had written with the Belgian sociologist Armand Mattelart, being burned on TV by Chilean soldiers. It was mid-September 1973 and a military coup had just toppled Salvador Allende, the country’s president, terminating his remarkable experiment of building socialism through peaceful means.I was in a safe house when I witnessed my book – along with hundreds of other subversive volumes – being consigned to the inquisitorial pyre. One of the reasons I had gone into hiding, besides my fervent participation in the revolutionary government that had just been overthrown, was the hatred the Donald Duck book had elicited among the new authorities of Chile and their rightwing civilian accomplices.We had received death threats, an irate woman had tried to run me over and neighbours – accompanied by their children – had stoned the house where my wife, Angélica, and I lived in Santiago, shouting: “Long live Donald Duck!” It was later discovered that the 5,000 copies of the third printing of the book had been taken from a warehouse by the Chilean navy and cast into the bay of Valparaíso.What had we done to incur such enmity?Armand and I had denounced Walt Disney as an agent of American cultural imperialism, incarnated in the life, adventures and misdeeds of Donald Duck, that innocuous icon, then one of the most popular characters in the world. Probing hundreds of Disney comic strips – sold by the million on newsstands in Chile and countless other lands – we had tried to reveal the ideological messages that underlay those supposedly innocent, supposedly apolitical stories.We wanted Chilean readers to realise they were being fed values that were inimical to a revolution that sought to unshackle them from centuries-old exploitation: competition rather than solidarity, prejudice rather than critical thinking, obedience rather than rebellion, paternalism rather than resistance, money rather than compassion as the standard of worth.It was not enough, we felt, to change the economic and social structures that benefited a rich minority and their international corporate allies. It was also imperative to understand how the previous rulers of our land had presented this subjugation as normal, natural and benign how they had been covertly selling us an American model of success and consumer affluence as the false solution to poverty and misdevelopment. Just as copper and other resources usurped by foreign hands needed to be recovered for the nation, so too did our dreams and desires. We had to take back control, forge a new identity, devise new forms of entertainment. Our book was meant to contest the authoritarian plots imported from the US, to open spaces for stories of our own making.Described in this summary fashion, How to Read Donald Duck might seem like another dreary academic, jargon-filled leftwing semiotic exercise condemning the bourgeois, capitalist, neocolonial cultural impositions. Although Armand and I were indeed university professors – and our research was underpinned by knowledge of Cervantes, Shakespeare, Umberto Eco and Antonio Gramsci – the language of our diatribe was accessible, playful, mocking and vivacious.We used the Disney cartoons to suggest the aseptic, oppressive sexuality in the Duck family, the way third-world natives were depicted as savages and idiots, the way riches were never produced by workers but always by investors, and how villains were portrayed with racial bias. In this realm, female Ducks are flirtatiously worried about their beauty, yet strangely asexual (Daisy: “If you teach me to skate this afternoon, I will give you something you always wanted.” Donald: “You mean …?” Daisy: “Yes … my 1872 coin.”) And the model jobs for the Duck nephews when playing a game at school about the adults they want to become: “I’d like to be a banker!” says Dewey, echoed by Huey: “I’ll pretend I’m a big landlord with lots of land to sell.” Or take the witch doctor who brags about his nation being modern because “Gottee telephone. Only trouble is only one has wires. It’s a hot line to the World Loan Bank.”Our book tried to be as amusing as the Duck we were disparaging, determined to compete with the very tales we were skewering. Perhaps it was this boisterous, sardonic tone that most infuriated the defenders of Disney as a paragon of virtue, as the wholesome king of innocence, as the uncle with the keys to the Magic Kingdom and eternal childhood. Was nothing sacred?The book was also meant to serve a practical purpose. For the first time in history, the leftwing Allende government had the resources (TV stations, film studios, magazines, large publishing houses) to produce its own mass media stories. One way to facilitate a broad range of alternative narratives was to unmask the strategies of dominant culture as it manipulated and seduced consumers. With this in mind, How to Read Donald Duck was conceived as an instrument for the liberation of workers, students, intellectuals in the struggle for a more equitable Chile.It made some sort of perverse sense, therefore, that a book that had been the product of the Allende revolution would suffer the sort of violence that the new military overlords of the country were perpetrating against so many supporters of the socialist government. The readers, real and prospective, of our Duck book were being executed, tortured, exiled and imprisoned (several soccer stadiums had to be turned into concentration camps to jail the many followers of the deposed president): a way of teaching the upstarts a lesson, to make sure they never again ventured to envision a different world.Words, however, have a way of persisting beyond repression and censorship. How to Read Donald Duck – burned, drowned, forbidden in Chile – ended up having a life beyond our shores, as Armand and I discovered when, along with our families and our book, we escaped into exile. It was hailed as “a manual of decolonisation” by the art critic John Berger and translated into more than a dozen languages, among them English.That edition was brought out in 1975 by a small London-based publishing house, which attempted to export 4,000 copies to the US. The whole consignment was seized, however, by customs acting on behalf of Disney lawyers, who accused the authors of piracy because we had, without authorisation, reproduced images that were part of their copyright. Represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, we won that suit, establishing what scholars have deemed to be a landmark case for freedom and fair use.Disney might have lost that skirmish but it has, thus far, won the war for the soul of humanity. It is now one of the largest entertainment conglomerates in the world and keeps gobbling up companies (the latest: Twentieth Century Fox). We had insolently threatened to roast the Duck. Instead the Duck seems to be devouring us and the legacy we will leave to our children.Even so, the book – which is now being published for the first time in the US and handsomely reprinted in the UK – may yet prove to be relevant in the pre-fascist era of Trump, Brexit and resurgent nationalisms all too reminiscent of the post-coup Chile of General Augusto Pinochet.Dashed out in 10 feverish days, in the throes of a peaceful insurgency that beckoned with other urgent tasks, the book would not have been written in the same way in this new era. I try to be more attentive today to the complexity of cultural interchange, the fact that not everything generated by cultural workers in countries such as Chile is inspiring – and not all mass-media products absorbed from abroad, including the US, are negative. The Disney Corporation itself has evolved under pressure from minorities and feminists, and has distinguished itself by defending LGBTQ rights.As I state in my memoir of the Allende years, Heading South, Looking North, it was perhaps misguided to assume that “millions of people in faraway lands are empty, innocent vessels into which the Empire passively pours its song, instead of tangled, hybrid, wily creatures ready to appropriate and despoil the messages that come their way”.However, the values we impaled in our book – greed, ultra-competitiveness, overarching inidualism, subjection of people with darker skins, derision of foreigners and immigrants (Mexicans, Muslims, Asians), suspicion of organised labour, a cult of wasteful consumerism, all of it sweetened by a false credo of unattainable happiness – are what animate many of those who enthusiastically embrace Trump and too many other bullying leaders as saviours promising a mythical past of nonexistent purity.Though I stand by the scrutiny to which we subjected Disney’s falsely innocent world, what most matters to me today, what I cherish above all in what we wrote, is the joy that remains the book’s most incandescent feature – the joy of the Chilean people who did not fear to march towards the future, daring to redefine reality. In this time of dire crisis, perhaps our book can add its tiny seed to the struggle for a better humanity, which seems more necessary than ever on our imperilled planet.• Ariel Dorfman, an emeritus professor of literature at Duke University in North Carolina, is the author of many works, including the play Death and the Maiden and, recently, the novel Darwin’s Ghosts, as well as the essay collection Homeland Security Ate My Speech.

Now it is centre stage of global politics. What does it offer the modern world, asks Neil MacGregorIt must surely be one of the most beguiling and evocative posters of the 1970s. High above the Earth, floating serenely among the stars and loosely tethered to a speeding spaceship, Yuri Gagarin smiles out at us and salutes. The first man in space is dressed in brilliant communist red, and emblazoned on his helmet are the letters CCCP (the Russian initials for the USSR). Above the skies, he looks around and tells us what he can see, or rather what he can not see: Boga Nyet!: There is no God! Below him are the toppling towers and domes of churches and mosques, left behind and condemned to imminent collapse by the soaring achievements of Soviet science. The old religions are withering away. Reason and research have raised humanity to a new idea of heaven – we can now all join Gagarin in an achievable paradise, empty of ine beings, and full instead of starry promise.A photograph taken 42 years later, in May 2017, is an equally compelling image of our own decade. It shows what popular songs long regarded as perhaps the nearest thing to heaven on earth – Paris in the springtime. But this is no romantic glimpse of the world’s favourite tourist destination. We are in the working-class suburb of Clichy. In the square in front of the mairie, beneath the French tricolour and the stars of the European Union, and under the watchful eyes of the police, God is being defiantly worshipped on the public highway. Hundreds of Muslim men are kneeling in prayer to protest at the closure of their unauthorised mosque. The secular French state, its republican values built on the basis of an absolutely non-negotiable laïcité (secularism), is being peacefully but fundamentally challenged by a group claiming the right to be loyal French citizens while asserting that they (and millions of others) also have rights as members of a religious community. As the notorious row about the burkini showed just a few years ago, these are not claims that France finds it easy to accommodate.Both images are entirely characteristic of their time, with resonances far beyond their place. The Soviet poster was of course devised as propaganda, but the assumptions behind it were very widely shared. In the 1970s, most politicians in the US and western Europe, as in the USSR, broadly believed that scientific advance, material progress and growing prosperity would lead to the continuing retreat of faith from the public realm. Just as important, nearly all shared the view later articulated in Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, that the most significant political determinant would ultimately be “the economy, stupid”.All that has changed. In the Russia that has emerged from the wreckage of the USSR, state atheism is decidedly a thing of the past. The country now defines itself loudly and proudly as Orthodox. President Putin is ostentatiously devout. The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, dynamited on Stalin’s orders in 1931, has been meticulously rebuilt. Even the KGB has its own church. Beyond Russia, the competitive materialisms of the cold war have been in large measure dislodged, or at least recast, by a different discourse. To an extent rarely seen in Europe since the 17th century, faith now shapes a significant part of the global public debate.The whole of the Middle East is caught up in murderous conflicts that are articulated and fought out in religious as much as economic terms. In Indonesia and Nigeria, Myanmar and Egypt, communities are attacked and iniduals killed on the pretext that the practice of their faith makes them aliens in their own country. India, whose constitution enshrines the state’s equidistance from all religions, is convulsed by calls for the government to assert an explicitly Hindu identity, with grave consequences for the hundreds of millions of Indians who are Muslims, Christians or belong to other faiths. In many countries, among them the US, immigration policy – which usually means the case against immigrants – is often debated in the language of religion.Even in a largely agnostic Europe, the French street protest is part of a similar trend. The Bavarian first minister has recently urged the presence of the cross in official buildings as the marker of a Catholic Bavarian identity (even though the Catholic church opposed the idea). In 2009, a nationwide referendum in Switzerland decided to ban the building of minarets while for the last few years thousands have been marching regularly in Dresden to protest against the alleged “Islamisation” of Europe. The most populous country on Earth, China, claims that its national interests, the very integrity of the state, are threatened by the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, the Dalai Lama, a man whose only power is the faith he embodies.Belief is back. Around the world, religion is once again politically centre stage. It is a development that seems to surprise and bewilder, indeed often to anger, the agnostic, prosperous west. Yet if we do not understand why religion can mobilise communities in this way, we have little chance of successfully managing the consequences.If one had to choose a tipping point, a specific moment at which this change crystallised, it would probably be the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. Deeply shocking to the secular world, it appeared at the time to be pushing against the tide of history: now it seems instead to have been the harbinger of its turning. After decades of humiliating intervention by the British and the Americans, dissenting Iranian politicians – many of them far from devout – saw in the forms of Iranian Shi’ism a way of defining and asserting the country’s identity against the outsiders. The mosque, even more than the bazaar, was the space in which new national narratives could be devised and in which all of society could engage. Ten years later, the Lutheran churches of East Germany played a comparable role for those resisting and ultimately overthrowing an oppressive state sustained in office by the armies of the Soviet Union. In both cases, faith structures (literal and metaphorical) were for a time seen not as oppression, but as frameworks for freedom.Many states since then have followed a similar path. In a way that could hardly have been imagined 60 years ago, the reassuring politics of prosperity have in many parts of the world been replaced by the often violent rhetoric and politics of identity, articulated through religion. This should not surprise us. It is a return to the pattern prevalent in almost all societies through history for along with language and nationalism, religion is one of the most powerful forces for shaping and energising a community. Not because it is a structure of control (though it is often crushingly that), but because it gives the group a narrative of who they are and what, together, they can become. Religion in its social dimension is less about escapism or consolation, than about hope, new behaviour and the challenge of struggling towards the future.“We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” Joan Didion’s famous sentence is not a reflection on religion, but it speaks to exactly that compelling need we all have for stories that give shape and significance to our inidual lives. Religious stories are part of a similar strategy, but for communal survival. Addressing the conundrums of life and death, they offer not explanation but meaning. As much about the future as the past, they provide a society with a narrative that goes far beyond the self, embracing the living, the dead and those still to be born in one continuing story of belonging. Not surprisingly, evidence from the ice age onwards suggests that societies with such narratives appear better equipped to overcome threats to their existence, to survive and to flourish. At the beginning of the 20th century, the French sociologist Émile Durkheim argued that there can in fact be no society unless it has such shared overarching stories, what he called “an idea that it constructs of itself”: that shared communal idea – or ideal – and its narratives were the precondition of a functioning society. We are, as a group, the stories that we tell about ourselves. If, for whatever reason, we lose or forget those narratives, we collectively no longer exist. In the rituals and ceremonies in which they are enacted, the society may be worshipping a remote, perhaps even a non-existent, god: it is also, Durkheim suggested, venerating an ideal version of itself, which may one day be made real.Such narratives of faith can create wonderfully potent symbols of solidarity. One example: Hindus in Bengal celebrate every autumn the return of the goddess Durga and her triumph over the forces of evil. To mark the festival they make each year a new statue of the deity. These painted representations of the goddess are made, not by a solitary artist, but in effect by the whole community. Supported by a wicker frame, the bulk of the body is composed of clay. But great efforts are made to incorporate bits of earth from all the different parts of the locality, from rich areas as well as poor. By convention, for the final mix, a priest should beg for some soil from a sex worker’s house, and there should ideally also be some clay from the banks of the Ganges, as Durga has a close connection to the river. The result is that in the temporary statue of the goddess every part of the community – rich and poor, weak and strong – is represented and honoured, and directly connected to the endlessly renewing, life-giving river. The image Durga comes to “inhabit” during her festival that the people venerate thus carries within it the whole place and the whole community, physically and symbolically present. It is an image endlessly made, destroyed and remade by the people themselves. Few political structures have found metaphors so emotionally compelling for a society in which everybody has their place.The power of such narratives, beliefs and rituals to sustain communities through danger and across centuries is a recurrent fact of history. It is a central part of the story of the Jews after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70AD and the brutal campaigns of Hadrian of the people of Ethiopia, alone in Africa in resisting the colonial invaders and of the African slaves transported to the Americas. In such circumstances, religion offers an architecture of meaning in which people may find shelter and hope. For many today, in areas of economic disruption and dysfunctional states, it may be the only architecture available. And it is surely part of the reason why across much of the world, belief is back.It is a view of religion with which many Europeans struggle. It is not just that the rational mind rejects as scientifically untrue the theological or mythological frameworks of faith, or that beliefs have over millennia been consciously manipulated by rulers and priests to support the powerful, and to exclude and persecute whole sections of society. The Holocaust and the many moral failures of both Catholic and Protestant churches in the face of Nazi evil have been followed by their long institutional refusals to embrace widely shared ideals of equality. Many find it hard to see here forces that will shape a better world, which perhaps explains the growing focus across the west on the inidual quest for truth and for private spirituality.But this risks blinding us to the power of narratives that articulate an ideal, that offer fulfilment in the context of a community, make demands on everyone, and – above all – hold out hope. It may be a matter for regret, it may represent a failure of secular politics, but it should certainly be no surprise that so many societies now see in such narratives of faith their best way forward. • Living With the Gods by Neil MacGregor is published by Allen Lane (RRP £30).

Its shares have been under pressure since a £3.4bn takeover by rival Hammerson fell through earlier this year.In an announcement after the close of trading on Thursday, Whittaker’s group said: “The consortium’s consideration of the possible offer is at a preliminary and exploratory stage and no approach has been made to the board of Intu.”Intu said it had not received an approach from the consortium but added: “The board has formed an independent committee comprising all directors of Intu other than John Whittaker, who is connected to the consortium.”“The independent committee will consider any approach from the consortium, if made, and a further announcement will be made if and when appropriate.” The consortium has until 1 November to make a firm offer for Intu.Financial pressure on Intu is expected to increase as tenants including New Look, Toys R Us and Prezzo restructure or enter administration.“Intu thought this was a cyclical problem ... whereas our point is this is a secular shift to internet shopping, that you have the wrong asset class,” said hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, which has a long-term short position in Intu.Peel Hunt analysts ruled out the possibility of competing bids, given the size of the consortium’s existing shareholding, and said a takeover could offer an opportunity to take the company private. Analysts said such a move would enable the issues facing the business to be handled “outside the public glare” and that any offer would be at a material discount to net asset value.“An offer at 190-200p per share may therefore provide the consortium with potential upside but would it be attractive enough for the remaining Intu shareholders?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d8a3bc6c969c32adfc5589f2729e1419f31b72/22_375_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9cd589d63878c29760c70c4ee2dc21b","title":"man who got swagger back for aston martin is ready for long game stock market","story":"Andy Palmer has written himself into the history books. The Aston Martin chief executive has done something this week that nobody has done for almost 30 years – float a car company on the London Stock Exchange.It doesn’t sound like much. But UK investors are notoriously averse to the thrills and spills offered by car manufacturers, preferring the more esoteric world of outsourcers, service providers and financial firms.In an upstairs room at the London Stock Exchange, immediately after the first dealings, Palmer looked tired but elated – probably just like a boss should look after dragging a loss-making carmaker back from the brink of extinction to the floor of the London Stock Exchange inside four years.The Midlands-based sports car manufacturer, however, appears to have bucked that trend. It has doubled production of its elegant vehicles to 7,000 a year and plans to double again by 2022. The confidence in Aston’s future prospects is rooted in a new factory, just outside Cardiff, which begins production of a new sports utility vehicle (SUV) early next year and will also be the base for its future electric vehicles.“We are still growing when the market is down,” he says. “Which is proof of how insulated we are.”Palmer stands to pocket about £24m from a four-year share-based incentive scheme. Not bad for a working-class boy who grew up with his brother, who is five years younger, only four miles down the road from Aston’s base in Warwickshire. His father was an engineer, his mother a secretary.Palmer also did his apprenticeship down the road at a car parts firm in Leamington Spa 38 years ago. That led to a job at Austin Rover, where he worked on upgrading the Mini and first encountered the jaw-dropping attention to detail that Honda brought to a joint venture.From that moment, Palmer was hooked on Japanese industrial practice. So off he went to Nissan, where he spent 24 years, including a 13-year stint in Japan.The 55-year-old doesn’t just talk the talk, though. He’s a bona fide “petrolhead”, who rides a BMW K1600 motorbike at weekends and races an Aston Martin Vantage GT4.Palmer may not be feeling much Brexit anxiety but, before jumping into the Aston hot seat in October 2014, he was the number three executive at Nissan Group, so he recognises the strain it is placing on his fellow captains of industry.Analysis by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders suggests that EU tariffs on cars alone could add at least an annual £2.7bn to imports and £1.8bn to exports. These import tariffs could push up the list price of cars imported to the UK from the continent by an average of £1,500.It is a stark prospect for Britain’s car-buying public, who are drawn to the badges of the big European players such as Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW.Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Ford, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, have all warned that a no-deal Brexit could have dire consequences for the future of their UK car factories.“In the industry, the UK is known as ‘treasure island’ because it’s usually one of the most profitable markets. Why? Because we like cars, so we usually upscale.By 3pm on Wednesday afternoon, Aston’s share price began to rally. Palmer’s spirits, like the stock, lifted momentarily. “That’s America waking up. Look, it’s the first day, so you can’t judge it based on one day,” he says of the early price fall.“We wanted to fill the book with long-only investors and not just go for the quick return.”The share price is at a level that reflects the earnings multiple (about 21 times) applied to New York-listed Ferrari, the other listed luxury car brand. Putting the Aston Martin brand alongside the more globally recognised Ferrari name is rewarding work for Palmer. It has been a long, hard road to get there, however.“The hardest day was in 2015, when I had to make 400 people redundant. That was the shittiest day,” he says. “The cost base was out of control and the management structure was upside down – we had too many managers. We went down to 1,800 people now we have more than 3,000. By 2022, we will have 5,000.”Palmer’s surgical approach may have been tough but he had few options. When he took the wheel at Aston the business was loss-making and there were huge concerns about its future.In 2015 and 2016, the marque made total losses of £291m. After the difficult cost cuts and debt refinancing was done, the business rallied. Last year, it clocked up a full-year profit of £84.5m and it has made further progress this year with a small increase in first-half pre-tax profit to £20.8m.“It was painful,” Palmer says. “The other hard thing was to change the company culture. It was cowering, like a beaten dog. I wanted to get a bit of the swagger back.”That now seems a distant memory for Palmer. The Aston boss reckons the luxury carmaker is no longer a cowering dog: “Aston Martin has got its mojo back,” he says. “It’s great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c678ee452e5e385e84129c56ee3dcaf038efe77/0_67_4566_2740/master/4566.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fef0deb181f08199af253efb35ecdb2","title":"article 50 europe labour brexit betrayal","story":"The main parties will fight to blame each other for ‘Brexit betrayal’, but only Labour can present a positive alternativeThe chaotic UK-EU Brexit negotiations can easily obscure some of the consistent elements: the Tories have prioritised their internal party conflict over getting a deal and the EU27 have the stronger bargaining position.The now-forgotten debate over Britain’s £35bn-plus “orce bill” was a harbinger of things to come: the EU will set out its position and the deal will broadly resemble the bloc’s offer. The article 50 process was designed to strengthen the hand of the remaining members in any exit negotiation. Over the past two years, it has worked as its creators intended – establishing a ticking clock towards a no-deal exit gives the EU huge leverage.This is not to say the EU wants a no-deal outcome. Negotiators have also suggested that they will offer Theresa May a vague political declaration about the future relationship, which would sit alongside a legally binding withdrawal treaty focused on citizen rights, financial obligations and the Irish border. Of these three aspects, it is the Irish border that still threatens to lead to the breakdown of the negotiations. The EU’s “backstop for Northern Ireland”, de facto keeping the territory within the regulatory and customs orbit of the EU to maintain a checkpoint-free Irish border, is unacceptable to a government in London dependent on DUP votes.Even if the Tories were united behind May at this crucial moment, the Irish border would still pose a huge challenge to getting a majority for a deal. This is why the Chequers proposal was a huge miscalculation. It was always going to be rejected by the EU for cherry-picking the single market, but also triggered opposition from Brexiters. If they remain true to their word and vote against May’s deal, then Britain is fast approaching a major political crisis. The barely disguised leadership ambitions on show at the Tory party conference – with hopefuls vaunting their Eurosceptic credentials to members with often ludicrous attacks on the EU – only deepens this dynamic and further erodes what is left of any goodwill Britain has in Brussels.May can probably still negotiate a “jam tomorrow” Brexit deal in Europe, but the possibility of her getting this through parliament looks remote. If a formulation on the Irish backstop can be agreed, such a deal would also suit the EU. It knows it will have even more leverage over Britain once the country is formally outside the bloc.How Labour responds to this situation will surely come to define Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. May’s deal will not pass even a watered-down version of Labour’s “six tests”. The agreement will be too vague to offer any of the guarantees on workers’ rights, environmental standards and the protection of British manufacturing jobs that Labour has demanded. Labour has said it will seek a new election in this situation, but the simple majority it requires in a no-confidence vote is not in the party’s gift. What’s more, even if it won the ensuing election it would not have time to carry out its own negotiation prior to 29 March 2019 – article 50 deadline day.The logic of the situation leads to a clear conclusion: Britain will have little choice but to unilaterally rescind its article 50 notice. As its author, Lord Kerr, has said: “The article is about voluntary withdrawal, not about expulsion: we don’t have to go if at any stage, within the two years, we decide we don’t want to.”Many Labour strategists will be terrified of this prospect. Isn’t this a betrayal of the Brexit vote? But a pause for reflection does not have to be negative. Labour should take the opportunity to engage in a national conversation about Britain’s relationship with Europe. This could be a huge exercise in local deliberative democracy, exploring the kind of Europe the British public would like to see. A key aim would be to raise the horizons of an often parochial Brexit debate. Labour could draw in left and centre-left parties across Europe, ensuring proposals escape the “them and us” logic of the current negotiations and contribute to efforts under way to achieve EU reform.A pause for reflection has clear merits. No one wants a rushed referendum amid a terrible political crisis. Labour strategists have sometimes suggested that the next election will be defined by who owns the “Brexit betrayal” narrative. But the recent conference showed there is a positive alternative to this: that the election can be won on the grounds of who has the best democratic offer to the British people. The outcome of a national consultation on Britain’s relationship with Europe, and the reforms the bloc needs, could then be negotiated with the EU and eventually ratified in a referendum. A reformed membership of the EU could win broader support.As Britain stares down the barrel of a no-deal Brexit, a party often accused by its foes of offering chaos could come to the rescue of a deeply traumatised nation.• Luke Cooper is a visiting fellow on the Europe’s Future programme at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, a senior lecturer in international politics at Anglia Ruskin University and a convenor of the Another Europe Is Possible campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382017a6584006528b66bddc4771935bbf51d9c6/79_327_4124_2474/master/4124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c084c36560951d3568358875197874fd","title":"closing schools spider children disconnected nature london","story":"Children are disconnected enough from nature as it is. By choosing fear over fact, these London schools only makes things worseIt should be a cause for celebration. In one of the most nature-denuded countries on the planet, in its most wildlife-starved city, on #worldanimalday, a rampaging creature caused the closure of four schools. Species other than humans are thriving in London!What terrifying creature has caused four headteachers to close their schools? A tiger escaped from a zoo? Britain’s first wild wolf for four centuries? A mastodon going berserk after being reconstructed by mad scientists? The first great white shark to be spotted in the Thames?No: the petrifying menace now imperilling young children’s educations, and causing massive headaches for working parents, is an ordinary, harmless species of spider.The noble false-widow spider is, as the professional entomologists of the charity Buglife put it, a ponderous, solitary and non-aggressive spider. It has lived among us, in our homes, schools, and no doubt, hospitals, for decades. According to Buglife, across the whole of Europe there are just two definitive cases of it ever biting someone. Both are described as a mild sting, about as bad as a wasp or a nettle. Have either of these dangerous species recently shut down a school? If we are rationally assessing risks, a bee would be more hazardous, a domestic dog far more dangerous – and let’s not terrify ourselves by properly considering those lethal metal beasts that prowl outside every school gate and emit toxic fumes every single day.This would be comic if it wasn’t so tragic. When politicians declare that people are fed up of experts, it spells trouble. When schools fail to consult experts, and pass ludicrous prejudices on to children, it is more than troubling.The headteachers ultimately decided to close their schools, but they took advice from somewhere. I’ve put a series of questions to Newham council, hoping to shed light on this advice. They haven’t responded so I can only surmise the teachers listened to someone on the council’s “environmental team” who knows nothing about spiders, Googled a bit, and panicked. Are these headteachers really so credulous that they didn’t think to contact a professional entomologist to properly evaluate the risk posed by this species?“The safety and wellbeing of pupils and staff is always our number one priority,” drones one school letter home (the three school letters I’ve seen are so similar they could’ve been drafted by the same person).Toxic insecticides would almost certainly pose more of a hazard to the children than an “infestation” of easily avoidable spiders. What kind of chemicals are being deployed? I’ve asked the council and, again, there’s been no reply. One headteacher has claimed his school could be closed until after half-term – nearly a month.We live in an era where we are more disconnected than ever from our fellow species, on whom we ultimately depend for our survival. We also live in a time when many schools are heroically defying financial pressures to provide more outdoor schooling for their pupils.Where best can we begin to learn about nature? The countryside? A forest? No. Right here. Wherever we are now – in a city, suburb or village. The presence of these spiders in Newham is a wonderful opportunity for children to learn about spiders’ lifestyles, their important ecological role and how our lives are enriched by the flora and fauna of planet Earth.Unfortunately it is not the children who need to be taught to respect and live alongside other species – it’s the teachers and all the other grownups who have created this ignorant insanity.• Patrick Barkham writes for the  on natural history"},{"url":null,"title":"stephen colbert on fbis kavanaugh inquiry the report is lacking in report","story":"Late-night comics discussed the disappointingly rushed investigation into supreme court nominee Brett KavanaughLate-night hosts took apart the FBI’s brief investigation into supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying it lasted “half a Scaramucci”.On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed the week-long investigation, the results of which have just been released to senators. “Before the FBI investigation, both sides were confused and angry,” he said. “Now both sides are confused and furious.”The White House released a positive statement at 2.30am, a time “typically when you release your drunkest tweets”.The report is being kept under lock and key, only able to be seen by a select few. “I would say they’re treating this report like the nuclear launch codes but then I remember, they have given the launch codes to an idiot,” he joked.Many of the potential interviewees weren’t contacted by the FBI, leading many to question the report’s worth. “Democrats would say the report is lacking in report,” he said.Included in the group of people not interviewed is Kavanaugh himself and his accuser Dr Christine Blasey Ford. “That’s like investigating an arson and saying we’re not really looking into the fire part,” he said.Colbert continued: “I’ve had more thorough investigations to find my AirPods.”On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also brought up his concerns over the report. “I don’t know if we can call a five-day investigation sufficient,” he said. “Although I get why the White House thinks it is. They’ve never spend five consecutive days on anything.”He joked that it “lasted half a Scaramucci”.Noah then spoke about the unimportance of its quality. “It doesn’t matter that this investigation was thorough,” he said. “What matters is that it gives these moderate Republicans the cover they need to vote yes.”He continued: “Basically Mitch McConnell conducted this process the same way a parent checks under their kid’s bed for monsters.”Ultimately, he doesn’t think that anything can stop Kavanaugh now. “I’m an optimist but it doesn’t seem like there’s much anybody can do besides wait and see,” he said. “We might as well go out and get drunk like Brett Kavanaugh and try to forget that this ever happened like Brett Kavanaugh.”On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host replayed clips from the past week, including Trump’s assertion that he would be a bad drunk. “You already scream and yell and slur your words like a stumbling drunk,” he joked.He moved on to the FBI investigation which he also found concerning. “They really went over this thing with a no-toothed comb,” he said.Reportedly, one potential character witness tried to contact the FBI directly but had to settle for their web portal. “No one should ever have to log on to the FBI’s web portal,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to contact the FBI the same way I pay my dentist.”He also detailed how many shortcuts the FBI reportedly took in its reporting. “You guys are like treasure hunters who decided to call it quits before you flipped over the map,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1473ea99027271d3b9edeb6aef037de5c7e81bd5/0_24_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bb91dde87a4f830ccfbf01f3538f6a8","title":"uk universities hiring superstar professors to boost research rankings","story":"Study says the government’s research rating framework is distorting university payBritish universities are imitating Premier League football clubs by poaching “superstar” talent, rewarding an elite group of professors with higher pay in order to boost their research rankings, according to a study.The research by a trio of economists at the University of Nottingham found the government’s research excellence framework (REF) – which rates departments by academic publications and impact – appears to have skewed pay towards professors with the most prolific output.The study confirms long-held fears among academics that higher education hiring and pay policies have been distorted by the REF, a periodic exercise that has a substantial influence over the destination of UK research funding.“While inidual UK academics and administrators will no doubt find these results of much interest, they warrant wider attention, as they contain important lessons on the effects of liberalising pay and introducing competition for resources in a largely publicly funded system,” the study concluded.John Gathergood, one of the authors of the paper presented to the Economic Policy panel meeting in Vienna, said the issue was likely to get worse in the next REF scheduled for 2021, when departments can nominate inidual staff with up to five publications rather than four in the last evaluation.“The impact of the REF is not neutral. It encourages universities to hire superstars because the benefits are quite substantial. And the benefits are going to be even higher in 2021 than last time,” Gathergood said.Because academics are able to move the affiliation of their published research across universities, he said a “transfer market” had sprung up as universities competed for staff.The paper by Gathergood and his colleagues Gianni De Fraja and Giovanni Facchini matched outcomes from the last REF with data on pay, and found that departments where professors got the highest average levels of pay also received the best REF performance measures.The REF’s measure of inidual publications, in particular, was associated with higher average levels of pay, while its measures of research impact and academic community – which were related to departments rather than identified iniduals – showed no association, the study found.The pay effect was seen across the board in universities, departments and subjects, among the more than 52,000 staff at the 154 institutions that took part in 2014. It also found that the boost from hiring a superstar was most marked in newer or less highly rated universities, compared with those in the research-intensive Russell Group of universities, such as Imperial College.But hiring or rewarding superstars could demoralise other staff in a department, according to Gathergood. Senior professors were able to earn up to seven times more than newly promoted professors on the lowest nationally agreed salary.“If you feel that you are working hard, and your university or your department hires an outsider as professor because they’ve got a lot of publications, then that probably feels very unfair,” Gathergood said.But departments with particularly unequal pay – meaning a bigger gap between superstars and the rest – were associated with better REF results, especially in arts and humanities subjects as well as sciences and engineering.The authors also noted another side-effect: those departments whose staff served as REF panel members – judging the research impact of their peers – seem to also have received higher ratings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c85abbcc6119c9e6fcc599d01935aa63231ae9a6/0_3_2414_1448/master/2414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f23735f7f229befcac80071ef17d59eb","title":"walkers answers critics with launch of uk crisp packet recycling plan","story":"Manufacturer to collect and repurpose packaging after campaign against firm’s wasteWalkers has agreed to offer a free national recycling scheme to stop millions of empty crisp packets ending up in landfill in the UK every year after consumers heaped pressure on it to change its plastic packaging.A social media campaign asking crisp manufacturers to make their packaging recyclable led to Royal Mail issuing a plea to members of the public last week to put empty crisp packets in an envelope before posting them back to the company.The Leicester-based company has been accused of adding to the plastic waste littering the streets and seas by producing more than 7,000 non-recyclable crisp packets every minute.But on Friday Walkers, owned by PepsiCo UK, announced the launch of a nationwide recycling scheme, claiming it was a first for Britain.From December, crisp eaters will be able to deposit empty packets, regardless of the brand, at hundreds of collection points or post them in a box or envelope free of charge to the recycling firm TerraCycle.UK consumers munch through 6bn packets of crisps a year. But although the inside of conventional packets are shiny and look like foil, they are a metallised plastic film. The government-funded body Recycle Now, part of its waste advisory body Wrap, says no packets are currently recyclable and that they should be put in the rubbish rather than the recycling bin.But Walkers insisted crisp packets were “technically recyclable, but the issue until now has been that they weren’t being separated or collected for recycling”.It said the collected packets would be cleaned, shredded, turned into small plastic pellets and then converted into “useful” plastic items such as benches, plant pots and fence posts.“We share people’s concerns about the amount of plastic in our environment and are working on a number of both short- and long-term solutions to reduce the impact of our packaging,” said Ian Ellington, general manager of PepsiCo UK. “Our new Walkers recycling initiative starts to tackle this issue right now by repurposing used crisp packets to create everyday items.”More than 332,000 people have signed a petition on the 38 Degrees website asking “Walkers and other manufacturers to change the materials for their packets to one which is recyclable or even more preferably a non-plastic environmentally friendly material”.David Babbs, the executive director of 38 Degrees, said: “We are delighted to hear that Walkers will now be recycling used crisp packets. It is proof that public pressure can shift big companies to do more to prevent waste.“But let’s not forget that there is still more for Walkers to do if they want to keep the public on side. The public will be watching to make sure the new recycling scheme isn’t just a PR stunt. And, most importantly, they have to make their crisp packets fully recyclable far sooner than 2025.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa896a200d9cfa2174e5f9f2c44aad4b097a4f3f/0_34_4029_2418/master/4029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f3e9649418c480d26856a6389b4c3f2","title":"why the next four months are crucial for future of planet climate change","story":"Two forthcoming major climate talks offer governments an opportunity to respond to this year’s extreme weather with decisive actionThe warning signals of climate change that have hit people around the world in the last few months must be heeded by national governments at key meetings later this year, political leaders and policy experts are urging, as the disruption from record-breaking weather continues in many regions.Extreme weather events have struck around the world – from the drought and record temperatures in northern Europe, to forest fires in the US, to heatwaves and drought in China, to an unusually strong monsoon that has devastated large areas of southern India.As the northern hemisphere summer closes, polar observations have just established that the Arctic sea ice narrowly missed a record low this year. The sea ice extent was tied for the sixth lowest on record with 2008 and 2010. Sea currents and wind conditions can have large effects on sea ice extent from year to year, but the trend is starkly evident.“Put simply, in the last 10 years the Arctic is melting faster than it ever has previously since records began,” said Julienne Stroeve, professor at University College London. “We have lost over half of the summer sea ice coverage since the late 1970’s and it is realistic to expect an ice-free Arctic sea in summer in the next few decades.”Of particular concern is the decline in thick ice which forms over several years. “The older ice has been replaced by more and more first-year ice, which is easier to melt out each summer,” she explained.Not all of the effects of this year’s extraordinary weather, which has also seen the UK’s joint hottest summer on record, can be traced directly to climate change. However, scientists are clear that the background of a warming planet has made extremes of temperature, and accompanying droughts and floods, more likely.This week, scientists are gathering in South Korea to draw together the last five years of advances in climate science to answer key questions for policymakers. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) celebrates its 30th birthday this year with what is likely to be a landmark report to be released on Monday 8 October. What is expected to emerge will be the strongest warning yet that these unusual occurrences will add up to a pattern that can only be overcome with drastic action.Thousands of the world’s leading climate experts collaborate on the periodic reports, released roughly every half-decade. They have grown clearer over the years in the certainty of their evidence that climate change is occurring as a result of human actions, and firmer in their warnings of the disruptive consequences.This time, the scientists will attempt to answer whether and how the world can meet the “aspiration” set in the Paris agreement of 2015 to hold warming to no more than 1.5C, beyond which many low-lying states and islands are likely to face dangerous sea level rises.When the scientists deliver their verdict, the onus will pass to politicians to translate their advice into concrete action. Already in recent weeks, global initiatives have begun aimed at doing so: the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco last month spurred protests, and dozens of local governments and multinational companies to make pledges the second One Planet Summit saw advances in climate finance while at the UN General Assembly, secretary general António Guterres urged world leaders to step up, calling climate change “the defining issue of our time”.Evidence showing that tackling climate change can be an economic boost rather than a brake has been growing. The recently published New Climate Economy report says more than 65m new low-carbon jobs could be created in just over a decade, and that 700,000 premature deaths from air pollution could be avoided every year by government action on climate change. A further $2.8tn could be added to government revenues by 2030 by reforming perverse incentives to burn fossil fuels.The existence of tipping points – thresholds of temperature beyond which certain natural processes become irreversible, such as the melting of permafrost, which may release the greenhouse gas methane and create runaway warming effects – is a key concern of many climate scientists. The faster emissions rise, the sooner we may unwittingly pass some of these key points.For all these reasons, the IPCC’s special report comes at a crucial point. Scientists and economists have warned that if the world cannot shift course within the next few years, the consequences will be dire, as new infrastructure built now – in energy generation, transport and the built environment – will be made either to low-emissions standards or in the high-emissions habits of the past. As the IPCC’s next comprehensive assessment of climate science will not be available until 2021, this year’s report will be vital in shaping policy.Ted Chaiban, director of programmes at Unicef, urged governments to seize the opportunities for action offered by this year’s series of political meetings offers for action. “Over the past few months, we have seen a stark vision of the world we are creating for future generations,” he said. “As more extreme weather events increase the number of emergencies and humanitarian crises, it is children who will pay the highest price,” he said.“It is vital that governments and the international community take concrete steps. The worst impacts of climate change are not inevitable, but the time for action is now.”After the IPCC publication, the world will face a key test of faith in the 2015 Paris agreement, the only global pact stipulating action on temperature rises. This December in Poland, the UN’s climate change arm will hold a two-week meeting aimed at turning the political resolve reached in Paris three years ago into a set of rules for countries to follow on reducing emissions.The political situation is more fraught than it was in the runup to Paris. The US is pulling out of the landmark climate agreement and is likely to play little part in the talks. Australia’s government is also in turmoil over climate actions. Now the challenger for Brazil’s presidency, Jair Bolsonaro, is threatening to withdraw its participation – a potential blow to the Paris consensus, as Brazil was a linchpin among rapidly developing nations.All eyes will be on China, which has shown remarkable progress on renewable energy and emissions reduction, and India, where climate champions have found common cause with opponents of increasingly damaging air pollution. Patricia Espinsoa, the UN’s top climate official, warned that only “uneven progress” had been made so far on the 300-page rulebook for implementing the Paris targets, leaving the rest of the work for December.While the dangerous weather of the first half of 2018 has raised concerns worldwide that we are seeing climate change in action, many leading experts told the  they were optimistic that political and business leaders this year would help set the world on a different course to avoid the worse predictions of untrammelled warming.Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said the past few years had seen “extraordinary progress” in areas such as renewable energy and the take-up of low-carbon technology: “This is real, not in the future but happening now. We are showing that we can do this, we can bring down emissions, it doesn’t need to be a disaster.”Adopting low-carbon aims now would set developing countries on a course to a brighter future, added Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former economic minister of Nigeria and a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. “Now is the time to do this, before we lock in high-carbon infrastructure,” she said. “Now is the opportunity for real sustainable growth.”Political leaders will find that global investors back them up in opting for low-carbon policies, predicted Frank Rijsberman of the Global Green Growth Institute. “I see this from investors, from businesses,” he said. “They are ready, and they see low-carbon as the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6e2088fc24c661dea90b6e428b96e3a62f3f78b/0_147_4715_2830/master/4715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218cab61ba136c7cc21dcf45fc6f4831","title":"fish dwindle traditionally rich waters tanzania kivukoni dar es salaam in pictures","story":"In Kivukoni fish market, the port city of Dar es Salaam boasts a thriving economic enterprise.

That illusive je ne sais quoi that’s eye-catching without being attention-seeking. See today’s sparkly, dangly earrings worn with her fine blond hair twisted into a perfectly imperfect messy bun. She can make an outfit that sounds chaotic on paper (say, a pleat skirt with a bright print blouse, ribbed socks, chunky pool slider shoes) look a match made in heaven, and make perfectly ordinary pieces (a man’s white shirt and black trousers) look exquisite by dint of a just-so sleeve roll and the ideal number of buttons undone.The house where she has lived in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, for 30 years is the same. Grand and yet slightly scruffy, it has one room painted pink and another yellow, and yet, somehow, an air of quiet harmony. My visit falls on one of the last warm, sunny mornings of the great summer of 2018 and Chambers has the doors open from her kitchen (garden flowers on the wooden table, seating nooks patchworked with cushions, holiday postcards cheek by jowl with classic photography) on to a veranda, white wooden boards foxed and flecked with age, where wicker chairs look on to a long, green garden. An antique silver candelabra with neon-yellow candles sits in front of a faded curtain of rose and white ticking stripe fabric.It is slightly bonkers, but surprisingly peaceful. From indoors comes the sound of the tongue-and-groove panelled doors of the many kitchen cupboards banging as Chambers hunts for the cafetiere. She eventually locates it after a phone call to her husband on his mobile upstairs, and brings coffee along with plates of pastries, pushing a huge vase of cut hydrangeas to one side.For two decades until last summer, it was this idiosyncratic taste for which Chambers was known, as fashion director of British Vogue and consultant at Marni and Prada. And then, in July 2017, two months after her departure from Vogue had been announced, as part of a slew of masthead changes accompanying the change in editor from Alexandra Shulman to Edward Enninful, a bracingly candid interview given to the little-known online journal Vestoj went viral. In it, Chambers burned bridges with the new Vogue regime by describing an unceremonious sacking by Enninful, claiming she “hadn’t read Vogue in years”, describing some of the clothes featured in the magazine as “ridiculously expensive” and a cover image styled by her of Alexa Chung in a “stupid” Michael Kors T-shirt as “crap”, rubbing salt into the wound by explaining “he’s a big advertiser so I knew why I had to do it”.Amid the changing of the guard at Vogue, Chambers was cast as part of the posh, white fashion establishment being dislodged by the new regime. Despite the accent (old-fashioned cut-glass) and being called Lucinda, Chambers does not, in fact, come from money and did not land at Vogue through connections. She inherited her flair for interiors from her mother, a single parent for most of Chambers’ childhood who funded family life by buying houses, doing them up and selling them on.Two photographers with whom Chambers often worked at Vogue, Mario Testino and Patrick Demarchelier, have since been accused of sexual misconduct, which they have denied. Chambers says she never witnessed any wrongdoing by either man. “I ran a tight ship on my shoots. I don’t think people would have dared. Only once in my career have I seen a photographer behave toward a model in a way that I considered unacceptable. I stopped the shoot and never worked with him again.”By the end of Chambers’ time at Marni, her role had expanded so that she was one of the designers – “there wasn’t a button or a fabric I hadn’t brought to the table” – and soon after leaving Vogue she became a designer officially. Two former designers with whom she had collaborated at Marni, Molly Molloy and Kristin Forss, approached her with an idea for a new label. Colville, in which the three share creative and business responsibility, launched earlier this year, making the kind of colourful, textured, timelessly esoteric pieces that transformed Marni from an obscure fur house into a cult label.“I am not sure I would ever have left Vogue if what happened hadn’t happened. Now that I’ve got the distance of a year, I can see how a situation that was a bit messy propelled me from a job I loved into something much more exciting. Three women starting a company together as a kind of collective – it feels very right, very much of our time.” In addition to Colville, a second project – a new digital platform – is in the pipeline.So, a scrape that might have made Chambers fall out of love with fashion renewed her passion for the industry. “When you’ve been in a job for 20 years, you think you’ve identified who the good guys are. But you never know who will be there when you’re not, you know, Lucinda From Vogue. It has been wonderful to find out that, actually, they were all still there.”One of the first people to pick up the phone during the fallout was Anna Wintour, who commissioned Chambers to shoot Pharrell Williams for last December’s cover of American Vogue. Michael Kors – whose T-shirt Chambers had disparaged – offered a very public olive branch by inviting her to his New York fashion week show, where she was given a prime front-row seat. “What was amazing, after the shock, was the support,” she says now. “You don’t assume that it will be there. It was quite overwhelming, actually.”The newest member of Chambers’ household is Tig, a jointed wooden mannequin bought on eBay. Today she is wearing a trench by \u0026amp Other Stories over a zip-up knit by Zara. (As styled by Chambers, I took the look for Celine.) Dressing herself, dressing Tig, dressing her house, “it all comes from the same place,” she says. “I do it to give myself pleasure, and what gives me pleasure is fabric and colour and texture and pattern.” Ideas can come from anywhere. Today, she’s ruminating over rolls of yellow, blue and red electrical tape that she spotted on a shelf in the post office. “Those colours… I know they will turn up in something I do, although I don’t know yet what form it will be. I don’t think I’m a particularly original person. I get my ideas from the world around me. You have to be on receive mode all the time, that’s the thing. And if you like something, if it makes you happy, then you go for it.”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7429f6118f077bbcffe4cd0cd5fd303da44cf914/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d31299b0b37611080ad8ec497b65897","title":"gemma arterton keira knightley feminists dont wear pink","story":"Arterton reimagines her Bond girl role for the #MeToo era, while Knightly writes frankly about the experience of motherhood Knightley, whose daughter was born in 2015, is about to release Colette, in which she stars as the eponymous French writer, celebrated for her taboo-breaking literary work. It is her first lead role for some time, having scaled back her acting work after giving birth.Now 33, Knightley made her name with a string of period films, including Pride \u0026amp Prejudice and Atonement, and popular hits such as Bend It Like Beckham and the Pirates of the Caribbean series.Her essay, titled The Weaker Sex, begins by describing her daughter’s birth: “My vagina split. You came out with your eyes open. Arms up in the air. Screaming.” She continues: “I remember the shit, the vomit, the blood, the stitches.”Knightley’s purpose is to criticise the pressures and expectations placed on new mothers. She contrasts her postpartum experience with that of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gave birth to her second child the day after Knightley: “She was out of hospital seven hours later with her face made up and high heels on. The face the world wants to see … Don’t show. Don’t tell. Stand there with your girl and be shot by a pack of male photographers.”Knightley goes on to outline her frustrations with her male colleagues and their hands-off parenting (“They don’t see their children. They’re working. They need to concentrate”) before stating: “I am not the weaker sex.” After outlining her resentment at male treatment – “I like them. But I don’t want to flirt and mother them” – she concludes: “Male ego. Stop getting in the way.”Arterton’s contribution is a short story reimagining Strawberry Fields, the character she played in the James Bond movie Quantum of Solace. In the film, Fields is an MI6 agent who succumbs to Bond’s charms, despite being assigned to force him to return from the field, and she is eventually murdered on the orders of villain Dominic Greene.Released in 2008, Quantum of Solace was one of Arterton’s earliest significant roles, before solidifying her status with the well-regarded The Disappearance of Alice Creed and Tamara Drewe. She recently starred in The Escape, about a mother who walks out on her family, and will be seen shortly as Vita Sackville-West in Vita and Virginia, about Sackville-West’s relationship with writer Virginia Woolf.Entitled Woke Woman, Arterton’s story describes Fields’ encounter with Bond in a Bolivian airport: “I meet Mr Bond at the baggage reclaim. He eyes me up, giving me the once over. I introduce myself. He makes some smarmy comment. ‘Mr Bond,’ I say, ‘I’m not interested in flirting with you. I am here to work.’” Unlike in the film, Fields refuses an invitation to Bond’s hotel room: “Maybe he is attractive, but he’s at least 20 years older than me, we’ve only just met, he’s a work colleague – the list goes on. Plus this man has a reputation. Don’t women who go up to his hotel room and sleep with him usually die in some horrific yet iconic way?”Fields leaves, as she says, “unharmed”, before taking out a car full of would-be hijackers. She adds: “Thank God I wore flats. Although a stiletto heel might’ve come in handy …”Arterton added that she appreciated the camaraderie of the Time’s Up era, saying: “In my profession, there has has been a culture of competition: there’s one part for a woman, three female directors. We’re all fighting for a position and it shouldn’t be like that.”She also revealed that Netflix gives compulsory harassment training to all cast and crew and prints a helpline number on every daily call sheet.

Bado calls this “bread porridge” – a brownish, flecked mush of fresh breadcrumbs from leftover loaves which have been blitzed into tiny pieces.It is a tasty solution to the shocking daily waste of bread, with more than 24m slices thrown away in Britain every day.On Thursday the first 100 loaves of so-called ‘Waste Bread’ – baked in the early hours – will go on sale in 10 selected branches of Gail’s Bakery, before being rolled out across the rest of its 43-strong chain in London and the south-east. Roughly one-third of each baked 750g loaf consists of leftover bread and the chain calculates that the 100 loaves being baked daily will save approximately 10kg of bread being wasted per day.“We’re calling it Waste Bread which some people think might sound a bit odd but we think this is being honest and clear with our customers” says Roy Levy, Gail’s head baker and head of development. “It’s re-using leftover but edible bread from our own supply chain which means we know exactly what is in it and where it has come from.”The original idea was Bado’s, following a discussion with her flatmate about food waste and how edible bread could be re-used in a new product.“Here’s one I prepared earlier” she quips, cutting into a warm loaf straight from the oven, and pointing out its “tacky, textured crumb” sitting beneath a thick crust. “It’s taken me about nine months to perfect this recipe, with lots of trials, and I do think of it as my baby” she explains. “The beauty is that because every day’s leftovers are different, every loaf has its own slightly different taste.”The chain will only use fresh surplus bread (any kind, not just sourdough) from its own shops and while it is impossible to predict how much there will be every day, Gail’s bakers make small batches to ensure minimum waste. Every night, its shops donate unused food to more than 40 local charities, but any leftover bread not sold or distributed in this way will now be re-used in the new bread.For weeks Bado has been training the team of bakers at Gail’s wholesale business – The Bread Factory – and which (despite its name) specialises in hand-made, traditional artisan baking using French methods. Its popular and award-winning range includes baguettes (the biggest single seller), focaccia and numerous varieties of sourdough (including best-selling potato and rosemary) and are served in top UK restaurants as well as through its shops.“This is most definitely not a trial but a full production launch,” Levy adds. “We want to see what customer reaction is but we hope it will be very positive.”To entice consumers, the agreed retail price for Gail’s 750g loaf of ‘Waste Bread’ has been reduced from £4.20 to £3.70 for the launch on Thursday. It is a lot for a loaf of bread, but in line with the £3 the bakery charges for a standard 500g sourdough loaf.As the UK battles to reduce its annual £20bn food waste bill – equivalent to more than £300 per UK citizen – bread remains one of the most wasted items at all stages in the supply chain.But in the fresh food supply chain there are different challenges because of strict health and safety rules about dates within which food can be used for human consumption.There have been other successful innovations to use leftover bread that would otherwise go to waste, particularly in beer brewing.Toast Ale, for example, was launched two years ago by Tristram Stuart, the founder of the food waste charity Feedback, who was inspired to use leftover bread to make beer by a Belgian brewer who follows the same process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deb13a2919f437fb447ddf17de569b5d5d7d1a88/0_0_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0916610eeeac453b5abe9b3cf0477abd","title":"the fiver liverpool manchester city","story":"Sign up now!

Sign up now!While last weekend’s Sky Sports Super Sunday was rather a damp squib featuring Cardiff City and Burnley, the absence of braying American losers and the supporters who convene to cheer them on as they play golf across the network means the channel have been forced to up their game and put on a comparative fireworks display this time around. While Chelsea and Arsenal are expected to swat Southampton and Fulham aside on the undercard, the outcome of their games will be quickly forgotten, drowned out by the crescendo of hype surrounding the main event. A clash in which defending champions and title favourites Manchester City take on a Liverpool side who many people think might be in with a shout of preventing their rivals from winning the league by more than 10 points.In All Or Nothing, the hard-hitting documentary created by Manchester City’s propaganda wing that is available on Amazon Prime, Pep Guardiola stated that Liverpool’s front three players “scare me” and he has every right to be afraid of a team managed by perhaps the only manager in world football that has his measure. Jürgen Klopp is one of very few peers who has won more often than he has lost against Guardiola, not that it made a huge difference in the last campaign when his team contrived to collect nine points out of 18 against teams that ended up being relegated. As the early signs this season suggest such carelessness has finally been eliminated, Sunday’s match, while still very early in the season, takes on added significance.In a bid to ensure there is no repeat of the ugly scenes that marred City’s last visit to Anfield, a huge amount of the pre-match publicity has been devoted to the ugly scenes that marred City’s last visit to Anfield. On that occasion, in Big Cup, a Liverpool “welcome committee” pelted the team coach with beer bottles, flares and other missiles, shattering one window and causing thousands of pounds’ worth of damage. With not a single arrest made in the subsequent police investigation and City losing the game, the incentive for a repeat performance seems quite high.However, in a turn of events that wouldn’t look out of a place in a pacy primetime BBC drama written by Jed Mercurio, City have stopped just short of announcing they’ll be employing several decoy buses, but say they won’t be revealing which route they’ll be taking. As a further precaution, they will also be equipping their conveyance with what are breathlessly being reported across assorted media outlets as “spy cameras”. Able to swivel, zoom in and out, and even take pictures, these modern-day surveillance devices are more commonly known as … “cameras”.

Modern professionals are supposed to need a sleep after training. Wenger’s usually did not.It is a different story now. Under Unai Emery the players know they have worked, and they certainly sleep. It is one example of the shifting sands at the club but, when the broader picture is laid out, it adds up to revolution.“We’ve started from scratch, basically, with the new manager,” the goalkeeper Petr Cech says. “It feels like a new club,” the full-back Héctor Bellerín believes. A widespread view has taken root. The only things left standing from the Wenger era are the walls.Emery is not the most obvious revolutionary but his methods and character contrast so sharply with those of Wenger that he appears like one. In terms of training, match preparation, communication, mentality and the approach to player development and care, everything is different.What’s more, there is a good feeling in the dressing room. Everybody knows what would have happened if the team had lost back-to-back fixtures at the start of the season under Wenger. But when they did under Emery – against Manchester City and Chelsea – there was no panic.Equally, after eight subsequent wins on the spin in all competitions and going into Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, there has been no rush to acclaim Emery as the best thing ever. The mood is balanced, quietly optimistic. Perhaps there has been a reaction to the wild emotions of the final part of Wenger’s tenure.People do not know what to make of Emery and by saying nothing at his press conferences he has given them no chance to pass any judgment on his personality. The Spaniard remains under wraps and it feels entirely calculated. People are trying to work him out. Emery, meanwhile, is just working.It is what he does and has always done since his first job at Llorca in Spain’s second ision B in 2004-05. “I’m not the kind of coach who says: ‘Let’s do a few piggy-in-the-middle exercises and go home for lunch,’” Emery once said.“I was a second ision B player and I’ve had to work very hard. I tell the players: ‘The moment we stop working hard on this, as soon as we stop dedicating hours to this, we’ll fall.’”It is not only what Emery does in training at Arsenal but when and where. He is obsessed by the small details and he will train on the day before a game at the same time as the kick-off, or as close to it as possible if it is an evening fixture. Before home league matches, he has looked to train the day beforehand at the Emirates Stadium.Emery’s sessions are far more tactical than those of Wenger and he has tried to instil his pressing system together with bespoke patterns of play. His idea is that the players should be able to close their eyes and know where options A, B and C are, before choosing the most progressive one. He wants to “generate superiority” – in other words, have a man over in certain areas of the pitch – and he likes players who can play in more than one position.Emery’s Arsenal will never play long they will always build from the back and although his structures are not rigid, there is structure all the same. Can floating players fit in, such as Aaron Ramsey? The club’s decision to withdraw their offer of a new contract to the attacking midfielder advertises the answer.Wenger’s priority was for his players to have the emotional freedom to express themselves and the common criticism of him was that he would pay zero attention to the opposition.It was all about what his team would do: playing the Arsenal way, which was essentially the only way. Wenger would always be convinced that this would work, and when it did not there was genuine bemusement.Emery is more flexible and a mark of his early weeks has been his ability to turn the tide of games going against his team. The 2-0 home win over Everton two weeks ago was a prime example. Arsenal did not connect in the first half – they are still coming to terms with Emery’s demands – and they needed a string of saves from Cech to keep them at 0-0.But Emery made adjustments at half-time and they worked. “We were better positioned on the pitch for attacking moments and we helped each other more,” he said. The obvious criticism is why can Emery not get it right at the outset, but these are glass half-full times. Emery’s reading of games is one of his strengths. Ten of Arsenal’s 14 league goals have come in the second half of matches.Emery’s preparations are meticulous. They are tailored to each opponent, with the use of video analysis key, and they begin with an hour-long debrief from the previous game. On a big screen, every mistake is pinpointed, along with the good bits. Players are encouraged to see why a particular option is best – ‘If this pass is played, it will open up here and here this teammate has been told to stand there for you.’Post-match, players will get statistical breakdowns on their performances and before the next one, in addition to the hour-long group video session, they can receive one-on-one briefings and information on their direct opponents.At his previous clubs, Emery edited the clips himself. “For every game we play, I might have spent 12 hours working on the video alone,” he said in 2015, when at Sevilla. “In an hour, the players have to understand everything you have seen in 12 hours.”The Spanish winger Joaquín played under Emery at Valencia. “He put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn,” Joaquín said. “He’s obsessed by football. It’s practically an illness.”Emery has demanded that the squad have lunch together and he has made it plain that his door is always open. “Clarity” is a buzzword. The club take regular blood tests from the players and they have been keen, for example, to explain the results in detail to them.It is the results on the field that matter the most, though. Emery is building momentum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceafd93b7cbe0368360e4fcbbb53384fadeb9d99/0_96_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe05f7a55bbc224c7e842b047881db90","title":"brighton v west ham premier league live","story":"West Ham are unchanged from the side who beat Manchester United so convincingly.

In the lounge his seven-year-old granddaughter was watching cartoons. She was so close to the screen that the 7.5-magnitude quake caused the television set crash down on her head.“I told my wife to grab her and run first, and that I would stay and help my cousin,” said Amirullah, recounting the disasters that hit Palu, on Sulawesi island in Indonesia, last Friday. His cousin, 70, who was experiencing an episode of gout, needed his help.As the ground continued to shake they managed to reach the car, but it would not start. That was went the first tsunami struck, sending them up the street in a powerful whoosh and then back toward the house as the water receded into the next massive wave.Amirullah, tall and fit, grabbed hold of his roof on the slide back and yanked himself and his cousin up on to the tiles.Maruni, his wife, had jumped in the car of a fleeing stranger, while his 12-year-old nephew, Riswan, who had been praying at Arqam mosque, survived by clinging on to a coconut tree.Each personal experience would be shared two days later when the family was reunited, but while on the roof Amirullah thought he would never see them again.He chose the roof because he thought that if he died it would be easier for his wife to find him, rather than “washed up by a tsunami God knows where”.From there he had a clear view over the sea, to the left the Donggala regency and to the right, Talise beach in Palu. He stood in horror and awe as tsunamis from each side met in the middle, and twice more smashed down.The first of three waves was clear, but the second and most powerful one was muddy. Amirullah estimates that wave reached six metres in height Indonesia’s disaster agency said it could have been traveling at 250mph (400kmh).When movement in the Palu Koro fault caused last Friday’s strong quake, there was no official warning on the ground that a tsunami could follow. Straddling multiple tectonic plates, earthquakes are common in Indonesia. But residents in Palu say they are shocked a tsunami hit their bay, first smashing first into Donggala on the western tip and then barrelling into Palu’s usually calm waters.“I never believed there could be a tsunami here. Palu is on a bay, not open sea,” says Maruni, as she shakes her head and fights back tears.The 50-year-old was returning to her house for the first time on Friday morning, a week after the quake and tsumani flatten parts of the coast, killing more than 1,571 people. Less than a mile from her home the Ponulele Bridge lies semi-submerged left and right the view is one of devastation.“It’s just crazy. Crazy,” says Maruni, as she searches through the rubble of her home for important documents – land titles, school certificates, family photos.Driving along the coastline the seemingly fickle nature of the wave is striking, swaths are flattened, while some buildings stand untouched.Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the disaster agency spokesman, said high-resolution satellite data showed how Palu’s topography dictated how far the tsunami penetrated the land.When the wave met rivers, he said, it reached a mile and a half inland. In other areas, blocked by hills, it only reached as far as 2,000ft.But everywhere you go in Palu there are stories of loss and survival, each with their own set of dramatic and strange details.In the village of Loli Dongo on Donggala’s coast, Suriyani was knocked to the floor by the earthquake while she was praying. She ran up the hill behind her when she saw the sea was bubbling, and then watched as the tsunami hit her house below. Descending in the morning, she noticed the trail of beached tropical fish on top the rubble.On Talise beach, the annual Palu Nomoni cultural festival was meant to be in full swing last Friday night.In an attempt to explain the incomprehensible destruction, some have blamed the traditional animist rituals, such as throwing a live goat and flowers into the water to appease the sea gods, that residents say were a part of the festival. They believe God is punishing them for erging from Islam, the dominant religion in Indonesia.Last year, the festival was followed by a devastating storm at the time, local Islamic leaders said the event should have been banned. This year, the festival is a marker for unimaginable loss.A week after the disaster, a few angry signs have appeared around a horse statue on Talise beach that and allude to the perceived wrath from above. Scrawled on one in big silver letters is “we reject Satan worshippers”.When the earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit, a group of dancers from the festival were performing, swallowing fire and swirling around to a quick drum beat, said Setyo Wibowo, a nearby shop owner.On Friday, Setyo was still searching for his daughter and daughter in-law who were on the beach for the event. All the dancers, he notes, are also missing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ffd8db3b7d9ea00b1c4e4e3d3fbd97b99f8254/0_0_6496_3897/master/6496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0da0e7d12144f928a4a62c433d07e90","title":"childs belief in magic adult learner coco khan","story":"There is something about that childlike imagining when there is no knowing that I missOne of the train lines that ran through my neighbourhood when I was growing up was known as the Goblin line. The nickname endured, presumably because of the joke it inspired – “The Goblin line: if it runs on time it must be magic!” – though the derivation is much more boring (it’s a contraction: the Gospel Oak to Barking line, therefore GOBlin).In the juniors’ playground it was the subject of much mythologising. There was the tale of “the Goblin”, a shadowy figure patrolling the lines at night, preying on children who had stayed out too late. Others said the line was blessed by ancient cockney goblins and everyone who rode it would receive good luck.For me, travelling on the Goblin line was just another mysterious thing big people did, along with taxes and sitting during parties. Princess Jasmine from Aladdin rode a magic carpet adults rode the Goblin. I remembered those myths this week when stuck on a rush-hour Goblin, sandwiched between one person’s unrepentant chewing and another’s loud sighing. All the magic in life is dead, I thought. I have never been one for the occult, whether that means horoscopes or those teenage spam emails about a curse that can only be lifted by forwarding them on (who knew supernatural spirits were so into raising their internet profile?). But there is something about that childlike sense of wonder, of imagining when there is no knowing, that I miss.Maybe I’m at an awkward age: too old to believe in magic but not yet old enough for the adult’s. By adult magic, I mean those truly wondrous things: creating a child, or summoning superhuman strength when a loved one passes.Or maybe it’s my fault. I have a device near-permanently attached to my hand, so I can conduct a search on every thought that crosses my mind. And I will follow the results with abandon, through Wikipedia pages to podcasts and beyond. I have lost the ability to tolerate not knowing, and to fill that space with dreams, even for a moment. Perhaps it’s me who has sucked all the magic out of life. Then again, while writing this I discovered there is an entire online community dedicated to the Goblin. More than a thousand strangers connected in our hostile, unfriendly capital, by an interest in a train line. So maybe it was magic, after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96f7417e3955fd8d618b69478fdad0ba70ed8a1d/90_99_5319_3191/master/5319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1134339b3ecbd8ccc02e1ccd9c1f8102","title":"lets move to deal kent these streets have tales to tell","story":"It’s as racy, posh, cultured and seedy as Brighton at its bestThe case against I see nothing.

It’s not enough to have the charisma-wattage of Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga – you need the songs as well.An example: the otherwise enjoyable TV series Empire was kept firmly in soap territory by the ersatz swag of its middling, specially penned rap tracks. Or the Hugh Grant-Drew Barrymore romcom Music and Lyrics, whose tunes, while strongly written, were pastiches put to work as cute plot devices rather than songs in their own right.A Star Is Born needs to be more than that. As a serious drama about addiction, and the supernatural, transformative, sometimes erotic power of music, it needs songs that are earnest and instantly classic. Against the odds, it succeeds.The soundtrack moves chronologically through the story, including snatches of dialogue to jog the memory (or generate light spoilers). It begins with Black Eyes, a swaggering rock’n’roll song performed by Cooper’s country rocker Jackson Maine, which ladles up big dollops of The Seeker by the Who with a drizzling of Lynyrd Skynrd and My Morning Jacket. The guitar shredding, meanwhile, is like Neil Young without the ragged edges – unsurprising perhaps given that a major creative force here is Lukas Nelson (son of Willie) whose band Promise of the Real currently back Young. Nelson has numerous co-writng credits across the soundtrack, alongside Gaga, Cooper, Mark Ronson, Jason Isbell and Diane Warren.Cooper makes you sick, really. He delivers a very accomplished lead performance in the film and, as director, crafts scenes of intimate naturalism and big-guns emotion with equal aplomb. His arguably unnecessary shirtlessness in one scene was instantly validated by the audible ripple of arousal around the cinema I saw it in. And to top it all, he can sing: convincingly snarly on blues-rockers like Alibi, stoic on the extremely strong Isbell-penned country ballad Maybe It’s Time, affectingly doleful on his duets with Gaga.His Jackson is an alcoholic who meets Ally, a waitress and jobbing singer who entrances him in a bar with a performance of La Vie en Rose. It’s a nice opening performance from Gaga: the low-key setting hardens any potential ripeness, and perhaps only she could create its balance of genuine melodrama and knowing camp. Ally turns out to be an instinctive songwriter, and briefly knocks Jackson out of his stupor the pair fall in love. Her star is indeed born, but Jackson struggles to stay in her slipstream, buffeted by his drinking, familial pain, tinnitus and perhaps a bit of jealousy.The film’s most powerful sequence sees the two in perfect equilibrium. Jackson invites Ally out at an open-air concert to perform Shallow, the song they worked up together the previous day. Their performance is pure symbiosis, him needing her stability and creative energy, she needing his big stage, and Gaga is extraordinarily good. Moments before she makes the octave jump for the big chorus, her face flickers with terror, then as she is singing it, disbelief – a moment that announces music is bigger than its performers, that it plays them rather than the other way round. The song itself is torrid yet robust, and truly outstanding.As her solo career takes off, Ally segues from Jackson’s earthy songcraft towards poppier territory, via another highlight: Look What I Found, a joyous bit of Aloe Blacc-style neo-Stax soul that suits Gaga incredibly well. It was at this point of the film, with Jackson voicing scepticism towards her glossy new sound, that I pre-emptively cringed. It looked like we were heading for a retread of La La Land, where pop is snootily compared with the “real”, “authentic” stuff played on wooden instruments without choreography. But this is where the casting of Gaga delivers an extra level of legitimacy. The commitment and skill she brings to these performances shows that pop is just as worthy, and allows Ally to exacerbate Jackson’s creative frustration even if she doesn’t mean to. When she berates Jackson for his condescension, it is a moment of bracing anti-snobbery.Nevertheless, it needs that authority from Gaga to lift some slightly underwritten material in this section, as she shows off another lesser-heard side of her real-life work: the R\u0026ampB minimalist. Heal Me has lovely, dreamy verses, but Hair Body Face is a definite third single, and the opening to Why Did You Do That? is perhaps a bit heavy-handed: “Why do you look so good in those jeans?  Why do you come around me with an ass like that?” is a motorway-legal signpost to point out the increasing creative differences between the central pair.The piano ballads, though, are truly blue-chip. I Don’t Know What Love Is is a beautiful duet, Cooper giving a modest extra grain to Gaga’s vibrato, and it is followed by Is That Alright?, whose earnestness is again completely sold by Gaga. “I want you to look right in my eyes  to tell me you love me  to be by my side  I want you at the end of my life  I want to see your face  When I fall with grace  At the moment I die” – on the page it is almost ludicrous, but on record it grabs your ribcage. Your least ironic friends will choose this as their wedding dance music, and it’ll work. These songs feel like they’ve been in the songbooks of Elton John or Adele for years, and they enable A Star Is Born to succeed in that task of making us believe in these megastars.The soundtrack, like the film, ends with a song whose title I don’t even want to print lest it give a sense of the ending. But suffice to say it is another hyper-emotional piano ballad, where Gaga channels Whitney for the verses but does something much more affectingly girlish and vulnerable with the high-pitched chorus.Cooper sketches out his rockstar in admirably fine lines: boozy, bluesy and with a tot of self-loathing that all comes through in his singing. But it is Gaga who is the true star: a woman capable of every kind of pop, who shows how it can all throw your life into the sharpest relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/649b5cf305a8808438705d5a5be525078aa0e326/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a95443b9d7002a8603e192deb7267488","title":"the finance curse how the outsized power of the city of london makes britain poorer","story":"The financial sector is hailed as the crowning glory of the UK economy. But as it blooms, everything else withers. By  Nicholas ShaxsonIn the 1990s, I was a correspondent for Reuters and the Financial Times in Angola, a country rich with oil and diamonds that was being torn apart by a murderous civil war. Every western visitor asked me a version of the same question: how could the citizens of a country with vast mineral wealth be so shockingly destitute?One answer was corruption: a lobster-eating, champagne-drinking elite was getting very rich in the capital while their impoverished compatriots slaughtered each other out in the dusty provinces. Another answer was that the oil and diamond industries were financing the war. But neither of these facts told the whole story.There was something else going on. Around this same time, economists were beginning to put together a new theory about what was troubling countries like Angola. They called it the resource curse.Academics had worked out that many countries with abundant natural resources seemed to suffer from slower economic growth, more corruption, more conflict, more authoritarian politics and more poverty than their peers with fewer resources. (Some mineral-rich countries, including Norway, admittedly seem to have escaped the curse.) Crucially, this poor performance wasn’t only because powerful crooks stole the money and stashed it offshore, though that was also true. The startling idea was that all this money flowing from natural resources could make their people even worse off than if the riches had never been discovered. More money can make you poorer: that is why the resource curse is also sometimes known as the Paradox of Poverty from Plenty.Back in the 1990s, John Christensen was the official economic adviser to the British tax haven of Jersey. While I was writing about the resource curse in Angola, he was reading about it, and noticing more and more parallels with what he was seeing in Jersey. A massive financial sector on the tiny island was making a visible minority filthy rich, while many Jerseyfolk were suffering extreme hardship. But he could see an even more powerful parallel: the same thing was happening in Britain. Christensen left Jersey and helped set up the Tax Justice Network, an organisation that fights against tax havens. In 2007, he contacted me, and we began to study what we called the finance curse.It may seem bizarre to compare wartorn Angola with contemporary Britain, but it turned out that the finance curse had more parallels with the resource curse than we had first imagined. For one thing, in both cases the dominant sector sucks the best-educated people out of other economic sectors, government, civil society and the media, and into high-salaried oil or finance jobs. “Finance literally bids rocket scientists away from the satellite industry,” in the words of a landmark academic study of how finance can damage growth. “People who might have become scientists, who in another age dreamt of curing cancer or flying people to Mars, today dream of becoming hedge-fund managers.”In Angola, the cascading inflows of oil wealth raised the local price levels of goods and services, from housing to haircuts. This high-price environment caused another wave of destruction to local industry and agriculture, which found it ever harder to compete with imported goods. Likewise, inflows of money into the City of London (and money created in the City of London) have had a similar effect on house prices and on local price levels, making it harder for British exporters to compete with foreign competitors.Oil booms and busts also had a disastrous effect in Angola. Cranes would festoon the Luanda skyline in good times, then would leave a residue of half-finished concrete hulks when the bust came. Massive borrowing in the good times and a buildup of debt arrears in the bad times magnified the problem. In Britain’s case, the booms and busts of finance are differently timed and mostly caused by different things. But just as with oil booms, in good times the dominant sector damages alternative economic sectors, but when the bust comes, the destroyed sectors are not easily rebuilt.To argue that the City hurts Britain’s economy might seem crazy. But research increasingly shows that all the money swirling around our oversized financial sector may actually be making us collectively poorer. As Britain’s economy has steadily become re-engineered towards serving finance, other parts of the economy have struggled to survive in its shadow, like seedlings starved of light and water under the canopy of a giant, deep-rooted and invasive tree. Generations of leaders from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair to Theresa May have believed that the City is the goose that lays Britain’s golden eggs, to be prioritised, pampered and protected. But the finance curse analysis shows an oversized City to be a different bird: a cuckoo in the nest, crowding out other sectors.We all need finance. We need it to pay our bills, to help us save for retirement, to redirect our savings to businesses so they can invest, to insure us against unforeseen calamities, and also sometimes for speculators to sniff out new investment opportunities in our economy. We need finance – but this tells us nothing about how big our financial centre should be or what roles it should serve.A growing body of economic research confirms that once a financial sector grows above an optimal size and beyond its useful roles, it begins to harm the country that hosts it. The most obvious source of damage comes in the form of financial crises – including the one we are still recovering from a decade after the fact. But the problem is in fact older, and bigger. Long ago, our oversized financial sector began turning away from supporting the creation of wealth, and towards extracting it from other parts of the economy. To achieve this, it shapes laws, rules, thinktanks and even our culture so that they support it. The outcomes include lower economic growth, steeper inequality, distorted markets, spreading crime, deeper corruption, the hollowing-out of alternative economic sectors and more.Newly published research makes a first attempt to assess the scale of the damage to Britain. According to a new paper by Andrew Baker of the University of Sheffield, Gerald Epstein of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Juan Montecino of Columbia University, an oversized City of London has inflicted a cumulative £4.5tn hit on the British economy from 1995-2015. That is worth around two-and-a-half years’ economic output, or £170,000 per British household. The City’s claims of jobs and tax benefits are washed away by much, much bigger harms.This £2.7tn is added to the £1.8tn, checking carefully for overlap or double-counting, to make £4.5tn. This is a first rough approximation for how much additional GDP Britons might have enjoyed if the City had been smaller, and serving its traditional useful roles. (A third, £700bn category of “excess profits” and “excess remuneration” accruing to financial players has been excluded, to be conservative.)From the 1970s onwards, finance broke decisively free of these controls, taxes were slashed and swathes of our economies were privatised. And our businesses began to undergo a dramatic transformation: their core purposes were whittled down, through ideological shifts and changes in laws and rules, to little more than a single-minded focus on maximising the wealth of shareholders, the owners of those companies. Managers often found that the best way to maximise the owners’ wealth was not to make better widgets and sprockets or to find new cures for malaria, but to indulge in the sugar rush of financial engineering, to tease out more profits from businesses that are already doing well. Social purpose be damned. As all this happened, inequality rose, financial crises became more common and economic growth fell, as managers started focusing their attentions in all the wrong places. This was misallocation, again, but the more precise term for this transformation of business and the rise of finance is “financialisation”.The best-known definition of the term comes from the American economist Gerald Epstein, a co-author of the new study cited above: financialisation is “the increasing role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and international economies”. In other words, it is not just that financial institutions and credit have puffed up spectacularly in size since the 1970s, but also that more normal companies such as beermakers, media groups or online rail ticket services, are being “financialised”, to extract maximum wealth for their owners.Take private equity firms, for instance. They typically buy up a solid company then financially engineer that company to squeeze all its different stakeholders, one by one. They run the company’s financial operations through tax havens, fleecing taxpayers. They may squeeze workers’ pay and pensions pots, or delay paying suppliers. They might buy up several companies to dominate a market niche, then milk customers for monopoly profits. They chisel the pension funds that invest alongside them, with hidden fees. And so on.Or, consider the financial structure of Trainline, the online rail ticket seller. When you buy a ticket, you may pay a small booking fee, perhaps 75p. After leaving your bank account, that 75p takes an extraordinary financial journey. It starts with London-based Trainline Limited, then flows up to another company that owns the first, called Trainline Holdings Limited. That company is owned by another, which is owned by another and so on.Five companies up and your brave little 75p skips off to the tax haven of Jersey, then back again to London, where it passes through five more companies, then back to Jersey, then over to Luxembourg, another tax haven. Higher up still, it passes through three or more impenetrable companies in the Cayman Islands, then joins a multitude of other rivulets and streams entering the US, where, 20 or so companies after starting, it flows to KKR, a giant US investment firm.It flows onwards, to KKR’s shareholders, including banks, investment funds and billionaires. KKR owns or part-owns more than 180 real, solid companies including the car-sharing firm Lyft, Sonos audio systems and Trainline. But on top of those 180 real firms, KKR has at least 4,000 corporate entities, including more than 800 in the Cayman Islands, links in snaking chains of entities with peculiar names drawn from finance’s arcane lingo, like (in Trainline’s case) Trainline Junior Mezz Limited or Victoria Investments Intermediate Holdco Limited.This is an invisible financial superstructure, siphoning wealth from Trainline’s genuinely useful and profitable services, upwards, away and offshore. None of this is remotely illegal. In our age of financialisation, this is increasingly how business is done.In 2012, Boris Johnson, then the mayor of London, stood under an umbrella by a busy road, his blond hair whiffling in the wind. “A pound spent in Croydon is far more of value to the country from a strict utilitarian calculus than a pound spent in Strathclyde,” he gushed. “Indeed you will generate jobs and growth in Strathclyde far more effectively if you invest in Hackney or Croydon or in other parts of London.”We are back to the idea of London as the engine of the economy. Is he right? Will pampering Croydon, London and south-east England generate wealth that can then be spread out to “Strathclyde”, Scotland and the regions? Or is London the centre of a financialising machine that sucks power and money away from the peripheries? Can an oversized City of London and the rest of Britain prosper alongside each other? Or, for the regions to prosper, must the City of London be humbled? This is perhaps the defining economic question of our times. It is a question ultimately bigger than Brexit.The newly published research provides part of the answer it suggests that the power of London finance is hurting Britain, to the tune of £4.5tn.But let’s take a more fine-grained look. If Johnson thinks money flows from Croydon to “Strathclyde” (a Scottish administrative region, now abolished) he may wish to ponder the Strathclyde Police Training and Recruitment Centre, built by the construction firm Balfour Beatty and opened in 2002 under the now-notorious private finance initiative. Under PFI, instead of the government building and paying for projects such as schools or hospitals directly, they get private firms to borrow the money in the City to finance their construction, under a deal that the government will pay them back over, say, 25 years, with interest and extra goodies. (Cynics see PFI as an expensive way for successive governments to hide their borrowing and spending, by outsourcing it all to the private sector.)The training centre (now called simply the Police Scotland Training Centre) sits underneath a corporate latticework nearly as complex as Trainline’s. PFI payments flow from the government to a private special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Strathclyde Limited Partnership then flow upwards from it through 10 or so companies or partnerships, to a £2bn Guernsey-based firm called International Public Partnerships Limited (INPP), then onwards via tangled shareholdings, partnerships, banking and lending arrangements, and lawyers and accountants clipping fees along the way, to other people and firms in London, South Africa, New York, Texas, Jersey, Munich, Ontario and more. The pipework is complex but the overall pattern is clear. Money flows from police budgets in Scotland, up through these financialised pipelines and into the City, posh parts of London and the south-east and offshore. Along the way, profits are being made and distributed and tax is avoided.But there is a bigger issue than tax here. Treasury data shows that while the police training centre cost £17-18m to build, the flow of payments to the PFI consortium will add up to £112m from 2001 to 2026, well over six times as much, and vastly more than what the government would have spent if it had simply borrowed that much itself and paid Balfour Beatty directly to build it. This fits a wider pattern. The 700-odd PFI schemes in Britain had an estimated capital value of less than £59.1bn in 2017, yet taxpayers will end up paying out more than £308bn for them, well over five times that sum. PFI is a gift to the City which has resulted in, as the PFI expert Allyson Pollock acidly put it, “one hospital for the price of two”.I have looked at several PFI corporate structures: each has a similarly convoluted financial architecture, and each involves a rain of payments from British regions (including poorer parts of London) into this central-London-focused financial nexus, overseas and offshore. And PFI is just one component of a larger picture. About £240bn, a third of the UK government’s annual budget, now goes on privately run but taxpayer-funded public services, most of it run through similarly financialised, London-focused pipelines.On this evidence, Johnson’s picture of money flowing from Croydon to Strathclyde has it exactly back to front. These are examples of what the late geographer Doreen Massey called the “colonial relationship” between parts of London and the rest of the country. To visualise what is going on, I like to imagine old white men in top hats manipulating a Heath-Robinson-like contraption of spindly pipework perched on top of the economy, vacuuming up coins and notes and IOUs from the pockets of those underneath: the workers and users of private care homes, sexual abuse referral centres, schools, hospitals, prisons – and, of course, those of us paying mortgages on expensive homes. All are unconsciously paying tribute into this great invisible extractive machinery.It is true, of course, that a chunk of the City’s money comes from overseas, so is not extracted from Britain. That at least must be a net benefit, surely? Not so. The core value of finance to our economy comes not from the jobs and billionaires it creates, but from the services it provides. Bringing in enormous quantities of overseas wealth doesn’t provide useful services for the British economy – but it does increase the power and wealth of the finance sector, contributing to the brain drain, the economic crises, the crashing productivity, the predatory attitudes, the misdirected lending and the subsequent inequality. Our open arms to the world’s dirty money is corrupting our politics, and it is puffing up our housing markets, penalising the young, the poor and the weak. It is all deepening the finance curse.Finance is a great geographical sorting machine, iding us into offshore winners and onshore losers. But it is also a sorting machine for race, gender, disability and vulnerability – taking value from those suffering reduced public services or wage cuts, and from groups made up disproportionately of women, non-white people, the elderly and the vulnerable – and delivering it to the City. It is a generational sorting machine too, as PFI, risky shadow banking profits and financialised games help the winners to jam today, with the bills sent to our kids.This hidden tide of money flows constantly from the tired, the weak, the vulnerable huddled masses across Britain, up through these invisible filigree pipelines to a relatively small number of white European or North American men in Mayfair, Chelsea, Jersey, Geneva, the Caymans or New York. This is the finance curse in action. And it’s nice work if you can get it.Why can’t we do something about the overwhelming power of finance? Why are the protests so muted? Why can’t we tax, regulate or police City institutions properly?We can’t, and we don’t, not just because the City’s money talks so loudly, but also because of an ideology that has bamboozled us into thinking that we must be “competitive”. The City is going head to head with other financial centres around the world, they cry, and if we are to stay ahead in this race, we cannot hold it back with tough regulations, clod-hopping police snooping around, or “uncompetitive” tax rates. Otherwise, all that money will whoosh off to Geneva or Hong Kong. After Brexit, it will be even more urgent to stay competitive.“We must be competitive” – it sounds great, right? Tony Blair embraced this concept, even before he slammed the Financial Services Authority in 2005, saying it was seen as “hugely inhibiting of efficient business by perfectly respectable companies that have never defrauded anyone”. David Cameron bowed down to this competitiveness agenda when he declared that “We are in a global race today... Sink or swim. Do or decline.” Theresa May reiterated the idea last month when she declared that Britain would be “unequivocally pro-business” with the lowest corporate tax rate among G20 countries.Many people in Britain, it is true, are ambivalent about all this. They rightly fret that the City is a global money-laundering paradise, harming other nations, but (whisper it quietly) they like the hot money and oligarchs it attracts to our shores. There is a trade-off, they think, between doing the right thing and preserving our prosperity. Some do understand that if other countries follow suit with this competitiveness agenda, a race to the bottom ensues, leading to ever-lower corporate taxes, laxer financial regulation, greater secrecy, looser controls on financial crime and so on. The only answer to a race to the bottom, they gloomily conclude, is to agree some sort of multilateral armistice to get countries to co-operate and collaborate in not doing this stuff. But that is like herding squirrels on a trampoline: each country wants to out-compete the others, so there will be cheating on any deal. And it is hard to mobilise voters on this complex, distant global stuff. So, they sigh, we are stuck in this ugly race to the bottom.But there is some tremendous good news here: these people are all flat wrong. The competitiveness agenda, driving us into this race, is intellectual nonsense resting on elementary fallacies, lazy assumptions and confusions. And this is for a few simple reasons. For one thing, economies, tax systems and cities are nothing like companies, and don’t compete like we might think. To get a taste of this, ponder the difference between a failed company, such as Carillion, and a failed state, such as Syria. Even more to the point, the finance curse shows us that if too much finance harms your economy, then pursuing more finance through the competitiveness agenda will make things worse.Underpinning all this is the fallacy of composition, whereby the fortunes of our big businesses and big banks are conflated with the fortunes of our whole economy. Making HSBC or RBS more globally competitive, the thinking goes, will make Britain more competitive. But to the extent that their profits are extracted from other parts of the British economy, their success hurts Britain more than it helps.What could Britain do with that £16bn? We could simultaneously run nine Oxford Universities, double the resources of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, treble government cybersecurity resources, and double staff numbers at HMRC, the tax authorities. Or we could send nearly half a million kids to Eton each year, if you could fit them all in. Does this trade-off somehow make Britain’s tax system, or Britain itself, more competitive? Of course not.Corporate tax cuts are in fact just one of many varieties of goodies that we shower on the mobile financiers and multinationals. The same basic arguments hold in other areas, too. Better financial regulation brings benefits, while also scaring away the wealth-extracting predators. It is a win-win. There is no trade-off.Words such as competitiveness and related terms (such as the even more fatuous UK Plc) are wielded to trick millions of taxpayers into thinking that it is in their own self-interest to hand over goodies – tax cuts, financial deregulation, tolerance for monopolies, turning a blind eye to crime and more – to large multinationals and financial institutions. We are permanently at a tipping point, we are told: all that investment is about to disappear down a gurgling global plughole unless we cut taxes and deregulate, NOW, I tell you.We need investment that is embedded in the local economy, bringing jobs, skills and long-term engagement, where managers send their kids to local schools and the business supports an ecosystem of local supply chains. This is the golden stuff, and if an investment is nicely embedded, a whiff of tax won’t scare it away (even if Brexit might). Any investor who is more sensitive to tax has, almost by definition, shallower roots. So taxes will tend to discourage the flightier, more predatory, more financialised investors, who bring fewer jobs and local linkages, and higher corporate tax revenues pay for ingredients that attract investors: roads, police forces, courts, and the educated and healthy workers. To prosper, Britain should increase its effective corporate tax rates, at least for financiers and large multinationals.Of course, you could also argue that the best way to become more competitive would be for a country to invest in and upgrade education or infrastructure, control dangerous capital flows across borders, manage the exchange rate, or carefully target industrial policies to nurture productive domestic economic ecosystems. You could insist that something called “national competitiveness” must meet the test of productivity, good jobs and a broad-based rise in living standards. There are respectable arguments along all these lines.But these are not the visions that Blair, Cameron, May, Trump and other finance-captured leaders have been pushing. Their competitiveness agenda is about pursuing rootless global capital in a dog-eat-dog world. Give big banks and multinationals the goodies, and look the other way when they behave badly, in the craven and pathetic hope that they won’t run away.Any country engaging in a race to the bottom on this stuff also needs to understand that the race does not stop when tax rates reach zero. There is literally no limit to the extent to which corporate players and the wealthy wish to free-ride off the taxes paid by the rest of us. Eliminate their taxes, appease them, and they will demand other subsidies, like the playground bully. Why wouldn’t they?And yet your local car wash, your barber, or your last surviving neighbourhood fruit-and-veg merchant can’t credibly threaten to jump to Monaco if they don’t like their tax rates or fruit hygiene regulations. The agenda favours the mobile big players with handouts, leaving the domestic small fry to pay the full price of civilisation – plus a surcharge to cover the roaming members of the billionaire classes who won’t. The agenda systematically shifts wealth upwards from poor to rich, distorting our economies, reducing growth and undermining our democracies. It is always harmful.The competitiveness agenda is a billionaire-friendly hoax. Most competent economists know this already. “If we can teach undergraduates to wince when they hear someone talk about competitiveness, we will have done our nation a great service,” the US economist Paul Krugman explained in a 1993 paper. “A government wedded to the ideology of competitiveness,” he later added, “is as unlikely to make good economic policy as a government committed to creationism is to make good science policy.”So the competitiveness agenda is an intellectual house of cards, ready to fall. If we can topple it, we can tackle the finance curse. It is pretty straightforward, in fact. In the 1983 movie War Games, a computer geek hacks into the US Department of Defense’s supercomputer and gets dragged into a game of strategy called Global Thermonuclear War. As the game merges with reality, the machine races through thousands of scenarios before concluding: “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.” Britain is in the same position. By joining this “competitive” global race we have not only been beggaring others – we have been beggaring ourselves, too. We can, and we must, simply step out of the race, unilaterally. That last word, unilaterally, is key. We can just stop it. This is a race for losers.We need not bow down to the demands of monopolists, foreign oligarchs, tax-haven operators, wealth-extracting private equity moguls, too-big-to-jail banks, or PFI milkers. We can tax, regulate and police our financial sector as we ought to. Global coordination and cooperation are worth doing where possible, but we need not wait for it. And by appealing to national self-interest, we can mobilise the biggest constituency of all, and put finance back in its rightful place: serving Britain’s people, not served by them.Adapted from The Finance Curse: How Global Finance Is Making Us All Poorer by Nicholas Shaxson, published by Vintage on 11 October and available from bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ce2c1a7fb18c884db2b90aa7a4b68c61f04f14/0_0_4872_3566/master/4872.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249af432a71521f5e9a1d11aae424311 880w","title":"eu may offer post brexit trade flexibility to help may secure deal","story":"Frictionless trade option likely to be left open in case UK’s red lines change after departureThe EU is preparing to help Theresa May build a parliamentary majority for a Brexit deal by offering Downing Street a written commitment to think again about “frictionless trade” if the UK changes its red lines after it leaves the union.EU leaders want to throw the prime minister a lifeline in their long-awaited political declaration on a future deal, a first draft of which is expected next week.The four to five page declaration is expected to include an “evolution clause” in which the EU will say it remains open to improving its offer should a British government change tack during the 21-month transition period.EU officials hope that, despite the opposition of a large number of Tory and Labour MPs to a Canada-style agreement which would create barriers to trade, May will be able to garner enough support in parliament for a deal if it is clear that the declaration is not the last word on the future relationship.During a recent meeting in Brussels with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, Jeremy Corbyn was told that supporting a Canada-style free trade deal now would not bind the hands of a future Labour government, diplomatic sources have told the .Labour has said it will vote against any free-trade agreement that erects barriers to trade through regulatory and customs checks. The prime minister is likely to need the support of a large number of Labour MPs to get any deal through parliament given the ision within her own party.Barnier has also appealed to MEPs to talk down the possibility of an extension of the two-year negotiating time allowed under article 50 of the EU treaties, in an attempt to pressure parliament into supporting a deal.Earlier this week, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, expressed his opposition to any prolongation of the talks.The EU’s commitment to improve its offer at a later date is being drafted into the EU’s political declaration spelling out the terms of the “Canada +++” offer.The document will say that the EU’s offer of a tariff- and quota-free deal on imports and exports will still involve new customs and regulatory checks because of the UK’s decision to leave the single market and customs union. It will add, however, that “if these positions were to evolve, the union will be prepared to reconsider its offer”.Mujtaba Rahman, a former treasury and European commission official who is now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said the clause reflected the ongoing debate within the EU over how hard it should be on the terms of a deal.Similar language was used in March in guidelines produced by Donald Tusk, the European council president, in a manoeuvre designed to avoid closing off options that could be available in the future.“It seems that the same trick is being used again,” Rahman said. “The idea is to say that a more ambitious future is possible. There is debate about how hard they should be now and whether options should be closed off. This is an acknowledgement that political space could open up for a more ambitious deal later.”Barnier is known for brandishing a picture to illustrate how the UK’s current decisions on the single market and customs restrict the EU’s offer, with descending steps associated with different countries’ levels of access to the EU single market.An EU source said: “The message to Labour is that the UK could move up Barnier’s stairs if the British government changes its position in the transition period. Voting in favour of the deal now would not be the last word on it.”A senior EU official told the  that such a clause “would suit the EU and suit the UK”, by ensuring that neither side was boxed in. A European commission spokesman declined to comment on “ongoing negotiations”. understands that Barnier was encouraged by May’s failure to name-check the Chequers proposals during her party conference speech in Birmingham.The EU has rejected the central planks of the prime minister’s white paper: a common rulebook on goods, and a customs arrangement that would avoid checks on goods while allowing the UK to pursue an independent trade policy.However, the political declaration is also likely to contain a pledge to build a “free trade area” with the UK, to the extent to which the British government’s stance allows, in a nod towards the intention of building a deep and unprecedented trading relationship. An EU diplomat said: “Maybe it is just language, but that’s what is important at this political stage.”Confidence that diplomatic language over trade in the declaration can make it palatable to Downing Street is not yet matched over the issue of avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.The UK committed to agreeing to a “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border, which would be put in place until a future trade deal or technical solution could resolve the problem.The British government has so far proposed a temporary customs arrangement, under which the whole of the UK would in effect stay in the customs union for a restricted period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d330a281464bc150c66bccf02ce796d56c3093/0_123_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cab680162ea05fe0a68c10e7b9bfa5e3","title":"greens set target of overtaking lib dems englands third party fracking party conference","story":"Co-leaders say direct protests against fracking and enforced immigrations will continueThe Greens have begun their annual conference by setting a target to become England’s third-biggest party while promising to maintain direct protests against policies such as fracking and support others who do.A month after taking over as co-leaders, Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley unveiled what they called a transformative programme, including measures to redirect economic policy away from growth towards general wellbeing.As well as a proposal to replace GDP as a yardstick of economic health, with a gauge of how much leisure time people are able to enjoy, announced before the speech, Bartley suggested the Department for Work and Pensions should be renamed the Office for Welfare and Wellbeing, with the Home Office becoming the Department for Security and Welcome.Berry, a London assembly member, began by saying: “To the Lib Dems: we are ready to take your place as England’s third party.”The Greens are fourth by number of councillors, but have only one MP, Caroline Lucas, and still trail behind Ukip as well as the Lib Dems in the opinion polls.In a rapturously received speech in which Berry and Bartley delivered alternate passages, Bartley, who is leader of the opposition on Lambeth council in south London, praised the actions of direct campaigners opposing fracking and enforced immigration removals, warning that police and court action against such people was hugely disproportionate.Bartley hailed three activists jailed for up to 16 months for opposing fracking in Lancashire as being “on the right side of history”. The trio announced on Friday they will appeal amid growing anger about the severity of the sentences.He also called on prosecutors to drop terrorism charges against 15 activists who locked themselves together around an immigration removal charter flight to prevent its departure from Stansted.“The Stansted 15 acted as our conscience,” he said. “The conscience of every person in the country who believes that Britain is better than to shackle people and deport them into danger.”He condemned “the hypocrisy of those who celebrate the suffragettes and the anti-apartheid activists in one breath but then turn their backs on those who fight for human rights today”.In a section on Green policies intended to respond to expected changes to employment amid rapid technological advances, Berry said employees should be guaranteed the right to paid training.“All workers should be able to grow and learn throughout their careers, get trained in the things they need to know for their next job, improve how they do the one they have, or learn a new skill or trade,” she said.One policy idea is to formalise a four-day working week, which has been endorsed by the TUC.Speaking to the  after the speech, Berry said the proposal, as well as one for a universal basic income, was being adopted by others, adding: “As the world changes, our policies become the right solutions.”Bartley said: “The big picture is that we cannot go on as we are. We have to get off this consumption-drive, GDP-worshipping treadmill, which is bad for people and bad for the planet.”The pair said there was no contradiction between them seeking a mainstream role for the Greens and continued support for direct action.The Stansted protesters seemed to be targeted as a warning to others, Bartley said: “The fact they’re invoking terror charges – this is a way of discouraging more action like it.”Berry said: “That kind of radicalism is ready to be in the mainstream – it should be in the mainstream. People are in the mood, nationally, to look for more radical options.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4c29890c2f1b00e1bea4255ffa663f486b1476/0_80_2742_1645/master/2742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f291449c9b3468adfb1eb03c6719ee26","title":"may secretly woos key labour mps to back her brexit deal","story":"Senior Tories press ‘national interest’ case for supporting PM to avoid no-deal outcome Theresa May has drawn up plans for a secret charm offensive aimed at persuading dozens of Labour MPs to back her Brexit deal even if it costs Jeremy Corbyn the chance to be prime minister, the  has learned.Senior Conservatives say they have already been in private contact with a number of Labour MPs over a period of several months, making the case that the national interest in avoiding a no-deal outcome is more important than forcing a general election by defeating the government on May’s Brexit deal.Now, with talks in Brussels entering their frantic final phase, the prime minister and her party whips are stepping up efforts to win backing for a compromise deal that one minister described as a “British blancmange”.They are convinced they will need Labour votes to win, after a fractious Tory conference in Birmingham, at which determined opponents of the prime minister’s approach, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, won plaudits for saying they would vote against it.One Tory source compared the challenge of striking a deal with the EU27 that would satisfy both sides of his own party to “landing a jumbo jet on the penalty spot”.Labour MPs will thus be the focus of intense lobbying, in the period between May returning from Brussels with a Brexit deal and the meaningful vote, which is expected to come about a fortnight later.Conservative whips are rehearsing an argument, the outlines of which were clear in the prime minister’s conference speech, that the deal on offer is a pragmatic one.One cabinet member identified a string of Labour MPs they thought would take a “reasoned approach”, such as Chris Bryant, Rachel Reeves and Lucy Powell, politicians who have been critical of Corbyn in the past.Bryant, a remainer, said he would be prepared to have discussions with the government about a deal in the national interest – but only if May shifted her position towards membership of a customs union. “I could not vote for Chequers at it stands,” he said. Reeves said she had no intention of backing the government.Privately, some Labour MPs believe at least 15 of their colleagues could vote with the government, rather than appear to their constituents to be trying to “block Brexit”, with up to 30, including some frontbenchers, prepared to abstain, rather than go through the voting lobbies with hardliners such as Rees-Mogg.James Cleverly, the Conservative deputy chairman, has been liaising with some in this group.May appealed directly to Labour backbenchers in her conference speech when she spoke of the “heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith”, saying they were on the backbenches, not in the shadow cabinet of what she called the “Jeremy Corbyn party”.She also told the party faithful that her deal “keeps faith with the British people” and was in the national interest. And she pointed to Sajid Javid’s announcement of a tougher migration regime as evidence that her approach delivers on the referendum result by ending the free movement of people.Meanwhile, the EU is preparing to help May build a majority by offering Downing Street a written commitment to think again on “frictionless trade” if the UK changes its red lines after it leaves the bloc.EU leaders want to throw the prime minister a lifeline in the long-awaited political declaration on a future deal, a first draft of which is expected to emerge next week.If she clinches a deal with her EU counterparts in the face of formidable odds, May’s team believe the national mood will shift in her favour.And they hope a positive bounce from the financial markets will help to convince some Labour MPs to hold their noses and back a deal based on Chequers – though she did not use the word Chequers itself in her speech.Senior Conservatives have also been stressing the aspects of May’s approach that Boris Johnson and other hard Brexiters object to – including signing up to EU regulations in key areas.Tory whips are also working on persuading a separate group of MPs from leave-voting constituencies, such as Caroline Flint, from Don Valley, and Gareth Snell, from Stoke-on-Trent Central.Labour’s official policy is to reject any final deal that does not meet six tests drawn up by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, one of which is that it must offer the “exact same benefits” as membership of the single market and customs union.Corbyn said in his conference speech that if the prime minister shifted her position on a customs union, and promised to uphold environmental regulation and workers’ rights, Labour could swing behind her. But his party is keen to secure the opportunity of pushing for a general election by voting down the deal.A Labour source said: “Labour has been clear from the outset that if Theresa May’s Brexit deal does not meet our six tests then we will vote against it in parliament.” He added: “The Tories are wrong to say it’s a choice between Theresa May’s deal or no deal. No deal is simply not a viable option. There is no majority in parliament to take the UK off a cliff in March 2019.”The tight parliamentary arithmetic and the likelihood of a rebellion by the Tory right means that Labour votes will be vital, at least as an insurance policy, while having the additional benefit of encouraging a split within Labour.But Conservative estimates vary as to how many of their own MPs would rebel in such a high-stakes vote. Losing it could unleash a constitutional crisis.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, has suggested as many as 80 Tory rebels could vote against the prime minister, but Tory whips hope to “burn off” the majority, reducing them to around 10 diehards.The government is also expected to argue that, while it will be possible to amend the final motion put before parliament, there is not enough time to delay article 50 and hold a referendum before the Brexit date of 29 March, because both would require primary legislation.However, that has been disputed by second referendum campaigners who say the EU’s 27 member states would be willing to extend article 50 to give time for the UK to legislate for and hold a referendum if it were called for by parliament in the autumn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075080dd8d4e50f8c536f6e478c117d2ac78b0dc/0_103_3444_2066/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6c676726035933b92ea210e3f8193d0","title":"too few children receiving treatment for adhd figures suggest","story":"Exclusive: Findings undermine Ofsted chief inspector’s claim that too many children are being given RitalinChildren in England and especially girls are being under-treated, not over-medicated, for ADHD, new figures obtained by the  suggest.In June, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, Amanda Spielman, claimed too many children were being given Ritalin, the main drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She said reliance on drugs meant behavioural problems were not being addressed.Although studies in children typically show a male preponderance – most commonly about 3 to 1 – it is thought that ADHD is under-recognised in females. In adulthood, the male-female ratio for ADHD “appears to be approximately equal”, according to the Nice guidance, “again raising the possibility that the high gender ratios in childhood may be partly a result of under-identifying the problem in girls, or of a different presentation of symptoms in girls”.This is reflected in the NHSBSA figures: while more males than females are being prescribed ADHD medication in younger age groups, the gap is significantly reduced in older age categories.Spielman’s assertion that too many children were being diagnosed and given drugs for the condition was challenged by the all-party parliamentary group on ADHD. Jo Platt, Labour MP for Leigh who chairs the group, and the Scottish MP Daniel Johnson, who is on medication for ADHD, wrote to Spielman saying they were “very disappointed” with her comments.Spielman replied that, while she recognised ADHD as a medical condition and would not discourage parents from seeking medical help, “there has been a significant rise in the number of children who are on medication for behavioural problems”.In an August statement copied to the , she said: “A number of medical studies have raised the possibility of over-diagnosis. I am concerned that we may sometimes be dealing with the symptoms of bad behaviour without addressing the underlying issues.”The NHSBSA data does not include information on the reason a drug is prescribed, meaning some of the products may have been prescribed for a condition other than ADHD. Since April 2015 the NHSBSA has recorded the number of iniduals receiving prescriptions by counting the NHS numbers captured on prescription forms.Each patient is counted just once regardless of how many different ADHD drugs were prescribed in the cited time period. To avoid double counting across age categories, the patient’s maximum age at the time of prescribing was used in the analysis.The figures provided to the  cover prescriptions dispensed through NHS Prescription Services in England, which come under the British National Formulary section for CNS stimulants and drugs used for ADHD. They exclude those prescribed and dispensed in prisons, hospitals and private prescriptions.“ADHD affects girls just as it affects boys but due to the stigma and common misconception that ADHD is just naughty kids playing up, instead of the neurodevelopmental condition that it is, we know that girls can often slip through the net, struggling in school and in their personal lives without the support they need.“That is why we urgently need intervention to firstly increase the support services offered to both children and adults, but also tackle the stigma around ADHD.“These figures also reinforce the need for the Department for Health and Social Care to begin collecting the number of diagnoses of ADHD. Whilst prescription figures are useful to see the stark gender gap in the treatment of ADHD, the collection of diagnosis statistics will give us a greater understanding of the scale and impact of the condition but also, crucially, highlight areas of best practice and the effectiveness of different treatment methods.”Tony Lloyd, chief executive of the ADHD Foundation, said: “We have known for a long time that ADHD is under-diagnosed and under-medicated in the UK.”ADHD is a recognised mental health condition characterised by hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Lloyd said schools had in the past referred children and particularly boys to doctors because they were challenging in the classroom.“Invariably it was driven by hyperactivity,” he said. “Boys tend to get noticed more.” A decade ago, about four boys were diagnosed for every one girl. Now, with better understanding of how girls are affected, that ratio has come down to about 2.8 boys to every girl.But the numbers of children being prescribed medication that NHS guidance says can help them cope is still low. “I can only put this down to a combination of stigma and under-resourced children’s mental health,” said Lloyd. “Waiting lists are still one to two years in most places for children to get any assessment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3bf0da9bd06112e94f02833346f41aec1995f88/385_147_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffd5419438b9de1bf5100d06350d07ae","title":"sebastian vettel lewis hamilton f1 juggernaut japanese gp","story":"Last season the Japanese Grand Prix played host to the dramatic conclusion of a trilogy of races that left Sebastian Vettel’s title hopes shattered and Ferrari shell-shocked.So strong for so long in the Formula One championship, the German was forced to endure a torturous collapse as Lewis Hamilton took a huge lead at Suzuka. The Mercedes driver sealed the title two races later in Mexico. Now back in Japan, Vettel is once again barely clinging on to his challenge, an experience that will be all the more painful second time around.He had led the title race last year until the 13th round at Monza but he came to Suzuka on the back of a misjudgment in Singapore that caused him to crash and an engine replacement in Malaysia that forced him to start at the back from where he could manage only fourth place. By Japan he was 34 points in arrears. Nothing short of victory was required but an almost unheard of misfortune sealed his fate. A spark plug failure ended his race after four laps, Hamilton won and took an almost unassailable 59-point lead.Vettel’s position is now, if anything, even worse. The pressure is greater and Hamilton is in the form of his life. He holds a 50-point lead, accrued over five wins from the past six races against a stronger Ferrari car. Even now, in his 12th season and with four titles, Hamilton has perhaps surprised himself with his ascent to another level in the mastery of his craft.“I am really happy. When I look back at a lot of these races I couldn’t have hoped for better performances,” he said. “There have been some real dream experiences, races where I would dream of performing at those levels. That’s what I live for.”Vettel took the disappointment last season well. He admitted Ferrari could not keep up with Mercedes in the final third of the title race so knew the odds were against him. Now there is no such comfort. What has made Hamilton’s run so exceptional is that he has achieved it against a driver who had the advantage of a quicker car. Hamilton has executed almost to perfection but Vettel and Ferrari, with their best shot at the championship in a decade, have been left to rue errors that are likely to leave them empty-handed.Hamilton’s form has allowed no breathing space and the past six races make for painful reading at Ferrari. Hamilton’s run in Germany, to win in the rain from 14th, was huge and in contrast to the mistake that led to Vettel crashing. Pole in the wet in Hungary proved vital to the win in the next round for Hamilton who, when then outpaced at Spa, ensured he minimised the damage with second place.At Ferrari’s home race at Monza Vettel crashed into Hamilton, who was passing him. The German’s spin meant he finished fourth as Hamilton took the flag. Then in Singapore, where a Ferrari fightback was expected, Hamilton simply turned the screw. His qualifying lap at Marina Bay was possibly the best of his career and unmatchable. He converted it to a win and it was followed by another in Russia when Mercedes opted to ensure Vettel was shown no quarter by employing team orders.Always strong in the second half of the season, this run has been far from solely down to Hamilton. The team have had to develop and work harder and better than ever. They go into the Japanese Grand Prix, which Hamilton has won four times, including three in the past four years, with a car that appears to have nosed ahead of the Ferrari for the first time since the British Grand Prix.“You have hopes you will improve and most years you get better and better through the year,” Hamilton said. “I didn’t know I was going to improve the way I have. The communication with my team has got better, the strategy gets better.”Vettel must be aware the game is all but up. Once again in Japan, a race he too has won four times, he must take the flag to keep his faint hopes alive and even then the mathematics point to Mexico City once more bringing the curtain down.He is having to take what he can from this glorious Suzuka circuit, the spectre of the big picture perhaps just too much to bear. “I don’t like the now or never approach,” he said. “I don’t think there’s much sense in that. No, I think you attack every weekend, every weekend is different, the track is different, the circumstances are different.“I love this track, it’s my favourite track, so I’d better enjoy it and not spoil it by starting to count the things that are against me and focus on the things that are working for me.”The difficulty is that of late so little has been going his way and if there was any pleasure to be had in practice it was Hamilton and Mercedes who were savouring it. He was the quickest driver in the morning and afternoon, with Vettel almost a second down in both sessions. There was a distinct impression that, as in 2017, Japan heralds the beginning of the endgame for Hamilton.“We just want to get it done,” he said. “You want to get the championship whenever you can. As long as you cross the finish line in the lead that’s really all that matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfa08bf44527df3920e2f066170dc514171d1e02/2_71_4596_2759/master/4596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74883734a26d14537e2e32cbb17c6b12","title":"tom youngs rugby leicester","story":"Sometimes we forget that rugby is just a game and those who play it are human beings. The outcome of Northampton’s game against Leicester at Twickenham on Saturday matters, of course, but so does raising funds for the injured Wallaby Rob Horne, whose right arm has been paralysed since last April’s fixture between the two sides. To adapt the wise cricketing maxim of CLR James, what do they know of rugby who only rugby know?It has been a particularly big week for perspective. On Tuesday the remarkable Matt Hampson, such an inspiration to so many at Leicester and beyond, opened his Get Busy Living centre for people who, like him, have suffered life-altering sporting injuries. Joe Marler, meanwhile, has quit Test rugby at the peak of his powers to spend more time with his family. The oval ball gives plenty but it can also exact a hefty toll.Few are better acquainted with the emotional highs and lows than Leicester’s captain Tom Youngs, for whose family the past few years have been particularly difficult. Thankfully his wife Tiffany is now in full cancer remission – “She’s doing really well, she’s flying along” – after being told last year she might have as little as four weeks to live.Only latterly has her husband appreciated what a stressful a period it was: “I probably didn’t realise how much emotion it was taking out of me. I’d be tired and a little bit lethargic in games and my engine would blow up quicker than normal. I’d be thinking: ‘Why? I can’t be fit enough any more.’ This year I feel loads better, the body feels almost springy. I feel like a new man.”Listening to the 31-year-old hooker reflecting on those fraught times this week, it seems incredible he scarcely missed a match. “I’d be in situations where I’d be having to get our daughter Maisie out of bed at 3am in order to take Tiffany to hospital because she wasn’t well at all. I’d drop Tiff at the front door, head home again and then be playing against Toulon the next day.” Few at the club knew the half of it. “My thought process was pretty straightforward. I could either let it affect me or test myself and show some character. I didn’t tell anyone about it. No one knew, apart perhaps from my brother and my parents. I’d only tell people afterwards. I didn’t need to worry them.”The occasional missed lineout, in such circumstances, barely rates. The fact Leicester were also losing matches, however, made things even harder. “There were some very dark times. When Tiffany was ill, rugby was a release for me, an opportunity to let frustrations out, but there’s also severe pressure. Leicester were losing six on the bounce and you’ve got all these other things going on. It’s very tough. But I’m quite a positive person. I like to crack on.”He has also found it can help to talk more openly. “Some people found it too hard to ask me. You have to respect them for that. There was just this elephant in the room. If someone did ask me I’d tell them, without going into too much detail.” Only now, with Tiffany on the mend, can he switch his full attention to nursing Leicester back to health.The Tigers have long been a genuine family concern at the Youngs’ farmstead in Norfolk: Tom, his brother Ben and their father Nick have all represented Leicester and England and the club’s recent pain has been keenly felt. Wallowing in the league’s bottom half with a demanding European pool looming and an interim head coach, Geordan Murphy, at the helm is not what the scrum doctor ordered.Youngs, characteristically, refuses to duck the truth – “It’s been a shitfight” – nor swerve some uncomfortable home truths. “Leicester as a club have sat still a little bit and I don’t think they’re ashamed to say that. Looking at all the coaches we’ve been through it obviously hasn’t been right. It’s very hard to build a team and momentum if the foundations aren’t quite right. There are little things we’re trying to improve in the environment to get those foundations rock solid again.”Among them has been reminding everyone that the traditionally lofty expectations around the Tigers are no longer mirrored in present-day reality. “There are too many people coming through our door who just expect it to happen by putting this badge on,” continues Youngs, patting his chest for emphasis. “You have to go back to your roots and realise it’s not just about putting the shirt on. When we won stuff we worked incredibly hard. It doesn’t just happen. We’ve lost that a little bit. The Worcester game last month probably showcased where we were at. It was pretty emotional on the following Tuesday. Unfortunately in professional sport, things don’t just change overnight. It’s not going to be done by the end of this month, it’s not going to be done by Christmas.”In Murphy, at least, they have an insider who cares deeply. “He used a good metaphor the other day,” reports Youngs. “He said to the players: ‘Right, the ship’s out on the water, it’s been damaged a fair bit. Now it’s my turn to patch it up and build a battleship’.” The club captain sounds similarly driven: “Sometimes you do think: ‘Can I keep doing this?’ But I absolutely love playing rugby and the fire’s still in the belly. I’ve only got a few years left, I don’t bury myself in a fitness session not to achieve anything. I want to be a part of rebuilding Leicester again. The club has given me a lot and I want to be here to fix it up and get it ready to go again. If I can even help one per cent towards that happening I’ll be a happy man.”If anyone deserves to revisit the sunlit uplands it is the impressively resilient Youngs family. In the shorter term, however, there is Rob Horne to think about. “If we can help him to help his family and take away some of the worries he has about life in his head that’s what it’s about,” stresses Youngs, his voice softening once more. “You’ve got to remember we are human beings. It’s a massive game this weekend but there are other things going on in life outside rugby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a14368a7f556935a32fc8e0b36451ff0f0296cb/0_216_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858d20bdfa4ece0438948d26ef8bb104","title":"ufc 229 preview conor mcgregor khabib","story":"The UFC’s star problem will be forgotten, for one night at least, as Conor McGregor makes his long-awaited octagon returnDana White wasn’t certain this day would ever come.At times he was pretty confident it\u0026nbspwouldn’t. After all, Conor McGregor just struck it rich. Sure, he was\u0026nbspalready\u0026nbspwhat any common person would deem wealthy from his prior fighting exploits.As UFC’s biggest star, McGregor was routinely earning millions. The last time he entered the octagon – a second-round knockout of Eddie Alvarez in November 2016 – the Irishman raked in a guaranteed $3m that soared past five when pay-per-view upside was calculated.But when he crossed over into boxing for a megafight with Floyd Mayweather last summer, he banked an eight-figure payday.So the mere sight of the sport’s biggest attraction once again sitting on the dais two days before a major fight brought a smile to the UFC president’s face Thursday.“When a guy makes $100m, you don’t know if he’s ever gonna fight again. Conor made a lot of money and I’m sure he had a lot of fun and did what he wanted to do,” White said. “No matter how much you make, you can only sit home for so long and you start to go crazy.”McGregor didn’t just sit at home, though. And he\u0026nbspdid\u0026nbspgo crazy. He made an unexpected appearance at UFC 223 media day in April and proceeded to project a handtruck at a bus transporting many of his fellow fighters, including Khabib Nurmagomedov.The dolly was actually aimed at Nurmagomedov, whom McGregor will meet Saturday at UFC 229 at T-Mobile Arena. Nurmagomedov was involved in a dustup with McGregor’s buddy, Artem Lobov, earlier that week, sending the Notorious One into a rage.The fracas resulted in several injuries, many fight cancellations and a bevy of lawsuits. He was arrested and charged with three counts of assault. At the time, White casted doubt on McGregor’s status in UFC moving forward.“Do you want to be in business with Conor McGregor right now?” White asked in April immediately following the incident. “Do you want to chase this guy around for interviews and buy his fights? Do you?“I don’t think anybody is going to want to right now. I think everybody is going to be pretty disgusted with Conor McGregor right now. Listen, you don’t like Khabib and you don’t like what happened or whatever? Then fight Khabib.”McGregor is doing just that, and the act White once called “criminal, disgusting, despicable,” is now being used as a promotional vehicle – in video highlights and other materials – to hype the highly anticipated showdown. That’s show business.Since the advent of sanctioned prized fighting in the 1800s, promoters have used any available tool – both real and imagined – to sell tickets. White can’t be blamed for changing his tune just a few months later.So yes, White indeed\u0026nbspdoes\u0026nbspwant to be in business with Conor McGregor. He’s not just the most recognizable name in UFC, but in combat sports as a whole.“You can tell this guy is passionate about fighting,” White said. “He loves it. He loves breaking records and he loves making money.”And money he shall make. White projects the event could surpass 3m pay-per-view buys, which would shatter the previous record set by who else? McGregor, whose rematch victory over Nate Diaz in 2016 generated 1.65m buys.With all the legitimate bad blood swirling between both camps, and a tantalizing matchup, maybe White’s prediction will prove right. McGregor is actually the underdog this time. Oddsmakers at Bovada peg Khabib as a slight favorite at minus-160 to McGregor’s plus-130.The 30-year-old Russian is undefeated and hungry. He also matches up well with McGregor as a highly skilled wrestler who finds way to score takedowns time and again.McGregor, 30, is at his best when he’s on his feet and able to deliver his pulverizing strikes. Following an eight-week training camp to prepare for Mayweather and nine-plus rounds that followed in the ring, Mystic Mac’s boxing ability figures to be much-improved.But he must contend with a two-year layoff from the sport he’s actually participating in, and a hungry, determined opponent who is looking to etch his name in lore.\u0026nbsp“I think beginning of first round I have to be careful with him because he has good boxing but my wrestling is my pressure,” Nurmagomedov said Thursday. “He has to kill me to stop me. I’m going to finish this guy and stop this guy and this is my plan.”That was the nature of McGregor’s threats. At various times Thursday he vowed to “knock that man’s nose into the nose bleeds,” and “put a hole in this man’s head”.“I do not give a fuck. I’m ruthless here. I’m here to put a hole in this man’s skull,” McGregor promised. “I’m starving for this man’s head.”Khabib possesses the superior grappling ability, and McGregor has tapped out once before (first meeting with Diaz in 2016 when he submitted to a rear-naked chokehold.) Bravado and violent taunts aside, McGregor has a plan.“I’ve been grappling and wrestling much heavier man this whole camp. 200-pounders, 25 minutes straight,” McGregor said. “I am ready for all outcomes. I feel once I hit him he’s going to turn weak. I expect panic in him early.“I also don’t give a bollocks. I’ve experienced it all. I’ve gotten fucking tired in there. I’ve been on my back in there. I’ve been in every scenario you can be in under the brightest lights in the entire world. I am a veteran. I am here to enjoy this because this is what I love.”Enjoy McGregor now, because win or lose, who knows if or when he’ll be back. He was noncommittal to fighting again after Saturday. And this is\u0026nbspbefore\u0026nbsphe’ll earn another pile of money that promises to rank as the best payday of his UFC career.With Ronda Rousey gone, the UFC is short on stars, but for now, White has his brightest. Now he needs Conor to not just win, but stick around for a while.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33ae2d3b66b6a30d28666f72d85ed17caba15c6a/0_70_2806_1684/master/2806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfab959af6a3884f14c85705c4982771","title":"denis mukwege nadia murad nobel peace prize 2018","story":"Gynaecologist Denis Mukwege and Yazidi campaigner Nadia Murad are jointly awardedTwo leaders of the struggle against sexual violence in war have won this year’s Nobel peace prize, a choice that will hearten campaigners fighting for greater recognition of a grave but long-neglected problem, and may also bring hope to victims worldwide that their suffering has at last been recognised.The Norwegian Nobel committee said that Denis Mukwege, a doctor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nadia Murad, a 25-year-old Yazidi activist, had been awarded the prize “for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict”.Mukwege, 63, has spent decades caring for victims of sexual assault in his homeland. Murad has used her own story of enslavement and rape by Islamic State to publicise human rights abuses.The Nobel committee said on Friday that both had “put their own personal security at risk by courageously combating war crimes and securing justice for victims.” Mukwege was in surgery when he heard he had won the peace prize. He learned he had won because he heard colleagues and patients crying. “I can see in the faces of many women how they are happy to be recognised,” he said.Murad said: “I share this award with all Yazidis, with all the Iraqis, Kurds and all the minorities and all survivors of sexual violence around the world.As a survivor, I am grateful for this opportunity to draw international attention to the plight of the Yazidi people who have suffered unimaginable crimes since the genocide by Daesh (Isis).”The choice has been universally applauded. Some recent awards have been controversial: the former US president Barack Obama won in 2009 after less than a year in office, and the European Union won in 2012. Last year’s winner was the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.This year’s peace prize announcement comes amid a heightened attention to the sexual abuse of women in war, in the workplace and in society that has been highlighted by the “#MeToo” movement.The committee said: “Both laureates have made a crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, war crimes. Denis Mukwege is the helper who has devoted his life to defending these victims. Nadia Murad is the witness who tells of the abuses perpetrated against herself and others.“Each of them in their own way has helped to give greater visibility to war-time sexual violence, so that the perpetrators can be held accountable for their actions.”Mukwege, a gynaecologist, founded and maintains the Panzi hospital in Bukavu, in the east of the DRC, where he has cared for tens of thousands of women who suffered sexual assault in the country’s recurrent civil conflict. Mukwege survived a kidnapping attempt in 2012 but has continued his work.The committee described him as “the foremost, most unifying symbol both nationally and internationally of the struggle to end sexual violence in war and armed conflict”.Murad was abducted with other Yazidi women in August 2014 when their home village of Kocho in Sinjar, northern Iraq, was attacked by Isis. Captured alongside her sisters, she lost six brothers and her mother as the extremists killed the village’s men and any women considered too old to be sexually exploited.She eventually escaped and had shown uncommon courage in repeatedly recounting her own sufferings and speaking up on behalf of other victims, the committee said.Murad is the second youngest Nobel peace prize laureate after Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she won in 2014.The announcement was welcomed by prominent campaigners and organisations.“Well deserved and long awaited Nobel recognition of the fight against sexual violence in war, said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch.Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said he had first proposed Mukwege for the award 10 years ago. “The best Nobel Prize in a long time. Finally focus on horrific \u0026amp widespread sexual violence in war. Must lead to action against impunity for perpetrators \u0026amp preventive action within armies \u0026amp militias,” Egeland tweeted.A spokesperson for German chancellor Angela Merkel, herself tipped as a potential laureate, said she has great respect for the work of both winners.Murad came to Germany in 2015 as part of a special program for female victims of violence and met Merkel in 2016 to discuss her work helping others.The Dr Denis Mukwege Foundation, a Netherlands-based international human rights organisation working to end sexual violence in wars, for whom the gynaecologist is an advisor, said the the Nobel prize committee had sent a clear message that sexual violence in wars is unacceptable and must stop.“We will continue to work with Dr Mukwege and his team, as well as Nadia Murad, towards a world in which sexual violence as a method of warfare is abolished and survivors receive the care they need,” it said in a statement.The government of Iraq recognised Murad’s courageous campaigning on behalf of victims of sexual violence during conflict.Authorities in the DRC have congratulated Mukwege, while acknowledging that relations have been strained over the years. Mukwege in the past has criticised the government and accused its troops of a culture of sexual violence.Lambert Mende, the minister of information, said that Mukwege has done “remarkable work” treating victims of sexual violence during years of conflict in the country’s east.Mende said “we have not always been in agreement”, adding that Mukwege has had a tendency to “politicise” his humanitarian work. However, he said: “We salute that a compatriot is recognised.”Mukwege, the son of a pastor, trained as an obstetrician in France. The first patient treated in the maternity clinic he founded was a rape survivor. Over two decades later, his Panzi Hospital has treated more than 50,000 women and girls.As well as physical treatment, Mukwege created an approach that focused on providing psychological and socioeconomic support to the survivors, as well as founding a legal programme to help them obtain justice.Beginning in 2013, he and his team had to care for dozens of young girls from the town of Kavumu who were taken from their beds and raped by a militia led by a provincial member of parliament who believed raping children would protect them from their enemies.This year, 216 iniduals and 115 organisations were nominated for the prize. They included the Syrian civilian aid group the White Helmets, Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper, the US whistleblower Edward Snowden and the UN high commissioner for refugees. The 2018 prize is worth just over a million dollars.One recent controversy has involved Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the award for her fierce resistance to the repressive junta in Myanmar. She has recently been criticised for failing to act to stop violence directed at the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority.The potential winners touted by bookies this year included some isive names: Kim Jong-un and Monn Jae-in were among the favourites (jointly) for their steps towards rapprochement between North and South Korea, followed by Donald Trump, for the same reason."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59fb653afac6e99ff43c86224a0dcc18f4e1878f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a5690c48fb44943c0d044d11616b60f","title":"sweden true queen pulls ancient sword from lake","story":"An eight-year-old girl has pulled a 1,500-year-old sword from a lake in southern Sweden.“I felt something with my hand and at first I thought it was a stick,” Saga Nevecek told the local Värnamo Nyheter newspaper. “Then it had a handle that looked like it was a sword, and then I lifted it up and shouted: ‘Daddy, I found a sword!’”The find, made in July but announced only this week for fear it would trigger a summer stampede to the site at Tånnö on the shore of Lake Vidöstern, felt “pretty cool and a bit exciting”, she told the Swedish public broadcaster Sveriges Radio.Despite intense speculation on social media, there was no immediate confirmation that Saga would be crowned “Queen of Sweden”, in an echo of the Arthurian legends of the sword in the stone and the lady of the lake.Her father, Andrew, said in a Facebook post that the sword, estimated by experts from the nearby Jönköping county museum to date to the 5th or 6th century AD, before the Viking era, was still in the remains of its wood and leather scabbard.He told VN he had been waiting impatiently for his daughter to come in from the water because the football World Cup final was about to start, but she was busy skimming stones. Then she stooped and held up the ancient weapon.Neighbours confirmed to the Swedish-American family, who moved to Sweden from Minnesota last year, that the rusted artefact did indeed look old, and Nevecek called an archaeologist the next day.Annie Rosén, from the museum, said: “I was on holiday, but when I saw the pictures I went straight away. You cannot imagine such a sword – so well preserved.”Another expert at the museum, Mikael Nordström, told the Local.se news site that the 85cm sword was being worked on by conservationists and would not be on view to the public for at least a year.“How it came to be there, we don’t know,” Nordström said, adding that archaeologists no longer believed the site was the grave of a wealthy nobleman, as first thought. They were exploring the possibility it could have been a place of sacrifice, he said. Subsequent searches by museum staff and local council workers uncovered a brooch from roughly the same period but there were no other significant finds."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Sean Doyle (37) had claimed he fell over and passed out after he hit an alleged humpI-Res says Sandyford apartment block not subject to rent pressure zone restrictionsThere are just two seminaries left to train diocesan priests for Ireland: the seminary at Maynooth and the Irish College in RomeGeorge Mitchell sends support, calling for deal negotiators to show political courageFinal \u0026lsquosummary for policymakers\u0026rsquo will be main scientific guide for combating climate change over coming years\u0026lsquoWhen first built it was almost too small \u0026ndash people came early to Mass to get a seat!\u0026rsquoBrexit is \u0026lsquoimploding\u0026rsquo and a second referendum is likely, according to Lord AdonisExecutive apologises to women who did not have cancer for distress caused by letters\u0026lsquoYou have taken from the world a girl, who believed in caring, sharing and loving,\u0026rsquo brother saysNurses and midwives hope \u0026lsquocurrent protections will apply in the future\u0026rsquoDepartment of Education accused of \u0026lsquocapitulating\u0026rsquo to lobbying on religion rulesFares unchanged on Go Ahead Ireland buses but frequency and routes may be alteredInvestigatory body urges campaign about dangers of intoxication while at seaNoel Kirwan was sitting in his new Ford Mondeo when he was shot dead in 2016Stefan Condurovici had only been in Ireland for a day when he was caught by garda\u0026iacuteSaga Vanecek stepped on blade believed to be about 1,500 years old when helping father with boatPaul Slevin, described by garda\u0026iacute as \u0026lsquoharmless sort of fellow\u0026rsquo, pleaded guilty to drug chargesSignificant payment due to exchequer later this year as multinationals pay more taxA Garda has been suspended from duties pending the outcome of a criminal investigationHeads of Remainer parties tell Barnier and Verhofstadt of need to mitigate Brexit effects"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3652858.1538759205!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kavanaugh confirmation looks assured as flake pledges support","story":"As Republicans move to schedule a final vote on US supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for the end of the week, thousands of women including actresses Amy Schumer and Emily Ratajkowski demonstrated outside the Supreme Court on Thursday (October 4).\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tComedian Amy Schumer is led away after she was arrested during a protest against the proposed confirmation of supreme court nominee  Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Senators had earlier voted by 51 to 49 to proceed with a final vote on US president Donald Trump’s nominee, possibly as early as Saturday. Democratic senator Joe Manchin voted with the Republican caucus in support of a motion to advance Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination to a final vote on the Senate floor. Mr Manchin is running for re-election next month in a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2016, and had faced pressure from many of his constituents to endorse the Republican nominee. However, Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska, voted against the motion.Two other senators whose stance was considered to be in doubt, Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, voted to allow the confirmation to proceed to a final vote. It remained unclear whether they would support Mr Kavanaugh in that final vote, but Mr Flake said later on Friday that he would do so unless something big changed, and he did not expect that to happen.Ms Collins is to make her final intentions known at 8pm Irish time on Friday, but even if she votes against Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation, it seems unlikely that opponents of his promotion to the supreme court can garner the 51-seat majority they need in the Senate to block it. Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation has been delayed by allegations against him of past sexual misconduct, made by three women. One of them, Christine Blasey Ford, testified before the Senate judiciary committee last week, before Mr Kavanaugh delivered an angry rebuttal of her claim that he sexually assaulted her when they were both high school students.Hundreds of women – including comedian Amy Schumer – were detained by Capitol police on Thursday as protesters against Mr Kavanaugh’s proposed confirmation filled the Senate office building.Mr Kavanaugh made a last-minute appeal to senators in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal overnight, in which he addressed his performance at the Senate judiciary committee last week. “I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times,” he wrote. “I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad.“Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good. As a judge, I have always treated colleagues and litigants with the utmost respect. I have been known for my courtesy on and off the bench. I have not changed.”But in an editorial, the Washington Post called on senators not to endorse Mr Kavanaugh. It was the first time the newspaper has opposed a supreme court nominee since 1987. In particular, the newspaper’s editorial board highlighted his comments during his testimony last week in which he said he was the victim of an “orchestrated hit” motivated by anger at President Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election and revenge on behalf of the Clintons. “He provided neither evidence nor even a plausible explanation for this red-meat partisanship, but he poisoned any sense that he could serve as an impartial judge,” the editorial said.Mr Kavanaugh was giving evidence to the judiciary committee on Thursday of last week after testimony had been given earlier the same day by Dr Blasey Ford, a California-based university professor who says he sexually assaulted her in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17.Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, who attended university with Mr Kavanaugh, claimed he thrust his exposed genitals in her face at a drunken party when they were in college. A third accuser, Julie Swetnick, said she observed Mr Kavanaugh at parties where women were verbally abused, inappropriately touched and “gang-raped”.Dozens of protesters who were demonstrating inside the Senate building were arrested on Thursday. Many were chanting: “We want justice now” and holding signs in support of Dr Blasey Ford.Senators had spent much of the day poring over the confidential FBI report on Mr Kavanaugh in a secure room in the Capitol building.\u0026nbspSenate majority leader Mitch Mc Connell said the FBI report “did not corroborate” any of the accusations of sexual misconduct that have been alleged against Mr Kavanaugh. Thist was echoed by Senate judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley, who said there was “no hint of misconduct”.“There’s nothing in it that we didn’t already know,” he said. “It’s time to vote.”But Democrats criticised the scope of the FBI investigation, which was ordered last Friday by the White House at the behest of Mr Flake, who said that his support for Mr Kavanaugh was conditional on an investigation taking place“We had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all of the facts,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said. “Those fears have been realised.”The White House expressed confidence that Mr Kavanaugh would be endorsed.“This is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a supreme court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record and over a half million pages of documents,” deputy press secretary Ray Shah said on Thursday.Mr Trump also backed his nominee on Twitter. “Wow, such enthusiasm and energy for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Look at the Energy, look at the Polls. Something very big is happening. He is a fine man and great intellect. The country is with him all the way!”He said that the “harsh and unfair” treatment of Mr Kavanaugh was having “an incredible upward impact on voters”.“The PEOPLE get it far better than the politicians. Most importantly, this great life cannot be ruined by mean \u0026amp despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations!”"},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

The public can also join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict.Boyle said that as a small nation, surrounded by beaches, the locations for the tributes were a great stage. Beaches are unruly, democratic places, he said, where nobody rules other than the tide.Pages Of The Sea is described as an informal, nationwide gesture of remembrance for the men and women who left their home shores during the First World War.Poet Carol Ann Duffy has been invited to write a new poem, which will be read by iniduals, families and communities as they gather on the beaches.Former St Andrews student wins £80,000 damages from man cleared of raping herComment: The Kavanaugh affair is ugly, but it exposes our ignorance of British judges\u0026#39 political biasesVegan activists banned from organic chain Whole Foods amid animal welfare claimsStars take aim at Sir Philip Green as feminist stall torn down in Oxford Street Topshop\u0026#39Everybody do the Bolsonaro guns!\u0026#39 -

This Academy is more widely known as the GRU Conservatory.In a further incredible security lapse, Bellingcat also discovered a Russian vehicle ownership database that listed Aleksey Morenets as the registered user and perhaps also the owner of a Lada car, registration number VAZ 21093. As well as his name, his passport number, verified in the October 4 disclosure, was included on the vehicle document.This car is registered at the address Komsomolsky Prospekt 20, the address thought to be the headquarters of Unit 26165. Other vehicles registered to the same address revealed the names of a further 305 iniduals. These people were all aged between 27 to 53, Bellingcat revealed, all well within the ages of military service.All 305 names had passport numbers and, in most cases, mobile telephone numbers attached. All information can be found on the publicly-available automobile registration database.The  understands that registering a private car using the GRU’s address would mean the inidual would not need to pay car tax and would be ignored for any traffic offences.Bob Seely, the Tory MP who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said: It is extraordinarily unprofessional on the part of the GRU. It shows that subversion is probably beyond their professional capability - they can\u0027t even cover their tracks in the most basic of ways. It is very sloppy and makes President Putin look foolish.We need to be finding out where all these people have been travelling. 305 is the best part of a battalion  - let\u0027s find how many of them have been to the UK and whereabouts.This image released by the Dutch Defense Ministry on Thursday Oct. 4, 2018 shows the diplomatic passport of Aleksei Morenets, one of four Russian officers of the GRU.Mr Seely has said he will unveil the real identity of the second Skripal suspect - hitherto known under the pseudonym Alexander Petrov - in a joint event with Bellingcat in Britain’s House of Commons on October 9.Speaking exclusively to the , Carnegie Moscow Centre analyst and former Russian diplomat Alexander Baunov argued that since the 1990s and 2000s, when Russia was impoverished and friendly with the US and Europe, the once-formidable GRU has lagged behind Western spy agencies.It now finds itself unprepared for the Cold War level of tension and scrutiny that followed the annexation of Crimea, he suggests, and vulnerable to innovations like online open-source investigations.Mark Galeotti, a scholar of Russian security services, has argued that the GRU\u0027s sometimes crude methods stem from its previous focus on special forces operations which has only recently been shifted toward the covert actions typical of a traditional intelligence agency. Writing last week he said GRU was a particularly aggressive service with a “wartime mindset,” now at the forefront of “Moscow\u0027s murderous active measures campaign abroad”.Please review our commenting policyFormer St Andrews student wins £80,000 damages from man cleared of raping herComment: The Kavanaugh affair is ugly, but it exposes our ignorance of British judges\u0026#39 political biasesVegan activists banned from organic chain Whole Foods amid animal welfare claimsStars take aim at Sir Philip Green as feminist stall torn down in Oxford Street Topshop\u0026#39Everybody do the Bolsonaro guns!\u0026#39 - meet the pistol-toting military candidates vying for power in Brazil’s isive electionBrett Kavanaugh: Supreme Court nomination passes crucial first voteIndonesia death toll could rise drastically, as aid starts to arriveComment: How the Scottish Labour car crash may keep Jeremy Corbyn out of No. 10Sadistic German couple who tortured and killed women in \u0026#39House of Horrors\u0026#39 are jailed Danny Boyle calls for public help to mark Armistice Day on Britain\u0026#39s beachesFootage shows Ronaldo dancing with rape accuser in Las VegasEnchanting Roman villa adorned with writhing snakes and peacocks is discovered in PompeiiComment: Don\u0026#39t blame me if my cheap clothes addiction is destroying the planetBerlin becomes latest German city to draw up diesel ban Britain faces more than a decade in EU trade limbo once Brexit deal signedShock poll predicts Merkel\u0026#39s Bavarian sister party CSU could lose power for first time since Second World WarEx-Eurotunnel boss sobs as homeless man who pushed him on Tube tracks is found guilty of attempted murderBored to death: What happened when a modern art gallery held a séance\u0026#39Fake news?\u0026#39 Non, c\u0026#39est \u0026#39information fallacieuse, say French language policeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/01/10/iphone.jpg","title":"apple amazon china chip us bloomberg report latest truth explained","story":"Created with Sketch.Join us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsPeople purchase the new iPhone XS and XS Max at the Apple store in Midtown Manhattan on September 21, 2018 in New York CityIf the hack on Apple, Amazon and the US defense establishment\u0026nbspis real, it would be one of the most spectacular cyberattacks ever carried outClick to followThe Independent TechBritish security services have spoken out about claims that China managed to plant tiny chips in computers that made their way across the US.The bombshell report came from Bloomberg News this week and alleged that special agents in the People\u0027s Liberation Army had dropped tiny components into computer hardware before it left the country.

The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of UK spy agency GCHQ, said that it agreed with those denials from the two companies.Apple and Amazon deny report they were hit by huge Chinese hack“We aware of the media reports but at this stage have no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS and Apple, an\u0026nbspNCSC\u0026nbspspokesperson said.“The NCSC engages confidentially with security researchers and urges anybody with credible intelligence about these reports to contact us.”The denial came after Apple and Amazon – the two companies named in the report – both emphatically rejected the content of the report. They both said they were unaware of the claims and had undertaken detailed investigations to find any chips and had discovered nothing.Apple even published a special page on its website, under the title What Businessweek got wrong about Apple, that took all of the claims on in detail. It said on that page that there is no truth to these claims, that it never found malicious chips, and that its contacts in law enforcement had not heard of such a case either.As we have previously informed Bloomberg, this is completely untrue, Apple concluded.\u0026nbspApple has never found malicious chips in our servers.Finally, in response to questions we have received from other news organisations since Businessweek published its story, we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is their victory and nothing to do with any politicians, despite what they might have you believe\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentUnilever had planned to consolidate its headquarters at its base in RotterdamPoliticians of varying stripes were quick to jump on marmite maker Unilever’s decision to abandon plans to pull its headquarters out of London, and its shares out of the FTSE 100, and no wonder. It’s created quite the froth.\u0026nbspBut let’s be quite clear: This is not their victory, whatever their stripe.\u0026nbspIt is not down to London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Kahn and it has nothing to do with any efforts made by Theresa May’s Tory Government. As for the ramshackle army of gloating Brexiteers? They can belt up too.\u0026nbspUnilever scraps plans to move HQ from London to RotterdamLegal \u0026amp General vows to vote against Unilever’s planned Dutch moveThis was, in point of fact, a battle fought and won through the prosaic virtue\u0026nbspof responsible engagement and activism by big City institutions acting\u0026nbspin the interests of the people who invest with them, which is not something that they always do.\u0026nbspUnilever moving its headquarters out of the UK and abandoning its dual headed Anglo-Dutch corporate structure would have seen it ejected from both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE All Share indices.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspwould have forced funds run by the likes Legal \u0026amp General, Standard Life, Aviva and others, to sell up (full disclosure, I have\u0026nbspfunds that track FTSE\u0026nbspindices\u0026nbspand Unilever’s presence within them thus benefits me) because of the rules they operate under.\u0026nbspAs a result, there would have been an awful lot of stock hitting the market in a short time, which would have depressed the selling price. But Unilever’s London exit - a Lexit? - would also have deprived their funds of a high quality, well run, company\u0026nbspa reliable performer with a reliable idend that is\u0026nbspthe sort of hardy perennial every investor needs.\u0026nbspIt was thus very much in the interests of the\u0026nbspclients of London institutions\u0026nbspfor them to say no, and for them to do so publicly, as a number of big fund managers did (but not, sadly, BlackRock, a heavy hitting index\u0026nbsptracker manager).This left Unilever, which needed to secure the support of 75 per cent of its UK shareholders, facing a potentially embarrassing defeat.\u0026nbspIn the City you don’t hold a vote you can’t win if you can help it, so it sensibly withdrew.\u0026nbspNot happily, mind. The statement it issued explaining the decision had\u0026nbspthe feeling of a Scooby Doo style “we’d have got away with it if it weren’t for those meddling kids”.I imagine there will be some strained conversations between a board that robustly defended the plan - “guided by the opportunity to unlock value for our shareholders by creating a stronger, simpler and more competitive Unilever” - and investors over the coming months.\u0026nbspShareholder value was clearly not the sole issue in bringing this forward, however.\u0026nbspForget Brexit. Going Dutch would have made it much harder for the likes of Kraft Foods to come forward with opportunistic, and bad, bids in future because of the regulations in that country. Remember, Unilever only narrowly avoided getting taken out by Kraft last year.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the thirty years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president\u0027s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or \u0027hurt your economies\u0027Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers \u0027alarming\u0027 drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be \u0027optimistic\u0027 about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers. Because the price of those goods is set internationally some businesses in those sectors have become less competitive or even unviable.\u0026nbspToo much finance also inflicts the costs of recurrent crises, which the study puts at £1.8 trillion between 1995 and 2015.Professor Andrew Baker, co-author of the report and Professorial Fellow at the University of Sheffield, said the numbers hint at a “deep underlying problem” caused by the UK’s financial sector.“UK economic strategy in a post-Brexit world needs to make addressing this the central challenge, recognising that where finance is concerned, more can sometimes be less, and less could be more,” he said.John Christensen, a director at the Tax Justice Network who helped develop the framework for the research, witnessed the effects of the “finance curse” in his former role as economic adviser to the island of Jersey.“This new evidence overturns the entrenched orthodoxy that what is good for the City of London must be good for the rest of Britain,” Mr Christensen said.“For decades City interests have been inflicting a finance curse on the UK economy, inflating the exchange rate, slowing growth of the productive sectors, and lobbying governments into deregulating financial services, which led directly to the 2008 banking crisis.\u0026nbsp“UK productivity has fallen dramatically behind most EU member states, and excess household and corporate debt is holding back growth.Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 Barclays CEO under investigation for trying to identify whistleblower - Monday Paril 10Authorities have launched an investigation into Barclays chief executive officer Jes Staley for trying to identify a whistleblower, the bank said on Monday.221 UK to crack down on bank money laundering after reports of £65bn Russian scam, City minister says -  March 2017The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has vowed that the Government will crack down on money laundering practices, after several of the UK\u0027s biggest banks were accused of processing money from a Russian scam, believed to involve up to $80bn (£65bn).321 Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m loan scam - February 2017Two former HBOS bankers were among six people found guilty of bribery and fraud that cost customers and shareholders hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC reports.421 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). 621 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any damage done to the group\u0027s reputation.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France\u0027s highest appeals court has ruled.821 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York\u0027s JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports.921 Former PwC employees found guilty in \u0027Luxleaks\u0027 tax scandal - June 2016Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.1021 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But you do have an upward revision to the prior month’s increase and there is evidence of some downward effect from the hurricane,” said Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank in New York.“The overall picture is that the labour market remains solid and robust. You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It was an emotional day to say the least,” Evans tweeted on Thursday night.“Playing this role over the last 8 years has been an honor. To everyone in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in the audience, thank you for the memories! Eternally grateful.”The as-yet-untitled fourth Avengers movie\u0026nbspwill be Marvel’s 22nd film and Evans’ 10th as Steve Rogers AKA\u0026nbspCaptain America, the superhero supergroup’s tactician and cool head in fiery situations.Evans’ tweet has had a staggering 246,000 retweets\u0026nbspat the time of writing, with his farewell to the role receiving an outpouring of love from fans and colleagues alike.Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds tweeted: “I’m not crying. I’m weeping. There’s a difference,” with Dwayne Johnson adding: “What a run you had brother. Congrats on breathing life into such an iconic character. Keep on keeping’ on.”Though Captain America didn’t appear\u0026nbspin the Marvel Cinematic Universe until five movies in, he is seen as one of the original Avengers, having fought all manner of evil forces alongside Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor and others.Evans’ exit won’t come as a huge surprise as he has previously spoken about wanting “to get off the train before they push you off,” and Avengers: Infinity War left the fate of several characters in the balance.It remains to be seen how his version of Captain America is written out in Avengers 4, one fan hoping it’s not one particularly sombre departure Steve Rogers made in the comics.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the thirty years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president\u0027s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or \u0027hurt your economies\u0027Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers \u0027alarming\u0027 drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be \u0027optimistic\u0027 about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers.

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But calls and texts will simply not come through.The easiest way to check whether any O2 phone is affected is to try and call another number. If that handset is affected then it will simply fail to connect.The issue was confirmed on phones in\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s office.

This was fixed within 40 minutes. Some customers may continue to experience some intermittent issues when reconnecting to the network. We’re investigating what happened and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.The outage came at the same time as O2 announced a new service, known as Popcorn Pass, which will give eligible customers 40 per cent off cinema tickts for two years.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets.The new moon is far bigger than any of the nearly 200 natural satellites that have been found in our own solar system. It is comparable in size to its\u0026nbspplanets, roughly the same size as Neptune – orbiting a planet as big as Jupiter.The two are floating around their own star 8,000 lightyears away.Nasa releases statement about bizarre International Space Station leakIt was found in the same way that scientists discovered those thousands of exoplanets: watching for the small dips that happens when they move in front of their star, and working out from those how big it is and what its orbit might be like.They looked at data from\u0026nbsp284 planets found in that way by the Kepler Space Telescope and tried to find those that had anything strange about their orbits.One of those planets, known as Kepler 1625b, seemed to be behaving strangely.\u0026nbspWe saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention, Kipping said.They watched the planet for some time, and noticed that soon after it passed in front of its star, there was another dip of light, which appeared to be a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.It also seemed to be passing in front of its star slightly sooner that might be expected, which would be consistent with the kind of wobble that would happen because of a moon\u0027s gravity.\u0026nbspAn extraterrestrial civilization watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earth\u0027s transit, Kipping said.It is possible that the strange behaviour could also be caused by another planet in the system, and hope for further data from space telescopes to confirm their findings. But at the moment a companion moon is the most convincing explanation for the dip in the light and the change in the orbit, they said.Exomoons are so difficult to find because they are so small, and as a consequence the dip they cause in the light coming from the star is much weaker than a larger planet. Their orbits also shift as they move around their star, because they orbiting their planet.The new moon was probably found first because its larger size made it easier to see.Both of the planets are within the habitable zone, where they are close enough to their star to get heat and support life but not so close that it would be killed by the intensity. But both planets are gaseous and so are unlikely to support life.The gaseous nature of the planet also lead to questions about where its Moon might have come from. Our Moon, for instance, is thought to have been formed when an earlier collision shot off material that would go on to become the rock we see today, but that could not happen if the two objects are made up of gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But\u0026nbspnow, once the Tory conference is over, we should get down to business.”Speaking alongside\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, the Irish president, Mr Tusk made clear the EU remained “united behind Ireland” in its determination to prevent a return to border posts and checks.But he also made clear his anger at the delay to Theresa May’s promised fresh border proposals – linking it to a reluctance to risk a backlash at the Tory conference.In Birmingham, Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, triggered fury across the EU by accusing it of trying to keep the UK in a “prison” with behaviour similar to the Soviet Union.After the Salzburg summit, the prime minister accused Mr Tusk of showing disrespect, but he tuned that accusation on the UK, saying: “In respecting our partners, we expect the same in return.“Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

A statement by the MEP said his expulsion had been “consequent” to the vote on Hungary, though the party says it was unrelated.“Having been a party worker for over 30 years and, having been a former group leader and party board member, I find this extremely disappointing,” Mr Ashworth said.“I always have been, and always will be, a Conservative. However, I am surprised that the party does not apply the same standards in Westminster and I am extremely concerned that this once broad church, pragmatic Conservative party has deserted the centre ground in favour of far-right ideology and intolerance.”Mr Ashworth was previously leader of the Conservative Party in the European Parliament from March 2012 to November 2013 and was first elected as an MEP in 2004.MEPs have been expelled from the Conservative party, having previously lost the whip\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)The Tories faced criticism back in the UK for siding with Hungary’s government in the vote because of its governing party’s record of antisemitism, Islamophobia, crackdowns on freedom of expression, and abuse of the rule of law.\u0026nbspJewish and Muslim leaders in the UK criticised the decision, while John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called on Theresa May to distance herself from the MEPs’ votes. She did not do so, and the Conservative party was sent a letter of thanks for its “solidarity” by the Hungarian government. Mr Orban also said he would work to get the UK a good Brexit deal.The party said it voted as it did because\u0026nbspit did not believe it was the European Parliament\u0027s place to censure Hungary\u0027s government.Mr Ashworth and Ms Girling earlier this year left the European Conservatives and Reformists political group in which the Tories sit and joined the mainstream centre-right grouping, the European People’s Party.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But you do have an upward revision to the prior month’s increase and there is evidence of some downward effect from the hurricane,” said Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank in New York.“The overall picture is that the labour market remains solid and robust. You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That will let people know how they are connected to WiFi, for instance, and tell them whether they should expect faster or slower speeds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

BREXIT BOMBSHELL: HMRC not preparing small traders for no-deal\u0026ldquoThe Unilever management had been acting in self interest to protect their jobs from a takeover but the shareholders knew that they needed access to London not Holland.\u0026ldquoThis is a slap in the face for the management of Unilever but also those who peddle Project Fear in this country.In reference to the companies products, he added: \u0026ldquoBrexit Britain clearly passes the Marmite test and this news will be of great Comfort to many in Britain.\u0026ldquoThe management\u0026rsquos analysis clearly didn\u0026rsquot cut the mustard and I suggest they get over it and go and have a cup of PG Tips.Former Brexit minister David Jones said: \u0026ldquoBritain passes the Marmite test. After the announcement that Unilever is keeping its headquarters in London, this is another massive vote of confidence in the UK after Brexit.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a clear sign that successful businesses see a bright future in Brexit Britain.When Unilever initially announced its decision to move its headquareers from Britain, Remainers seized on the announcement that it was a sign big companies were fleeing because of brexit.However, it has become the latest example of a company making an empty threat with the prospect of a no deal with BMW also admitting earlier this year that it would not quit Britain.The announcements have come after remorseless campaigning by Remainers to try to undermine the credibility of Britain after Brexit and claims it would \u0026ldquocrash out if there is no deal and have to rely on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.However, expects at Economists for Free Trade have pointed out that a no deal situation could boost Britain by \u0026pound1 trillion while hitting the EU by \u0026pound500 billion.There are also government plans revealed this week by the  to slash corporation tax and personal income tax in Britain to compete hard with the EU in the event of no deal.

PA1 of 21People took to the streets of London to march for a second EU referendumHe said: Unilever has built a long track record of consistent and competitive performance. The board continues to believe that simplifying our dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and serve the best long-term interests of Unilever.The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders. We will proceed with the plan to cancel the NV preference shares, further strengthening our corporate governance.Unilever first announced plans to simplify the business from two legal entities into a single one, incorporated in Rotterdam, in March.It dealt a major blow to the UK Government and its efforts to uphold Britain\u0027s status as a centre for business after Brexit.However, Unilever has throughout insisted the move to Rotterdam was nothing to do with Brexit.It also said at the time that its 7,300 workers in the UK and 3,100 in the Netherlands would be unaffected by the changes.A spokesman for the Investment Association said: The feedback from many of our members has been that there was no compelling reason for Plc shareholders to accept the proposed simplification in this form. They did not believe it would be in the long-term interests of their clients, and would have resulted in many shareholders being forced to sell their shares.We welcome the fact that Unilever has listened to the feedback from their shareholders and not pushed ahead with their plans. We look forward to engaging with the company on their future plans.Business Secretary Greg Clark said: Unilever has a long and proud history in the UK and I welcome this decision by Unilever\u0027s board having listened to its shareholders. Keeping Unilever\u0027s HQ in the UK builds on two of its three global businesses being based here.The UK is one of the best places in the world to grow a business and our modern Industrial Strategy commits us to being an open and competitive economy and a great place to locate global headquarters.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they always come back.“You’ll see them arguing among themselves about pitches and where they should stand.“I’ve seen them here when I start opening up at am.”Last year, the police launched a clampdown on the notorious spot.Coppers caught  kerb crawlers approaching prostitutes over a three-month period,  of them were then slapped with section  orders, banning them from the area.Councillor Daren Hale insists everything is being done to clampdown on the number of sex workers which “causes misery for residents.”Inspector Kirsty Tock, of the Hull central community policing team, said: “Hessle Road remains our main focus and, at the moment, we are tackling those seeking out sex workers.“We are continuing to carry out patrols and using the injunctions to prevent prostitution on Hull’s streets.“We have changed our approach recently and are using plain-clothes officers and now punters are feeling the full force of these section  orders.We are also using CCTV to collect further evidence."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000439038144-e1538602636221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"conservative party brexit unity rod liddle opinion","story":"I don’t think Theresa May is going to be on Strictly any time soon. Whoever convinced her it would be dead cool to walk on stage at the party conference and jig about to an Abba song needs a bit of invasive brain surgery, right now.It was like a remake of Re-Animator, or Night Of The Living Dead.There’s no point in Theresa trying to tell us she’s the le and soul of the party and actually a bloody good laugh.We know she isn’t. She’s about as charismatic as an underdone crumpet on a wet Sunday. But she doesn’t need to be Ginger Rogers. She’s the Prime Minister.And you have to give her credit for doggedly sticking to that role. EvenI’m not convinced she’s been doing it terribly well.But on Brexit — God, how mind-numbingly boring the whole thing is — she has a good point.I’m not a fan of her Chequers deal for us to leave the European Union. I think we’re giving too much away. I’d rather have a no-deal exit.But time is pressing. And I’m aware that while we Leavers won the referendum, the margin was comparatively small. So we ought to be gracious and accept a little bit of a compromise. Try to strike a respectable deal with those gangsters from insignicant countries.And a little further down the line, tweak the arrangements a little to suit us better. In the meantime, just strike the deal.And that means getting behind May and presenting a united front to Europe. Most of the Conservative MPs understand that, even the arch-Brexiteers like the excellent Michael Gove.But Bfo the Blundering Bear does not. I’m talking about Boris Johnson. Now he IS fun and good company. But he’s about as likely to become Prime Minister as I am to cop off with Emily Ratajkowski after a few pints and a quick meal at the Chicken Cottage.He has very little support among his political colleagues. He has a lot more among Conservative activists. But very little among voters north of Watford.And yet Bfo was at it again this week. Taking the p**s out of the Prime Minister. And making a rousing speech to his hardcore supporters. Demanding we tell the EU to stuff it.Well, there was a time when we should have told the EU to stuff it — two years ago when we first started negotiations.That time has passed. A lack of confidence from the Government and a ided party let us down.Now is the time to show a bit of unity and wring a deal out of the deathly bureaucrats. Maybe not the Chequers deal — May didn’t mention the word at all during her speech — but a version of it.Otherwise we’ll have a General Election on our hands. One the Tories will lose. And you’ll wake up to find John McDonnell is in charge of your finances and Diane Abbott is Home Secretary.Come on — surely that should concentrate the mind a little Hero of the week is Jane Lunnon, head of a girls’ school in South London.She has stuck the boot into “image-obsessed” reality TV – especially that coven of gurning and pouting imbeciles in Love Island, such as Megan Barton Hanson.Such programmes are “incredibly damaging” to young people, she reckons, calling them “trivial nonsense”.I think Jane is right. And the same goes for all those hyped-up talent shows where people with no talent – just a lust for fame – get judged on their appalling performances by people with no talent.Kids need to know the dference between fame for fame’s sake – and real achievement.Its horrible that Corine Remande has lost the sight in one eye after she was hit by a golf ball during the Ryder Cup.The poor woman was standing among spectators when Brooks Koepka’s tee shot hit her in the face.She’s now threatening legal action against the organisers. She says they didn’t give spectators enough protection.This is ludicrous. What were they supposed to do And what will happen is that in future crowds will be kept even further back from the action. Just because of one horrible accident.Wait until the same thing happens in cricket...The uni magazine said: “It was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping and whooping pose an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues. BSL clapping – or, jazz hands – would be a more inclusive form of expression.”With anxiety or sensory issues  What is wrong with these people They are “triggered” by almost everything.

It is dirty and unhygienic — a report out this week said it is a breeding ground for bugs.There is even a version of Monopoly with debit cards instead of notes. And last month we told you of the  century The Boot pub in Freston, Suffolk, the first boozer in the country to go cashless.This looming death has been around for a while. In August, the Bank of England said it was considering phasing out p and p coins. And ATMs are closing at a rate of  a month.Just  per cent of payments are cash, down from  per cent in . And those payments only account for three per cent in terms of the value of how much is spent.Paying on card has been on the rise ever since Barclaycard launched in , but cards too face being eclipsed by payments on mobile phones. Either way, both mean we need cash less. And that is not a bad thing, right Getting rid of cash would hit criminals and tax evaders hard as they do business in cash to make it harder for authorities to track the movement of money.Businesses would rejoice because they would not have to pay security guards to transport money and would not have to spend ages counting and bagging it.Some also reckon it is easier to keep a tab on finances when spending on cards or apps. You might forget buying that extra round at closing time in the pub, but your phone will always remember. And of course, you get consumer protection when using a credit card, along with reward points or cashback offers.Credit card firms make their money not just from interest payments but from taking a small fee for each transaction — so they offer us incentives to choose their cards. Use an Air Miles card and before long you could have a free flight to Paris or New York.More than a quarter of clothes in the UK are bought online — and you can’t use cash over the internet. As we move even more to buying online and via smartphone apps, cash will be needed less and less. Whether cash dies out in five years or  or  just depends on technology.But many are in no rush to see the back of it — and not just because of nostalgia for their old piggy banks. One consideration is: Can we entirely trust the banks to look after our money  Fraud is soaring as criminals take advantage of security issues around online banking. Banks blame customers but critics say banks need to take responsibility.We have featured victim after victim on The Sun Money columns, and they all say bank staff have turned their backs on them. There are millions of others who need cash simply because they rely on it to pay for things day to day. And it is the less well off or elderly who rely on it the most.Consumer magazine Which  — which has been campaigning against the loss of banks and ATMs — has produced research showing poorer families and older folk are hardest hit.Gareth Shaw of Which  said: “ATM and branch closures are threatening to leave behind the millions who still rely on cash. Our research highlights lower-income families and older generations will be among the worst hit.”In June, services from Visa, one of the three main card providers along with Mastercard and American Express, went down with technical issues — highlighting the risk of being solely reliable on cards and phones. “When the trolley came around on the train and the card payment wasn’t working, the only people who could eat were those with cash,” one banker explained.And what about hospitality workers  The Government has said all tips, evenon cards, must go to staff — but we all know some unscrupulous bosses will not do that. Like many, I prefer to give my tips in cash so I know the waiter or waitress gets it all.Charity collectors often have card machines now but collections for most churches, schools and small local good causes still rely on tins and the rattle of coins.Cash may well be dying out, but I still make sure I always keep some coins in my pocket just in case. And I have older relatives who still feel most comfortable with coins and notes.So until we have a population where everyone feels happy when using a card or phone, I will be rooting against a completely cashless Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Putin constructs himself as a strongman - think of all the bare chested photos.“It’s all part of the same projection. It’s designed to be cavalier, uncaring and robust.Rogers, a founding member of think tank the Henry Jackson Society, also branded the former KGB thug’s government “ugly and deranged”.He added: “His regime is so wild and unruly.“Putin’s government doesnt seem particularly bothered about what it does whether its the invasion of other countries or the lies and the misinformation that it spreads through out the world.”Michele Berdy, a Moscow language expert, told CNN that Putin’s speaks excellent Russian in a country where speaking properly is highly valued - meaning his use of curse words is “strategic.”She said: “Thats why Ive always thought that his slipping into this is very strategic.He decides when he wants to leave standard literary Russian and get into non-standard Russian.The Russian leader also uses threatening body language when meeting rivals.In July , Putin drew the social equivalent of a weapon when he pointed his finger at a “dominant Donald Trump at the G summit.Body language expert Judi James analysed the historic first handshake between the US President and the Moscow hard man.She said: “Hesuffered an underarm-patting from Trump that made him look like the dominant leader, so much so that Putin responded with a pointed finger, which is the body language equivalent of drawing a weapon.”In September , a then-Prime Minister Putin responded to a series of terrorists bombings in Russia by Chechen rebels.He said: “Were going to pursue the terrorists everywhere.That means, youll excuse me, well catch them in the toilet, well wipe them out in the sh*t house, finally.In , former KGB spy Vlad issued a disturbing threat to a French journalist who asked a hostile question at a summit in Brussels.Putin said: “Come to Moscow. We can offer you a circumcision.“I will recommend a doctor to carry out the operation in such a way nothing  will ever grow there again.When asked about Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane in  near the Syrian border, Putin suggested Ankara wanted to “lick the US in a certain place.”He said: “If anyone in the Turkish leadership decided to lick the Americans in a certain place - I dont knowthey acted correctly or not -- I dont know whether the Americans need that.According to reports, the Kremlin strongman was using a Russian expression which means to lick someone’s bum.In , when asked about his supposed wealth, he said: “Thats such garbage. They picked it out of their noses and smeared it on their papers.”When asked about his sex le in , Vlad said: Theyve asked me when I began having sex.I dont remember - I remember exactly when I did it the last time.

a stark message the EU Council chief warned time was running out fast to strike an agreement and the PM needed to “get down to business”.He said Britain should accept the bloc’s offer of an unprecedented trade and security pact, calling it a “true sign of respect”.His remarks were met with jubilation by eurosceptics including ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who said they proved the PM’s soft Brexit plan was now a dead duck.The Polish eurocrat told Mrs May she has just two weeks to seal an exit package after holding talks with Irish leader Leo Varadkar in Brussels yesterday.He said: “From the very beginning, the EU offer has been not just a Canada deal, but a Canada plus plus plus deal.“Much further-reaching on trade, on internal security and on foreign policy cooperation.“This is a true measure of respect.And this offer remains in place.The EU is serious about getting the best possible deal.”Mr Tusk said the EU needs to see “maximum progress” at a summit starting on October the two sides are to reach a deal.He added: “Now the Tory party conference is over we should get down to business.”A key stumbling bloc to a Canada-style deal is the requirement the UK accepts a backstop that carves Northern Ireland out of its customs and regulatory sphere.But senior eurosceptics still leapt on the EU chief’s remarks and warned Mrs May she will end up with no deal at allshe perseveres with Chequers.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said: “Tusk’s Canada plus plus plus offer shows there is a superb way forward that can solve the Irish border problem and deliver a free trade based partnership that works well for both sides of the Channel - as I set out last week in my plan for a better Brexit.”Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis added that it showed Downing Street was “wrong” to claim there is “no alternative to Chequers”.Referring to Mr Tusk, ex Ukip leader Nigel Farage implored the PM: “Please Mrs May, bite his hand off.”EU officials told The Sun that Mrs May will be given the chance to deliver a make-or-break pitch to leaders before they discuss Brexit over dinner.Speaking alongside the Council chief, Irish PM Leo Varadkar called for “a trading relationship with the UK after Brexit that’s as close as possible”.But just hours after his meeting with Mr Tusk the Irish PM appeared to pour cold water on the idea of a Canada-style trade deal.He said: “I don’t know what Canada plus plus plus means.It’s just a concept at this stage.He knows full well that we will not accept a deal which splits up the UK.And he also knows his comments yesterday make le more dficult for Mrs May — who he pretends to “respect”.And spare us the faux outrage about Jeremy Hunt’s comments. At least the Foreign Secretary is elected by voters, not bureaucrats.Tusk is a walking and talking reminder that we’re better off out. “There is a possibility that an agreement of that nature, which would be unique, will take more than the transition period to do.”Mr Varadkar also demanded that Britain comes up with a new backstop proposal “well in advance” of the next Council summit.And he dismissed a key possible compromise that Mrs May could offer to keep the whole of the UK in the customs union as a fallback option.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this could hamper Britains ability to do trade deals with other countries outside the bloc.Ireland and the UK are in a common travel area of passport-free movement.And as they are both in the EU single market, there is no restriction on goods and no tarfs.Leaders in London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels are keen to avoid a hard border after Brexit — when the UK has vowed to leave the single market and customs union.This would mean border checks being reintroduced to monitor movement between jurisdictions operating under the two dferent regulatory systems.There were fears this could have jeopardised the Good Friday Agreement peace deal.Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he could block Brexit talks unless the UK signed a formal agreement not to have a hard border.If this happened Ireland’s businesses could be left paying tarfs on imports and exports with its biggest single trading partner, Britain.Some had suggested moving border checks across the Irish Sea — but Unionists and Brexiteers rejected that, saying it undermines the integrity of the UK.Northern Ireland parties including representatives from Sinn Fein and Alliance will meet Mr Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt today for talks in Brussels, and the DUP and UUP will have similar talks next week.But no new checks will be accepted by Theresa Mays DUP allies, Nigel Dodds said today.Its important ... that there are no economic barriers put up, tarfs, checks or anything  between one part of the United Kingdom and the other.And Irish Foreign Minister Simon COveney said that any agreement cant rely on the devolved Government because they are not currently sitting.Any agreements that are made and signed off on are between the British government and the European Union and that will be a legal text of a treaty that has to be fully legally operable, whether or not there is devolved government in Northern Ireland, he said this morning.NOT delivering on the Brexit promised to the British people would be the greatest political risk to take.The International Trade Secretary insisted that we must leave on the th of March and admitted he thought it would be possible to get a changed deal later on.He told Bloomberg: Not to deliver Brexit is the greatest political risk we could run.We should try to get as much of a final deal as we can get by the th of March, but it’s self-evident thatit’s a bilateral treaty, it can be revised later on.Negotiations are at a crunch point, with less than six months to go until Britain formally quits the EU at the end of next March.On whether Theresa May has made too many concessions to Brussels, Mr Fox said: We all had our own reservations about it, but that is the collective decision.Whilst I may be very sympathetic with those who take an ideologically purist position, we are also politicians whose job is to be able to deliver.He said that Brexiteers looking to change our EU exit didnt get that Mrs May has no majority in the House of Commons.The PMs Chequers plan has been slammed by leavers and remainers alike, but she insists theres no other deal on the cards which would keen Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK together.We have no majority in the House of Commons -- and evenwe did, that doesn’t guarantee that we have got a Leaver majority. And the reality is that we will have to get any deal through the House of Commons in the end.TODAY: Talks between the EU negotiator Michel Barnier and Northern Ireland parties Sinn Fein and Alliance get underway in Brussels.MONDAY: Mr Barnier meets with DUP politicians over the Northern Irish border. British officials work on the wording of their new offer to avoid a hard border.OCTOBER: Theresa May attends an EU Council summit where a Brexit deal is hoped to be thrashed out. Officials are still working towards this deadline.NOVEMBER: If no deal is reached in October, an emergency summit has been pencilled in for a weeks later. Both sides say this is the last chance to secure an agreement.DECEMBER: The PM will take her deal back to MPs to vote on in the House of Commons. Its expected to be a vote between her deal and no deal at all, but some MPs want to force her to renegotiate, and others are demanding another referendum.MARCH: Britain formally leaves the European Union, anda deal is done, the -month transition period will begin. This morning the Irish European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee said the will was there between both sides and she was confident that new plans to deal with the thorny issue of the Irish border would soon be revealed.She told Radio s Today programme: We have less than two weeks before the next European Council meeting, whatever the deal is, should be brought forward to Michel Barnier so we have time to look at it.I have confidence on the basis I think the Prime Minister wants to reach agreement.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t emotional. It was planned,” Ryan tells The Sun.“He was writing drafts of his murder note at least a month before we decided to move out.“So we were sitting there with him as he was typing up a note about killing us.“I think he’d always had it in the back of his mind that he would kill us when we were no longer useful to him.”“He used to march around the house at night, he says. And that’s exactly what witnesses said he did before he shot himself. So at home he was clearly trying to work himself up.”Before the day of the murder, Lance didnt physically attack his family, but he did coercively control them - taking charge of every aspect of their lives.However, it was only after they lost their mum and sister that the brothers discovered this kind of non-violent domestic abuse is more likely to turn deadly than violent domestic abuse.“We thought he’d start hitting us and we’d know this is getting lethal,” says Luke.But that never happened.The brothers childhood was spent in the Cambridgeshire countryside, living under their fathers bizarre and oppressive tyranny.“We were poor. We grew our own food. We were almost like Russian peasants,” said Luke.Lance didn’t have any friends, except on forums online, and he didn’t want Claire to have any either.But she was naturally friendly and managed to make connections in the community.Unhappy that his we was defying his control, Lance moved his family to a small village outside Spalding in Lincolnshire so fast that nobody knew where they had gone, and his behaviour escalated.Claire started working in Morrisons but he made her hand over her wages, rationing them back to her.Meanwhile she’d look after the children and complete lists of chores he’d leave round the house for her, including filling up his car - that only he drove.The one time she had a friend around he sat in the neighbouring room listening.“If he could keep her busy she had no time to see other people or build a le,” says Luke.“It was part of his isolation strategy.”Ryan remembers arbitrary rules becoming a normal aspect of their lives.“We got the bus back from school, ing at . nearly on the dot every day. Dinner was ready at ..If we were late, which we always would be, we’d be shouted at.“He wanted to find ways to attack us - whether they were legitimate or not.”The brothers realise now that their father saw them as competition.“He only ever got involved in our lives to try to hinder us,” says Ryan. “He liked humiliating us.”So the boys learned to never express an opinion or question anything.They didn’t make friends - too scared for them to come around and face Lance - and spent all their time silently doing homework.“Our le was a prison. We never had an identity,” says Luke.They were also followed around the home by their dad.“In winter we didn’t have the heating on except in the living room to force everyone in there, says Ryan.“If we moved he would sneak around and follow us, adds Luke.He would break into the toilet sometimes just to keep an eye on us.”He’d even secretly stalk Claire to her work at Morrisons, spying on her to see who she was talking to.But bright Luke and Ryan figuredthey could ace their exams it would lead to earning good salaries: a means of escape for their mum and Charlotte.After getting straight A*s, Luke went to Warwick University, and Ryan Durham, and they worked as engineers after graduating.“Going to uni was the first time ever I’d been able to relax. I realised people were actually quite nice, says Ryan. “That’s when I started to think we could live a better le.”Five days before the murders, in a terrying two-hour window before their dad came back from work for his lunch, Luke and Ryan moved Claire out of the family home into a house theyd found.“We were on edge. We knew we had to get out by  and we just made it,” says Ryan.Claire left Lance lunch and a note saying she’d left and would email him later.They’d planned to meet on Monday to exchange documents so she wasn’t surprised to see him the car park of the leisure centre - but she didnt expect him to be holding a gun.“When he realised his control had gone that’s when he decided to kill us all,” says Luke.The brothers were both away when it happened, but remember the sickening sense of dread they felt when they turned on the news.They believe the only reason he didnt kill them too was because they were away, and Luke adds that he is unsure his dad ever loved them.“I think it’s impossible to love when you hate,” he says.“And I think he always wanted to die. I think really violent men inherently become very reckless and self-destructive.”In the months after the murders, Luke started writing to process his feelings, and has now published a book, Operation Lighthouse.Named after the police’s name for the case, the book is a rallying cry for society to act on domestic abuse - and they hope it will help people recognise the signs of coercive control.However, the brothers say the emphasis shouldn’t be on the woman escaping because this can be near-impossible.“The abuser takes financial resources away, isolates you from friends and family, takes your work away, destroys your esteem and then you have nothing, explains Luke.So how do you escape  You have literally nothing. That’s the problem.Their mum and sister couldnt have been more dferent to Lance.Claire,  when she was killed, cared about other people so deeply that she had learned sign language to speak to one customer who she saw for just a few minutes a week.Charlotte, meanwhile, used to spend her time volunteering with the elderly and disabled.“They were angels and our father was evil,” says Luke.A lot of families are plagued by these behaviours eventhey’re not lethal, he adds. They still ruin people’s lives.“So we’re trying to start a conversation and make as much noise as we can.”Operation Lighthouse: Reflections on our Familys Devastating Story of Coercive Control and Domestic Homicide is out now, independently published, Amazon £..Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t like taking out bricks.“Will the mortar chip out, or will the bricks crumble  Will the [honey] combs be usable once the bricks are out of the way  As much as I dreaded removing the bricks the final view of the hive was AWESOME!“The homeowner was more than pleased that we were able to remove and relocate the bees and their hive.”Incredible images and video footage helped the beekeeper identy where the bees may be living before proving it with an infrared picture and then starting to remove the bricks.As he removed more bricks he began to uncover a huge honeycomb beneath a window, which remained intact.After safely removing it, Glover pointed out the stain left behind by thousands of tiny bee feet walking on the white surface.He explained to Bored Panda: “Step-by-step the area of the home is opened, and all combs removed. Brood combs are rubber banded into hive frames and honey goes into a bucket .“If the homeowner is willing to eat a piece of comb with me, it’s probably never been sprayed. The bees who do not follow the combs into the new hive box are vacuumed into a two-stage vacuum. They are added back to the new hive once they are set up in their new yard.After the Bee Whisperer rescues bees, he uses them to repopulate empty hive boxes for local beekeepers who have suffered colony losses.He added: “No one is aware of the size of their honey bee hive. They are all surprised because they are expecting something the size of a wasp nest or hornet’s nest.“The infrared gives them the first clue, but that’s only the brood combs of the hive.The babies are incubated at . degrees Celsius. Any honey combs in the hive are cooler and usually don’t show on the IR.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000250345507.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"asshat douchebaggery and fam among 1400 new phrases added to oxford dictionary sparking controversy","story":"Other controversial additions, which were announced today, include douchebaggery, asshat, updation and Pooh-sticks.A surprising number of slang words have also made it into the dictionary - most notably the phrase bump and grind, which OED describes as a dancers erotic gyration of the hips.Among the slang words set to appear on the pages of the dictionary is butters, an adjective commonly used to describe someone or something as ugly.Another on the list is bum-suck, which is a colloquialism for a brown nose or suck up.

Heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles will be unaffected as his London home is at nearby Clarence House.Tim Knox, Director of the Royal Collection, said some of these items would go on public display at other palaces while  objects wouldto the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, George IVs bizarre seaside home on the south coast of England from where they were moved in  when that residence was sold.Buckingham Palace was built in  as a large private home and was only acquired by the monarch, King George III, in .The East Wing was part of an extension built in the reign of Queen Victoria.

trains is to increase profits, with the same number saying the Government is on side of the train companies and not passengers.Its time the Government and rail bosses stopped thinking about the bottom line and listened to voices of rail workers delivering on the front line.Rachael Maskell, shadow transport minister, said: The spike in crime on our railways, including a sharp rise in sexual

This restructuring was seen as a way for the company, which has a Dutch chairman and chief executive, to avoid such incidents in future because the Netherlands has tougher takeover laws than the City. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and a former Unilever employee, did his bit to smooth the way by promising to abolish a tax on idends that made holding the shares in the UK more attractive than in the Netherlands.One by one, the big battalions of City fund managers, many of whom prefer to speak on an anonymous basis to the financial press, broke cover to say what a dreadful idea this was: Colombia Threadneedle, Lindsell Train, Schroders, Aviva Investors, MG and Royal London all publicly stated their opposition. With Unilever needing the backing of % of UK investors to go ahead with the reorganisation, it was starting to look like a close-run thing.Yet that was not the only dficulty that emerged for the consumer goods giant.The influential Financial Times columnist Neil Collins, the most vocal critic of the move from the start, spotted in the small print of the particulars sent to investors that Unilever also required a simple majority of shareholders taking part in the vote for the motion to be passed.

Mr Juncker hoped October’s European Council summit would make “enough progress” that “we can see it through in November”. No deal would be “devastating”, he added. Mrs May was under mounting pressure tonight to bring forward plans to break the deadlock over the Northern Ireland border. Dublin’s Europe Minister Helen McEntee was confident a deal could be struck, but warned negotiations were reaching a “critical point”.

The Trussell Trust, which runs more than  foodbanks across the UK, said issues with benefits were the main reason for referrals to receive emergency food supplies. Waiting for the first payment and moving to the new system are blamed for causing hardship. It comes as as the Department for Work and Pensions finalises its plans for the next stage of the benefits shake-up to put before MPs later this month. Until now, only people making a new application for benefits in certain areas have been able to apply for Universal Credit.  This next stage - ‘managed migration’ - will see the three million people currently receiving tax credits or benefit payments under the old system sent a letter telling them to reapply for these payments under Universal Credit. Each person will have to wait at least five weeks for the first payment, andpeople miss the deadline for application, could face having all their payments stopped. Emma Revie, Chief Executive of the Trussell Trust said: “It doesn’t have to be like this. We know the problems people are likely to face as they move over to the new system, so we can learn from them.  The Department for Work and Pensions has shown they can act on evidence from the frontline to make a real dference to people who need our benefits system’s vital support. Now is the time for our Government to take responsibility for moving people currently on the old system over, and to ensure no one faces a gap in payments when that moves happens. Universal Credit needs to be ready for anyone who might need its help, and it needs to be ready before the next stage begins.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what happens next brexit theresa","story":"NewsWhat happens next with Brexit: Is Theresa Mays Chequers plan dead  Can a deal with the EU be reached and will there be another general election The Brexit negotiations reach their endgame in the next few weeks.

In the next few weeks the Brexit negotiations will reach their final stage.Can Theresa May strike a deal  And,so, what happens then The Prime Minister still has to reach a compromise with Brussels on her unloved Chequers plan .Then she has to present the deal to Parliament for MPs’ approval. The stakes could not be higher. Hundreds of thousands of jobs, our national security and economic well-being depend on what happens. Any  step by the Prime Minister and it could spell the end of her time in office. Here’s your guide to a crucial few weeks: What is the next stage   Britain and the EU will resume the Brexit negotiations next week after the stalemate at Salzburg.At the Austrian summit Mrs May’s Chequers plan was bluntly rejected as unworkable.The EU said it did not resolve the Irish border issue and her trade proposals gave Britain access to EU markets without having to abide by the rules on free movement of goods, people and services. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is expected to travel to Brussels on Monday to try to break the deadlock. On Wednesday  the President of the EU Jean-Claude Juncker is scheduled to make a declaration on the future trading relationship with the UK. Many believe he will offer the UK a Canada +++with a carve out on Northern Ireland. When will a decision be made   Mrs May will join EU leaders on Wednesday  for a working dinner on Brexit, migration and foreign policy. The following day will be the moment of truth. This is when we will discoverboth sides have found a way to resolve their dferences and have the basis for a potential agreement. If there a deal is in the offing then there will be another summit, pencilled in for November , to sign it off. How could the deadlock be broken   The simple answer is through a large amount of fudge and kicking the contentious issues into the long grass.Theresa May could agree to stick to EU rules on trade and goods to allow the UK to stay in a customs union after the transition period ends in .This would give us more time to bring in the technology needed to allow for frictionless trade across borders. But this would limit our ability to strike independent trade deals - the main prize in the eyes of the Brexiteers of our leaving. To resolve the Irish border question Britain could agree for Northern Ireland to have dferent regulations from the rest of the UK with the checks on goods taking place away from ports, borders and airports.This will require the agreement of the DUP which has been adamant there can be no border in the Irish Sea. Theresa May is expected to presents her plans to Parliament at the end of November or early December. MPs have been offered a meaningful vote on the final deal. What happens depends on who is best at counting. Labour has signalled it would vote down any deal unless it meets all six of its demands.The question for Jeremy Corbyn is what happensMrs May brings back a package which is within a whisker of passing his party’s six tests.The ultimate prize for the Labour leader is for Parliament to vote down Mrs May’s deal paving the way for a general election. But Mr Corbyn has to weigh up the cost of being seen to block what voters may regard as a sensible deal. If Labour does vote against the agreement the Prime Minister will have to rely on a handful of Labour Brexiteers to get it over the line.But they could be outweighed by the diehard Tory Brexiteers who have vowed to block Chequers including Jacob Rees-Mogg , Boris Johnson and Owen Paterson.There is also a risk that one or two Tory remainer MPs may side with Labour. Allies of Mrs May are still confident she can get a deal through Parliament. They believe that when forced to make a decision Tory Brexiteers would rather swallow the Prime Minister’s offering which they can unpick later than risk losing the prize of Brexit altogether. Tory remainers could also drop their objections rather than unleash the chaos which could lead to Jeremy Corbyn coming to power. What we do know is that when the vote comes the numbers will be nail-bitingly tight. What happensthe deal is voted down by Parliament   The short answer is nobody knows. Theresa May would be under immense pressure to resign. MPs would have to conjour up a motion that called on the Prime Minister to go back to the negotiating table.With time running out we would also have to ask for an extension of Article  which set the timetable for our departure.Extending Article  requires the unanimous approval of all  other EU states. They are likely to agree rather than allow the UK to crash out without a deal but we don’t know what price,any, they will demand for such a favour. The EU would have us over a barrel: the options would be the economically ruinous crashing out with no deal or bowing to Brussels in order to get an extension.

The boy and three friends had been able to easily gain access to a Tyne Yard railway depot, in Gateshead, which was a common haunt for youngsters. A company has now been found guilty of a safety breach after the schoolboy was set on fire and lost his legs and seven fingers following a rail yard electrocution. A jury found freight operator DB Cargo guilty of failing to protect people from risk, Chronicle Live reports.  A disused signal box known as the “haunted house” was a popular attraction to children at the site, near Birtley, and prosecutors said inadequate measures were in place to keep people off the premises. When two lads began climbing up a wagon, one of them got too close to the live overhead wire and suffered catastrophic injuries. During the trial at Newcastle Crown Court, prosecutor Gordon Menzies said the railway yard was a potentially hazardous area by nature but added: “It was made much more dangerous by the fact that in this yard, on the defendant’s land which it leased from Network Rail, there was a signal box which had not been used since . “It had a reputation among local children and was known as the haunted house. It was something of a lure to not just young children but older children as well.  “The prosecution say the dangers those children were exposed to arise because of the inadequacies of the defendant’s arrangements for keeping that site secure. “It was a hazardous area and was left insecure.” The court heard access to the yard, which is off the East Coast Mainline, could be gained by four bridges off Lamesley Road, near Birtley. Two of them had been safely fenced off but the third had a gate which did not lock properly, while a fourth did not have any gate to prevent pedestrian access, Mr Menzies said. On Saturday June  , two boys and two girls aged between  and , who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to the yard to go to the signal yard. DB Cargo had denied failing to ensure non-employees, including the four children, were not exposed to risk. Mr Menzies told jurors: “There was not a single fence or credible obstacle to prevent them getting to the haunted house and being exposed to the risks that were involved.Mums terror of dragging her children out of bed after home was set on fire in arson attack“There was no security patrol present, there weren’t even any warning signs on the bridge to provide even that minimal level of deterrent. “The prosecution say this was an obvious trespassing route.” After spending time in the signal box, the children began to explore the yard and played on large piles of rubble. The two boys started to climb up a railway wagon in the sidings and one reached the top but suffered an electric shock after getting too close to the overhead cables. It is not necessary to even touch them in order to get an electric shock, jurors heard. His -year-old friend behind him also suffered an electric shock and was thrown to the ground but escaped with minor injuries. Mr Menzies said: “The children described a loud bang andwas thrown to the ground. “ was set on fire and fell to the ground. “He suffered le-changing injuries, including the amputation of both of his legs, one above he knee, one below, and all the fingers and thumb on his right hand, and on his left hand two fingers and part of his left hand itself.”  Prosecutors said DB Cargo did not do enough to ensure people were not exposed to risk. One of the youngsters said for a time she would go there every day and prosecutors say the signal box was a “den”, which the company denies. DB Cargo had arranged security patrols of the signal box but only at night on weekdays, the court heard. It also put up warning signs but pictures showed these had been ripped off. Its own risk assessments showed it was a high risk environment, the court heard. Referring to the children going to the sidings, Mr Menzies said: “There was nothing to stop them, no security guards, none of the staff stopped them, there’s no CCTV in that area. “They were able to roam about half a mile from where they entered the site.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains favourite comfort foods revealed","story":"NewsBritains favourite comfort foods revealed including curry and lasagneAverage Brit will turn to comfort food nine times a monthShareCommentsByRob Knight:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsCurry is among the nations top comfort food dishes\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCurry, Chinese and cottage pie are among the nation’s favourite comfort foods, it has been revealed.

Bev Mitchell, trading director for Iceland, said: “Our research has shown that as the cold weather approaches, people are turning to comfort foods and seven in  people admitted that their favourite comfort foods often aren’t the healthiest choices. “However, it is possible to enjoy lots of our autumnal favourites in a healthier way thanks to our Slimming World range.” When it comes to sweet or savoury, four in  tend to opt for the latter with just  per cent going for sweeter dishes.

Depraved Duarte Xavier, , trawled lonely hearts sites masquerading as Ana, chatting to scores of straight men and sending them saucy photos. When they agreed to meet up, Ana set a series of conditions they had to abide by, including a stipulation that they wear a blindfold throughout the liaison. Xaviers first victim, a -year-old man, agreed to a hook up at Anas flat on February   and agreed to cover his eyes in the bedroom. He realised something was wrong when they began having sex and was horried when he whipped off the blindfold and saw Xavier.  The enraged victim stormed out and later received a text from Xavier reading: I got a mental health problem, sorry. On October  , a -year-old man messaged Ana, who told him she was a recently single female looking for a bit of fun. The pair traded flirty messages over WhatsApp and the oblivious victim arranged to meet for sex in a Wandsworth flat hours after they chatted in a video call. When he arrived he heard what he thought was a female voice saying: Stay there, dont take off and dont move the mask. Someone then crept up behind him and pulled the blindfold tighter, Kingston Crown Court heard. He was led into another room where Ana began performing a sex act but the brief encounter ended with disgust when he too removed the face covering. Xavier sent a series of messages to his victim pleading a misunderstanding but continued to pester him for oral sex.  That victim reported the incident to police and Xavier was arrested on October   on suspicion of causing sexual activity with a person without consent. But he was released under investigation. A number of mobile phones and masks were also seized. The third incident took place on April  this year when -year-old Ana lured another man to her darkened flat where she claimed to be concealing her identity so as not to tip off her husband to the fact she was having an affair. As the victim went upstairs, he felt a person grab him and pull his trousers down and throw a pillow case over his head. He asked for confirmation the person he had been talking to was really a woman but Ana told him no and began performing a sex act. But the suspicious date used his phone torch to check and was so horried he marched straight out to call the police.  Xavier was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and later charged with two counts of causing a male aged  or over in a penetrative sexual activity and sexual assault. He was remanded and later bailed at Wimbledon Magistrates Court.His fourth victim was only identied by police after reviewing phone records from seized mobile phones. The -year-old had been too humiliated to tell anyone of the encounter. Following their introduction in December , Ana explained that she was looking for a role play experience where the victim would be blindfolded. Both parties exchanged pictures and videos and agreed to meet at Anas address before she claimed her landlady would be home and they must meet where. Ana told the victim they would meet in King Georges Park, in Wandsworth, at around pm on December . Despite chatting in a video call and phoning to check he was heading the right way, the man had no reason to suspect Ana was actually a man.  He went to the agreed spot, a secluded area, when Ana arrived and performed a sexual act on him before they had sex. Ana then left and the victim remained entirely unaware he had just had sex with Xavier. WhatsApp records of conversations between the pair revealed that the victim had not realised what had happened and at no point did Xavier reveal his true identity. As a result, the pair arranged to meet again a few days later, on the same terms and same place. This time the victim held off on putting on the blindfold, curious as to who he was meeting. As Xavier approached, the pair saw each other and Xavier tried to hide. When the victim asked what he was doing, Xavier claimed to have believed that the victim was bisexual and approved of the arrangement. Xavier offered to pay his cab fare home, to which the victim said no and that he did not want to be contacted by him ever again. The defendant, of Wandsworth, of south London, was convicted of six counts of causing a male aged  or over to engage in penetrative sexual activity.

The reason behind this occurrence is certain berries we have in our area have fermented earlier than usual due to an early frost, which is turn has expedited the fermenting process. Many birds have not migrated south, so it appears to be more prevalent than in past years. It appears that some birds are getting more tipsy than normal.  And it added that younger birds are the most likely to be affected by toxins. The Facebook message said: There is no need to call law enforcement about these birds as they should sober up within a short period of time.

Stephen Halliday, , was hacked to death with a machete - suffering fatal head and neck wounds - in the Dominican Republic on September . The retired estate agent, originally from Maidenhead, Berkshire, was killed at the home he was nearly finished building in the resort town of Las Terrenas. Mr Hallidays devastated family have launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay for a legal fund to fight for justice on his behalf after three men were arrested.  His son Geoff Halliday, who lives in Los Angeles, set up the GoFundMe page to pay for a legal team, bereavement counselling and other costs. It has raised more than pound, so far. Mr Halliday’s grief-stricken widow Angela said: “My sweet, sweet husband, totally dedicated and unconditional father was robbed from our lives in a senseless and torturous way that he never deserved. I will not give up in having him honoured in the way he merits, by making certain that these predators never see the light of day and that my husband’s legacy will become not this horric act but something greater as was he.” The family have previously told how Mr Halliday was attacked in bed while he was home alone at night, and the suspects were arrested after the Hallidays played CCTV footage from inside the house for police.  One of the suspects is said to be a -year-old neighbour who Mr Halliday had rowed with just weeks earlier over an alleged theft of generator batteries. His devastated son Geoff Halliday wrote on the fundraising page: My father was murdered, on September th, , leaving our family completely devastated, shattered and bewildered. We are desperately seeking help in establishing a legal fund to fight for justice for my father and rebuilding a le for my mother. “Anybody who knew him is already aware of the joyfulness and love he demonstrated and the le he lived in service of our family. He worshipped my mother completely and showered her with a level of affection I could never fathom.

Raunchy antics are often ignored by club owners and staff, mostly thanks to the citys open-minded attitudes to sex and drug use. One legendary institution, the KitKatClub, is famous for openly encouraging guests to perform sex acts while on the dancefloor. The techno club hit the news today after one guest picked up bacterial meningitis at the venue last Saturday, sparking a city-wide alert which asked guests to visit doctors for tests. Like Berghain and neighbouring Panorama Bar, these clubs have staunchly refused to clean up their acts despite growing in popularity. Speaking anonymously, one Londoner lted the lid on what really goes on in the sex-obsessed bar after visiting with friends.  The -year-old told : Wed never been to Berlin before so me and a couple mates booked our trip in January through a travel website. One of my friends had heard about the club so we decided we wanted to check it out.After a day of sightseeing, the three lads made their way to the club from their hotel. Following a -minute journey, they arrived at KitKatClub, located in a former industrial section of central Berlin. They knocked on the door which was partially opened by a woman who looked them up and down before they went in. They were initially turned away by staff because the club only admits patrons who wear fetish or bondage gear.  At first we nearly didnt get in because we were wearing normal clothes, he said. But we had the idea of taking our tops off and the guys at the door let us straight in. The man says he couldnt believe his eyes when he stepped through the doors. They were confronted by a small group of clubgoers wearing a iety of outlandish leather clothing. As soon as I got in, the first thing I saw was an overweight middle-aged man being led by young women across the nightclub, he said. We sat down on a sofa where we were given body paint to use all over our body. While we were sitting down a man in a gimp mask approached us. He put his hands down my friends pants, which he wasnt too happy about.

Lothario Chatupoom Losiri posted pictures of several young woman sleeping naked on his bed on Facebook , claiming they had spent the night together. The -year-old also claimed to have bedded a young Russian woman he met outside a grocery store. But furious locals have voiced their fury at his antics, calling for him to be evicted and prompting police to search his home in the Full Moon Party island of Koh Phangan. Despite claims that he lacked decency after his online bragging, no evidence of any wrongdoing was uncovered in the search. Chatupoom calls himself the Thai Caveman - a persona he uses to pick up women.  After posting a picture of a group naked women sleeping, he wrote that he was very tired from the previous evening but still woke up to drink coffee and meditate while they slept. The cavemans antics sparked outrage from locals who accused him of showing a lack of decency after dozens more images emerged of women he had taken back to his cave. Police arrived at the cave, a former tin mine, yesterday and searched for anything suspicious but found nothing. They admitted that Chatupoom had not broken the law but said they would monitor the situation.  Koh Phangan Sherf Kairik Kraisong said: Officials on Koh Phangan have investigated the situation and performed a background check on the person, who was originally domiciled in Bangkok. He graduated with a degree from Silpakorn University. Koh Phangan district has made an inquiry to the landowner whether he will continue to let Mr Chatupoom live in the area or ask him to leave. Now there are no complaints. If there is a complaint, the officers can take legal action. This situation is precarious and risky, so I sent the staff to check and talk with Mr Chatupoom. Speaking to reporters, Chatupoom denied that he had done anything wrong and said that all of the women who visited his cave were there of their own choice.  He said: I came to Koh Phangan to play music but shortly after the band broke up. Now I earn a living by painting art and selling it to tourists. The women who sleep here, there is no compulsion in any way. None of the women are forced to do anything, and sometimes we dont have sex. Sometimes we just hug until morning. They are all happy and Im happy, too.

Matthew and Candise Raison, from Australia, were on holiday in Bali along with his sister Tamzin when they decided to get a relaxing massage. They opted for a go jek massage where the masseur comes to you as the ultimate holiday treat. But Matthew didnt know what the masseur meant when he askedhe wanted him to get the red dragon out of him.  Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Candise said her husband thought the masseur was trying some prayer thing. She told him: I dont know what youre saying but my husband will try anything, go for it! However, they soon found out what the masseur really meant as he started to carve into Matthews back with a coin. The massage is called Gua sha which is an Asian medical practice where the side of a coin is rubbed in parallel stripes on the chest and back. Its often referred to as scraping or coining and is believed to release unhealthy body matter from sore, tired, or injured muscles and stimulate new, oxygenated blood flow.  The red marks ran from the top of his neck all the way down to his tailbone. Despite looking like he had been hurt with the red raised marks covering his back, Matthew and Candise saw the funny side. Its fair to say we were all in tears of laughter, she said. Despite the unsightly appearance, the massage brought Matthew some relief from his chronic back pain. Candise said her husband, who works on power lines, has had a sore back for almost three years.

I can’t remember getting beaten like this.“At half-time there was a lot of emotion, we were trying to get things straight and after the game we’re angry but what can you say  We need to look at ourselves.“It’s easy to look at others and pass the blame on but there is no use in doing that.“We need to stick together.“You always have to be confident, it’s stupid as a football player to think you can’t turn it around. You have to stay positive.“Even though it’s hard to take we have to take it on the chin and go again this weekend.”The -year-old was at a loss to explain what went wrong on Saturday as a Billy Mckay hat-trick and goals from Sean Kelly and Joshua Mullin did the damage for a United side that could only muster one of their own through Pavol Safranko on  minutes.What Frans did accept though, was they need to improvethey want to get the better of the likes of Ross County and others now above them in the race for the Championship title.The Terrors lie in fourth, five points behind leaders Ayr and Frans feels they can learn a thing or two from their promotion rivals.“Sometimes it’s hard to explain in football, you get so much confidence and then this happens. It comes from nowhere,” he added.“I think we started really well. We had a great chance at the beginning and, obviously, we miss it. We concede a stupid goal on a set-piece where we need to be smarter.“We get back into the game with a great goal and, in that moment, I thought we were OK but again we concede a stupid goal again with a cross from the side.“Even then at - it’s bad but I thought ‘look we’ve got  minutes to turn it round’ and then we concede quite early.“The red card for Stewart Murdoch finished it. It’s easy to blame it on mentality but with the goals we conceded it’s about quality as well.“It’s about being smart. That’s what theydid better on Saturday, they were more dirty, more street-wise and we’re too nice.“I can’t blame boys, especially during the week in training, for effort because we train really hard butyou see the game on Saturday it’s logical for the first thing people question to be mentality.“You can run as much as you want butyou don’t do the basics and take a hold of the ball,you don’t pick up your man, simple things like that you’ll lose the game.”Frans apologised to fans, saying: “There’s not much we can say to the supporters, just sorry.

Job losses nationally are said to be in the region of  after Homebase entered into a company voluntary arrangement following \"under-performance of the business\".The applicant outlines that there is no demand for the store to be re-let as a single unit and iding the unit into two would help avoid the potential for a long-term vacancy.It is thought splitting the space would make it more appealing to potential tenants.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said: \"If iding the unit into two makes it more attractive then that is a good move to make.\"I believe one of the occupiers is likely to be another DIY store but I do not know what the other store would be.\"The main problem for the retail park has been the increase in online shopping. This has been the same problem for retailers in the city centre.\"In light of a \"city first policy\" which encourages businesses to establish themselves in the city centre rather than out-of-town locations, Mr Mackay does not believe this will give the retail park an unfair advantage over more central stores.He said: \"More needs to be done about the problem of online shopping on retailers. For a store like Homebase people were likely to drive there to get whatever they needed.\"The applicant suggested that despite the \"centre first\" policy this move would not be a problem because no new floor space is being created.The existing floor space would simply be split into two separate retail units.Mr Mackay said: \"It is not the type of store you would be likely to find in the city centre. I would be surprisedthe council were to reject this application.\"Mike Smith, manager of the Inverness Business Improvement District , does not support the proposal.\"In my personal opinion I do not think the plan should go ahead,\" he said.\"One of the restrictions of the retail park was that there were only to be single units in section  of the Town and Country Planning Act. To ide the unit into two is going against what has already been established.\"This is my opinion within my role as manager and not that of Bid. I would consider submitting a formal objection to the Highland Council but I would first establish the wider views of Bid before deciding the most appropriate action to take.\"Providing the planning application is accepted, the two new retailers would still occupy a considerably large space.The applicant recognises that the potential new occupiers would still have a larger floor space than the other existing retail units nearby.The proposal suggests that a long-term vacancy would have a negative impact on the \"vitality and viability of the commercial centre.\"Chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce Stewart Nicol agreed that iding the unit into two would be a wise move.He said: \"I think it would be a sensible and pragmatic approach to take.\"Friday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117814.jpg","title":"Time to tap into healthier lifestyle","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointSCOTTISH Water has announced plans to roll out tap water refill points around Scotland over the next two years.Councils are being consulted to identy the best locations with the aim of having the first  Top Up Taps installed by the end of next March.The move follows the launch earlier this year of the Your Water, Your Le campaign in which the utility giant called for customers to drink tap water at home, at work and on the move as a way of reducing waste, saving themselves money and staying hydrated.Edinburgh will be the first location for a Top Up Tap with the installation going in by the end of this month outside the front of the Scottish Parliament.Other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Inverness and Fort William.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable the company to digitally track water usage at each Top Up point.The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: \"Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotlands tap water ndash now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.\"A national drive to encourage people to stay hydrated by drinking water from the tap in refillable bottles was set out in the Scottish Governments Programme for Government -.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net. And the Pipistrelles bat even received some special treatment of a cosy box and a well deserved drink before the Bat Society team popped along to get the animal back to Gotham City.

Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”.

announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than continue with repairs to Galafoot over the festive period and into the new year, Amey has opted to finish on November  andthree months later.Mr Wallace added: ldquoThe local community has shown

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

It was an exciting experience but I was also really nervous.\"I did have to tell one or two of the speakers that their time was up and they needed to finish talking and I was really nervous to do that because I didnt want to come out sounding rude, but I think I got away with it.\"Why am I doing this  I want children to understand their rights and know all their rights so they can stand up for themselves.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-hearing-told-substation-could-jeopardise-hundreds-of-jobs","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Limitedwants to bring energy from their offshore windfarm onto land via a substation on the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station.But the local authority and community councils claim the substation should be sited at a less prominent site, where it could be hidden.They say putting the substation on the coastal site will hamper their ability to market the surrounding land which has the potential to create more than , jobs.The planning application for the substation was called in by Scottish Ministers in March this year ndash a month after East Lothian Council bought the land from ScottishPower.Housing and Planning Minister Kevin Stewart was in Cockenzie to open new affordable housing built next to the former power station site, as a public hearing was being held less than a mile away into the ICOL proposal.He called in the planning application in March this year as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China where she met representatives from ICOLrsquos parent company Red Rock.The Scottish Government appointed Reporter Allison Coard called the hearing so she could hear arguments from both side.ICOL said it believed that under current Government policy, which safeguards the site for energy use , their proposal was the ldquo best use of the land.However Ray Montgomery, who has been appointed as project manager for the Cockenzie site by the local authority, branded their claim ldquoridiculous.Mr Montgomery, who was head of infrastructure at the council, told the Reporter the land had potential for huge economic development in the area and the coastal location ICOL wanted to use was the ldquojewel in its crown.He told Ms Coard: ldquoI am concerned thatthis goes through the scale of the development is not compatible with our efforts to bring forward greater employment on that site.ldquoIt is ridiculous to suggest that a power station which employed  people and generated poundmillion a year being replaced with a substation which will employ seven people is best use of the land.A vision for the future of the site was produced on behalf of the council last year after  months of consultations with the local communities.The Cockenzie Masterplan foresees , jobs being created on the former power station site and surrounding landit is developed as it proposes.Ambitious proposals have also been put forward by Prestonpans Community Council for a cruise terminal at the coastal part of the site, while Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council want a marina developed on it.ICOL, which was represented by solicitor Robin Hutchison from international law firm Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang, Simon Herriott from Savills, as well as members of the windfarm team, dismissed the proposals put forward by communities for the site as ldquotheoretical.They insisted their substation was the lsquoonlyrsquo project on the table for the site, urging the Reporter not to consider either community council idea.Mr Hutchison told the Reporter: ldquoThe point to take away is that there is no evidence of alternative uses for the site.East Lothian Council and the community councils argue that an alternative site on a less prominent part of the site away from the shore would be better.The local authority argues that ldquobest use of the land would not be served by building the substation on the coastal site, which is seen as a prime attraction for marketing the enire area to future investors.ICOL has confirmed the substation, once built, would only require two employees to visit a few times a year for maintenance.A revised drawing of how it would look on the site which showed the space used reduced sparked anger from community councillor Brian Hickman, representing Cockenzie and Port Seton.He pointed out it was completely dferent to a revised drawing shown to his community council last month which promised something ldquomuch smaller when they were told the land needed would be lsquoshrunkrsquo from  hectares to  hectares.Mr Hickman told the hearing: ldquoI have lost confidence in this application because, in many respects, I do not think you know what you are doing or trying to achieve.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said the local community needed jobs.He said: ldquoWe do not have a lot of local employment and that is what we need. The Master Plan talks about , jobs being created. In our view, putting this substation on the foreshore will detract from the possibility to fully develop the site.The Reporter will now consider they representations before making a decision on the next stage of her investigation.Local ward Councillor Lachlan Bruce praised the community council representatives for their presentations to the Reporter.He added: ldquoI was very disappointed by the applicantrsquos dismissive views on what has been suggested for by the local communities for the site.ldquoLots of ideas have been put forward that would create jobs and opportunities on the site and they should be given all due considerations and not just knocked to the wayside so that they can build their big shed that will create no real employment opportunities for the local area.ldquoIrsquom still confident that the Reporter will find that this isnrsquot the best location of substation at Cockenzie and I can only hope that Scottish Government Ministers will make the best decision for the people of East Lothian which is for rejection of this application, I have my doubts that they will."},{"url":null,"title":"our-community-kitchen-tackling-social-isolation-in-haddington","story":"Our Community Kitchen was formed earlier this year as an intergenerational project, which was developed by Dementia Friendly East Lothian.The group was awarded funds from The Big Lottery, with the project, which meets each Tuesday at Haddington Bowling Club, on the townrsquos Wemyss Place, now looking to branch out to become its own organisation.Elaine Gale, from the project, said: ldquoOur Community Kitchen has been incredibly popular since beginning at the bowling club in February this year.ldquoWe have been offered a home within the club including full use of kitchen facilities plus a large area for dining.ldquoWe have developed a wonderful relationship with the committee at the club who are supportive and committed to Our Community Kitchen sharing the space with them.The kitchen currently operates each Tuesday from .pm and plans to expand to three or four days each week from January.Donations of homemade bread, napkins and juice have been made to the group, as well as fruit, which has been turned into jam and pies.Haddingtons community council has helped out, with pound, split between plans toserve a Christmas meal and to purchase a new oven at the bowling club.The group has also been supported by Haddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership .Funding was awarded to enable the group to continue into the New Year.Craig McLachlan, the area partnership chairman, said: ldquoHaddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership are focused on addressing inequalities and poverties across our area and these ambitions are being addressed through the work of our area plan.ldquoOne of the main inequalities that we are seeking to address is around social isolation.ldquoOur area has a growing elderly population, where one in five residents is currently aged  and over and, in addition, there are many new houses being built in and around the town so we need to find ways to help these new residents become involved in, and part of, our community.ldquoOur Community Kitchen are doing excellent work to address this, and other inequalities.ldquoHaddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership are therefore delighted to give them our full support."},{"url":null,"title":"leuchie-houses-retiring-ceo-mairi-okeefe-praised-by-politicians","story":"Mrs OrsquoKeefe will stand down from the helm of the national respite centre next month, south of North Berwick,  years after she took on the role.And Iain Gray MSP and his Westminster counterpart Martin Whitfield MP have both praised her work.Mr Gray, East Lothianrsquos representative at Holyrood since , told the Courier: ldquoIt has been a great pleasure to work with Mairi at Leuchie House over the last few years.ldquoFrom campaigning to save Leuchie from closure to securing signicant funding to keep it going, she has been the driving force behind the unique facilityrsquos success.ldquoMairi and her team have also helped put North Berwick and East Lothian on the map, with many hundreds of people from across Scotland and beyond remembering it fondly for the warm welcome and superb care and hospitality they enjoy at Leuchie.ldquoI know that Mairirsquos retirement as CEO will not mean the end of her involvement at Leuchie, but she will certainly be a very hard act to follow and I wish her all the very best for the future.And Mr Whitfield praised Mrs OrsquoKeefe for her ldquopassion, knowledge and commitment to Leuchiersquos success.He told the Courier: ldquoWhat she and her team have achieved in establishing Leuchie as a very well thought of independent charity is remarkable and she fully deserves all of the praise and plaudits she has received over the years.

To tell women that the notion of them being the equal of male physicists is the consequence of ldquocultural Marxism and indoctrination is startlingly aggressive. This was no accidental slip off the straight and narrow path of political correctness. Strumiarsquos remarks were incendiary, intentionally so the response of someone at the end of his rope, knowing he would swing for it.Nor, in the ensuing stramashhas he been remotely apologetic. Suspended from Cern, the European Organization for Nuclear Research where he works, the -year-old lecturer from the University of Pisa took his punishment as further evidence of the fundamental problem.It is his contention that the world of physics is becoming sexist against men, and that women are being promoted to positions ahead of better qualied males. Of his suspension he said: ldquoThis is what happens every time somebody wants to speak about this. All these people have been destroyed. Now, it could be that in some places there has been positive discrimination in appointing women. Given their near invisibility in the higher echelons of science for much of the last century, this might have been deemed necessary, not only to show that women were eminently capable of doing the job but also pour encourager les autres.If that is or has ever been the case, it is obviously a far from perfect solution to a historic imbalance. Yet as the importance of gender equality is finally being recognised across all professions and spheres ndash as is the need to eliminate discrimination of any sort ndash there are situations where employers must work harder to ensure eligible candidates are encouraged to apply.If a female applicant for a physicistrsquos vacancy has a less impressive CV than a man, it might be worth taking into account the insidious, age-long institutional or societal prejudices that explain that discrepancy. Rather than perpetuate the vicious cycle by pushing women always to the margins, a few judicious appointments could help adjust the scales.Is this what has motivated Strumiarsquos torrent of disdain  Possibly. He certainly believes men are being sidelined. Yet, since he holds a personal grievance over having once been beaten to a post by a woman, it suggests his rage comes less from rigorous assessment of the employment record in his specialism, and more from pique, a piece of grit that has produced a gallstone, not a pearl. You can picture him since that blow to his pride, nursing his wrath until finally this week it exploded into flame.There are so many disturbing elements to Strumiarsquos outburst itrsquos hard to know where to begin. The fervour with which he spoke is clearly the product of fury, of one who feels under threat. His language is like that of white supremacists who believe black brains are dferent, and thus inherently inferior to white. Or of fascists and sectarians who look down on those of other ethnicities and beliefs as lesser beings.Even more shocking, though, is that this denouncement of his fellow physicists comes at a time when we thought the battle had long since been won. Women and science is one of the oldest zones of conflict in the gender wars. It took centuries for us to be allowed to study medicine, let alone physics, and even then outstanding doctors like Elsie Inglis were sometimes treated by their superiors asthey were hospital porters rather than highly qualied surgeons. Today, the relatively low number of women in top medical roles reinforces the impression that discrimination in this arena persists.That is the most unsettling aspect of Strumiarsquos anger. His comments suggest that acceptance of women in science is far from universal. Despite swt reprisals by Cern, and widespread condemnation among the physics community, his words hint at pockets of resistance and denial.

In the early s Coronation Street commanded  million who watched Ena, Martha and Minnie snuggle up in The Snug to bitch about the ldquotart that was Elsie Tanner and her artful dodger son Denis.The Street worked because it was real, with entirely believable characters, as did subsequent event television such as Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, and Boys from The Blackstuff.But then we found other things to do. Fishing. Zumba. Cinema. But then cinema began catering for -year-olds who crave films in which all the characters wear tights.Now, wersquore back to television, and itrsquos not just because wersquore relatively skint Boris Johnsonrsquos ego. Itrsquos because TV drama has become powerful again. Eleven million of us couldnrsquot go to work last month without debating whether Keeley Hawesrsquo character in Bodyguard had been stfed . And there isnrsquot a newspaper which has not puffed BBC rsquos follow-up drama, The Cry.Poldark pulls in a healthy seven million, and Broadchurch a very decent m, . But why  Thanks to HBO and Netflix and Amazon raising the bar, content is king. Thanks to Breaking Bad and House of Cards we demand drama that reflects the world around us ndash yet is one step removed from reality.Yes, we havenrsquot yet created The Wire or The Sopranos but McMafia at least reflected London as the virtual Russian state it is, where free range oligarchs play Monopoly and have enemies dropped from balconies onto spiked railings or suffocated in zipped up bags. A Very English Scandal, however, about the Thorpe affair, was wonderful, a historical tale of political loyalty ndash but so redolent of the fickleness of modern day politics: Trump- Kavanaugh  Salmond-Sturgeon And allegory, thankfully, is back with a vengeance. The Prisoner once tapped into the counter-culture rebellion of the late s. The Fugitive reflected the American issues of freedom and movement, in an existential framework.Now television is repositioning the dark themes of the day. In recent years, Dexter was an allegory for the crime and punishment debate. Right now, cult drama Killing Eve offers a subtext for relationships between women sometimes compelled to be together, yet in competition, one hoping to emulate the other ndash yet just maybe love to have the other offed. A wee hint of Theresa May and Penny Mordaunt, perhaps Meanwhile, big TV hits such as ITVrsquos Strangers and BBCrsquos Keeping Faith ask how we psychologically profile our partner. They question marriage can we really know the person we pledge our troth to  Television is adding great layers. Doctor Who offers a perfect  for gender fluidity, while Sherlock investigates mental health issues, of OCD, and drug abuse.Yes, you may argue that Dr Foster was a load of old tosh, and it was. Yet it still pulled in nearly nine million, its success predicated on the womenrsquos movement ethos ndash a strong, powerful, educated female rails against the abusive louse of a husband when he leaves her for younger gorgeousness. Yet, the same writer Mike Bartlettrsquos BBC drama Press is tight, reflective and and extremely well acted.Thatrsquos not to say some of the allegory we watch doesnrsquot irritate the eyes worse than a rogue midgie when yoursquore out on your bike. Picnic At Hanging Rock was an attempt to symbolise the power of modern female sexuality ndash but was as convincing as a teacherrsquos attempt to argue algebra will one day be useful.Vanity Fair was poor, despite aspirations to present modern-day dilemma in a th century context should I have sex with him even though I donrsquot fancy him, but he drives a Ferrari  At least both were trying to be socially relevant.Now, you may claim that drama can attract decent figures without clever allegorical intent, such as soaps. Butwe take BBC Scotlandrsquos River City as an example itrsquos clear the storyliners donrsquot simply nick story ideas out of the papers these days.Shellsuit Bobrsquos inability to produce a child was clearly a comment about the growing emasculation of men. Gangster Lenny Murdoch undoubtably represents the uncontained control and power of Google and Amazon.OK, maybe thatrsquos stretching the argument a little. But that doesnrsquot mean the arrival of the new Line of Duty wonrsquot be more anticipated than the arrival of the first grandchild.

This partnership is more about the DWP offloading the responsibility of the department to support those in need to access the benefits they are entitled to, and less about the real effort to better understand and reform the system.Universal Credit, which combines a number of historic benefits into one payment, has been criticised for making claimants wait up to six weeks to receive any help, for the widespread use of financial sanctions against claimants and for leaving many families worse off.Alan McIntosh, an independent blogger on debt said Citizen Advice and Citizen Advice Scotland had misjudged the issue, and allowed themselves to be used as a \"kevlar vest\" by work and pensions minister Ester McVey.\"They have previously criticised the roll out of Universal Credit and called it disastrous. It now appears they are going into a partnership with the DWP to assist in that roll out.

There is nothing abstract about that mandate. Itrsquos a very concrete mandate, and I think it should be used, and I think the opportunity and the time is coming very soon.Mr Salmond asked Ms Marwick why she thought Yes marches were bigger in Scotland ldquowhen we donrsquot have an independence process than they were in .Ms Marwick said: ldquoI think there is a desire for the process of independence to be moved forward by many people.ldquoI think they see that is a way of putting pressure on everybody involved, to say, lsquoThere is a case for this, you want it, we need to move quicker.ldquoThe ultimate decision is going to be... is it going to be just after Brexit  Is it going to be afterwards  Because of course there is also a political mandate for it.Ending the show, Mr Salmondrsquos co-presenter, former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, also spoke of the Yes movementrsquos urgent desire for another referendum.She said: ldquoThe debate in the SNP is concentrated on how quickly to push forward on another independence referendum.

After a lot of people thought this a ridiculous idea, a government spokesman declared they would be classed as part of a main meal, and thus exempt from the proposals.Perhaps the supposed health impact of fatty, salty or sugary foods is immediately nullied when they are classed as an intrinsic part of a meal, while they are stuffed full of calories and poison when wolfed down as a snack before the main event. Or perhaps the Government is making it up as it goes along, and performing an instant U-turn when people point out that its proposals are illogical, tyrannical and impertinent.You may remember that one of David Cameronrsquos first acts was to set up a ldquonudge unit , which was given National Lottery money to persuade us to insulate our lofts and pay our vehicle excise duty by direct debit. I can only assume that Nicola Sturgeon has secretly set up some kind of bloody great shove unit, since the chief interest of the Holyrood Parliament seems to be to tell us what to do.Standards of education may be falling, hospital waiting lists growing, pay and productivity stagnating and public spending going up but Ms Sturgeon and her sidekicks, such as Joe Fitzpatrick, the Minister for Public Health, Sport and Wellbeing, are convinced of the need for ldquodecisive action on crisps and ginger.ldquoBy restricting at the point of purchase the promotion and marketing of foods that have next to no nutritional value, it is reasonable to expect less of these foods will be purchased, improving over time our diet-related health, he explained. Though Mr Fitzpatrick may think it reasonable, the facts donrsquot bear him out.There are few areas as contentious, as riddled with contradictions, and as dominated by special interests as the debate on public health. Those special interests are not merely the drinks companies, tobacco manufacturers, ldquoBig Pharma and the food industry, but nutritionists, epidemiologists and activists, usually funded by the public purse, who have issued conflicting and contradictory advice. From the s, nutritionists, led by Lord Boyd Orr, argued that people should eat more milk, eggs, butter and meat, and cut down on potatoes and bread in the s, they argued that dairy and other fatty foods were the problem, and that people should eat more grains and cereals nowadays, the primary enemies are sugar, salt and bacon.The reality is that studies that purport to show, for example, that bacon causes cancer, and which lead to hysterical headlines, usually have only very minor indicators. But they are seized upon as ldquotargets for action. Whatrsquos more, the evidence is ignoreditrsquos not helpful: the constantly changing drinking guidelines, for example, are based on data that shows that those who have one or two drinksevery day are healthier than non-drinkers. Yet to acknowledge that would undermine the general message that overall alcohol consumption should be lowered ndash even though it is, in historical terms, at one of its lowest levels ever.Evenscientists could agree on the perfect dietthere remains the problem that it works onlypeople follow it. This is where the activists and politicians, crying with Cicero salus populi suprema lex esto , jump in.They take contradictory and half-understood dietary science and impose it with contradictory and half-understood methods for changing peoplersquos behaviour. The quantity of salt and sugar in todayrsquos processed foods, for example, is in part because of the reduction in their fat content which governments previously imposed on manufacturers. Many of such tactics have been useless or counter-productive. The recent change to the recipe for Coco-Pops, for example, was designed to cut down the sugar content, to fight the ldquoobesity epidemic. The new recipe has  per cent less sugar, but is one calorie lower than the old one, which you may not regard as a stunning victory in the war against fat.Anti-smoking activists, ignoring the fact that vaping is the single biggest contributor to the recent reduction in smoking, want it banned, on no scientic evidence. Meanwhile, they remain convinced of the effectiveness of plain packaging, although smoking increased in Australia after the measure was brought in there.The sugary drinks tax isnrsquot doing any better. James Loker, also from TRDP, said that ldquoessentially sugary drinks are doing as well as they always have, and in some cases actually better. The only drinks where sales were down, he concluded, were those, such as Irn Bru and Ribena, that had changed their recipes to include less sugar.On the whole, people know what they should do: eat a balanced diet, take more exercise , donrsquot smoke and donrsquot drink too much. Butthey wonrsquot, the Government is on a hiding to nothing trying to make them. Evenit improved a few peoplersquos health, it would not justy the imposition on everyone ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-glory-of-english-language-in-all-of-its-foibles","story":"I have many very good examples of the use of conjunctions to begin sentences, and paragraphs too, especially in Walter Bagehotrsquos Literary Studies .He frequently begins a sentence with ldquobutas when he writes of the French coup drsquoetat of , and of the previous system of government. ldquoIt was a system of regulated corruption.

This was the international organisation testing the chemicals used in the Salisbury poisoning and which turned out to be Novichok, a nerve agent created in Russia during the Soviet era.But once exposed, the Kremlinrsquos spies were sent packing back to Moscow by Dutch security services, leaving behind them a treasure trove of intelligence about their covert activities.The Dutch operation followed just weeks after the attempted assassination of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March by two fellow GRU officers.In the days and weeks that followed, British officials said Russia spy teams attempted to hack the computers of the Foreign Office and the science laboratory at Porton Down, which was, of course, investigating the deadly nerve agent used in Salisbury.When the GRUrsquos spear-phishing attempts at the headquarters of the OPCW failed, its chiefs ordered Unit  to go to the Netherlands to seethey could have more luck.Yet right from the start they appear to have made little attempt to hide their presence in the country, arriving together with Russian diplomatic passports at Schiphol Airport, where they were captured on CCTV being met by a Russian embassy official.Once through customs and immigration controls, the Russian team hired a car and headed for The Hague.

Customer research by Scottish Water revealed tap is the water of choice for almost two thirds of people in Scotland , and currently over a thirdcarry reusable bottles always or often when out and about. But less than a thirdsaid theyd be happy to go into a cafeacute and ask for their bottle to be filled.On average a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save pound. a day, nearly pound a year.The Top Up Taps are made from marine-grade steel and are connected to the mains water supply.* For further information visit www.yourwateryourleFriday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117685.jpg","title":"Wind turbine blades hold up town traffic","story":"MOTORISTS making their way through Wick faced a delay as an extra-long convoy of trucks set out for Bad a Cheo wind farm on the Causewaymire.Three giant blades each measuring  metres were driven up from Wick harbour by lorries from Campbeltown-based McFadyens with an escort of the companys support vehicles.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV.

His imminent departure from Labour’s frontbench was even referred to by SNP health secretary Jeane Freeman in the debate on “women in sport”.: SNP figures pile Scottish independence pressure on Nicola SturgeonMr Sarwar met Mr Leonard to be told of his demotion – a courtesy that was not extended to Ms Baillie, the Dumbarton MSP who left parliament at pm sharp after several hours of speculation over her position.Ms Baillie, who is the only Labour MSP to have represented the same constituency since the birth of devolution in , was sacked over the phone from her job as shadow economy spokeswoman.Mr Leonard’s reshuffle came on the same day Scottish Labour’s head of communications Charlie Mann quit, saying the job was “not for me”.His departure followed several days of infighting over UK Labour’s controversial decision to halt its funding for former Scottish leader Kezia Dugdale’s legal battle against a pro-independence blogger. A majority of Labour MSPs believe the party should fully fund Ms Dugdale’s legal fees after Stuart Campbell, from the Wings Over Scotland ­website, brought a £, defamation case against her. Left-wing allies of Mr Leonard had claimed Ms Dugdale’s supporters were undermining his leadership. Mr Leonard had been criticised for failing to do enough to get the UK party to over-turn its decision. Mr Leonard claimed his new team would “focus on unity and the public, not ourselves and internal battles”.But hopes of uniting the party were dashed as soon as the shadow cabinet was announced. One Labour source described it as a “victory of factionalism over competence”. “It is like taking your two best players off the pitch when you’re three-nil down,” the source said. “This is straight out of the Corbyn playbook.”Mr Murray was angered by the dismissals. On Mr Sarwar’s sacking, Mr Murray said: “The purge of good, capable and committed people goes on merely for standing up for what they believe in. One of our most effective and likeable MSPs. I don’t know whether to be angry or sad. I thought Richard was better than this.”Moving on to Ms Baillie’s departure, Mr Murray said he was “sad, sad, sad” to see her sacked, describing her as “one of the most effective MSPs in Holyrood and very well liked in her constituency”.Mr Sarwar said: “It’s a shame I came to know about this decision through Twitter, while I was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber. I am incredibly proud of the work I did on behalf of NHS patients and staff, particularly the creation of a workforce commission, the campaign to end the pay cap and the fight to protect local services from SNP cuts. “For the sake of all the people who need a Labour government, I wish Richard Leonard and his shadow cabinet all the very best. I will continue to serve my constituents tirelessly from the backbenches, campaigning for issues close to my heart.”Monica Lennon is taking on the health post for the party. Mr Leonard will combine his leadership with the economy brief. In another controversial move Alex Rowley, Scottish Labour’s former acting leader who was suspended over harassment claims, was reinstated to the shadow cabinet. Mr Rowley, who rejected the claims, was appointed to the local government brief.Ms Baillie said: “I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve and will continue to be a strong advocate for my constituents – and Labour values. I wish Richard Leonard well for the future.” Mr Leonard said: “The refreshed shadow cabinet will take Scottish Labour into the central debate in Scottish politics: the clear choice between Labour’s plan to invest and build an economy that works for the many, not the few, or further austerity with the SNP and the Tories.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4810631.1538745845!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish government commits 250k to indonesia earthquake aid","story":"The Scottish Government will provide #, to help those affected by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.The cash will be given to aid agencies to provide food, clean drinking water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, as well as helping survivors cope with the trauma.: Charity donates £k to Indonesia appealMore than , people are thought to be dead, missing or injured after last week’s .-magnitude tremor and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, with up to . million people affected.International Development Minister Ben Macpherson said: “The earthquake and resulting tsunami in Indonesia has caused terrible suffering, with more than , people having tragically lost their lives and countless more displaced and in need of urgent assistance.“We want Scotland to be a good global citizen and our Humanitarian Emergency Fundaims to provide emergency le-saving aid to those most in need.“Our HEF  member agencies are ready to provide in-country support to those caught up in this tragedy, many of whom are children.“This financial support will help to provide much needed assistance.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture.

And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well.

All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery.

Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC.

When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief. Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes.

A spokesperson for Dromore Nursery said: “As outstanding early years educators, we aim to offer every child equality of opportunity, it has not always been easy to translate this aspiration into practice. However, it has been delivered through genuine commitment and a willingness to challenge the deep rooted, often unquestioned, attitudes, values and practices which can and do discriminate against some children and families. “It is not about ‘treating all children the same’.

The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church. People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches. We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”Of the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. “There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.   Minister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd “You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”Of the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm.Sad passing of Molly Lutton Shoppers urged to continue to show support for Belfast city centre retailers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

My son was on the bus on this way into work when he looked over in the direction of the grave, he was shocked to see this massive tree lying on it, he rang me immediately and we headed up to speak to the cemetery staff.”It was during the course of a conversation with Council workers that Mr Osborne was informed that Council employees are not permitted to use chain saws to cut away fallen tress and that they have to wait on an outside agency coming in to carry out the work. He was also told he and his sons wouldn’t be allowed to do the job themselves.Gerry added: “I was shocked to hear this, I was more than willing to come up with my sons and remove the tree myself but I was told I couldn’t.“The cemetery staff have been very helpful and sympathetic, but the tree is still here over two weeks later, and it’s not exactly small. Whatone of us has an accident while we are here tending the grave  I understand that Belfast City Council’s hands are tied, they have been great, but we feel asthis outside contractor who has to carry the work out is in absolutely no hurry to do so, these are ridiculous health and safety rules.“The cemetery itself is beautul and very well kept by the staff, so whoever is responsible for cleaning up this mess needs to take a leaf out of their book and get on with it.”West Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Stevie Corr said: “Under health and safety legislation council staff are not permitted to use chain saws, they are going through the proper process at the moment, but I know that is of no comfort to the Osborne family who are clearly and understandably upset.“I am a representative on the Strategic Cemeteries and Crematorium working group and I will raise this issue as a matter of urgency, I will also be raising the issue around giving our cemetery and park staff back the skills and authority to use chainsaws to cut down and remove obstructions like this. This is obviously outsourced and we want to bring it back in house again.”Cllr Corr added: “The matter was only raised with me today and we are already working on getting it dealt with.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We are aware of a number of damaged and fallen trees at City Cemetery, caused by Storm Ali. A specialist company is working to clear these but, because of the amount of damage, this is taking some time. However, our contractor is working as quickly as possible and we hope to have all the debris cleared in the near future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"barrister taking legal action over electoral commissions decision not to investigate dup brexit donation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital. The doctor displayed to the court the way in which Mr ONeill tried to revive his daughter, a movement he described as \"vigorous\". Counsel for Mr ONeill said it conflicted with that of another medic who gave evidence on the first day.Dr McCabe added that this did not change the approach to Caraghs treatment.Mr ONeill attended the inquest yesterday, which is set to last for five days."},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

We turned it into our family holiday, though we had to load the boot up with a lot of spare parts just in case, as we werent really sureour work on the car would last the pace.\"We thought about driving straight to Cortina and back again, but it was too good an opportunity to waste, so we planned the trip to take in a lot of the sights all of us wanted to see around Europe. It all went so well and we might plan another one.\"Apart from the UK, the car passed through the Republic, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Monaco.\"Weve been through the Black Forest, driven across the Millau Viaduct in southern France, the highest bridge in the world, and around the famous Stelvio Pass in the north of Italy with its  hairpin bends,\" said Mandy.\"When we arrived in Cortina DAmpezzo in Italy the locals were amazed to see the car. \"There are not that many of them still around, and even fewer managed to make it back to the town they were named after.\"Back in  a new Ford Cortina would have completed around  miles to the gallon, but Mandy said she wanted to make the car as economical as possible.\"You could say I had a trip like this in the back of my mind when we put a diesel engine in it, and in the end we were getting up to mpg, so that was well worth it considering how far weve managed to travel in it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"belfast international airport apology after chaotic delays at security checks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning. Customer services staff were on hand to deal with any passenger queries and  indeed any passengers with feedback or complaints we would ask them to contact the airport directly so that we may resolve their issues.\"Dont forget to arrive at least  hours before your flight and that carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security.

He said he queued for an hour on Monday and while he made his flight with time to spare he said others turned back in the queue saying they had missed theirs.\"The queue was all the way down the escalator,\" he said.\"I just couldnt understand it as all the lines were open and they were processing everyone at a fair rate. It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"The airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant sheep skinned in northern ireland field legs chopped","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Timothy Johnston giving evidence to the RHI Inquiry on Thursday Mr Johnston rejected that and told the inquiry that he had no interest in relation to RHI or role in cost controls.But an email which Mr Cairns gave to the inquiry on Wednesday night shows that he was in contact with Mr Johnston about RHI. On August , Mr Cairns emailed him in relation to another renewable energy issue on which they were jointly working, the NIRO electricity subsidy.Mr Cairns went on to say: “We also need to get a catch up on renewable heat. If we are to deviate from GB policy, it will require a ministerial direction [the nuclear option for a minister].”Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said it seemed “a pretty clear suggestion that somebody somewhere was saying ‘don’t put [cost controls] in’.Mr Johnston faced sustained questioning about the topic, with barrister Donal Lunny saying that it “seems to assume a degree of knowledge” about the issue, with the language being “cryptic” to the uninitiated. Mr Johnston said Mr Cairns may have assumed he had more knowledge than he had.When askedhe read the email, Mr Johnston initially said that he “probably skimmed it”. Sir Patrick put it to him that “it’s not a long email ... so skimming it means you probably read it ”Mr Johnston said: “Yes, I thinkyou’re pushing me – I can’t be absolutely % certain.”Sir Patrick asked why Mr Johnston had not instantly phoned or gone down the corridor to ask “what on earth are you telling me about ‘deviation’ for  I haven’t said anything about this. You must have got the wrong person”.Mr Johnston said: “I certainly ... have no sense that I did do that ... I have no sense that at the time I paid a lot of attention to it.”Sir Patrick said the “probable” explanation was that Mr Cairns referred to RHI as he did because there had been an exchange with Mr Johnston on the issue such as the one where he is alleged to have said no to cost controls. Mr Johnston said that he had denied that. But Sir Patrick said: “On this evidence, that [Mr Cairns’ account] fits.”Mr Johnston was asked “had you forgotten about that communication until you saw that email today ” He said: “Yes. Absolutely. And not only that, but I mean it doesn’t massively jog my memory ... I take that email to be ‘Tim, you’ve been away on your holidays, you’ve come back, you’ve a lot of other stuff on we need to talk about RHI’.”Gregory Campbell: Working-class Protestants feared what civil rights movement would becomeDubkin urges May to publish plan to break border deadlock Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dame Una O’Brien said: “But Mr Johnston, it doesn’t actually say that ... If Mr Cairns’s sentence said as you’ve described, I could get that. But it actually doesn’t say that, does it “On any common sense reading, it implies some degree of previous engagement on it – ‘ we are going to deviate’. There’s a gap between what you’re saying it seems to be saying and what it is actually saying.”Mr Johnston said: “I can see that. All I can set out for you is as I both recall it and believe it to be the case that it wasn’t a case that I had ever suggested at any [time] let’s not have tarf controls, or let’s delay them ...”Mr Lunny put it to him that – given that he now accepts he had forgotten about that exchange – there may have been other occasions where RHI was mentioned.Mr Johnston said: “I can’t rule that out. I can’t rule that out. All I can say to you very definitively is that I’m absolutely clear – because it would stick in my memory –I had given the guys to believe, or pushed the notion, or encouraged them down the route of saying ‘there’s not going to be cost controls’ I’m absolutely clear that wasn’t the case.”try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The contractors that we represent are adamant that this stand-off cannot continue.”“They are at breaking point as the realities of managing their businesses on a day to day basis, whilst serving patients and customers, is causing severe strain.” “The cost of providing the community pharmacy service is hugely underfunded due to a shortfall in what the Department of Health is willing to allocate, and the cost of keeping community pharmacies open. Some contractors have told us that they are ready to go out of business. This is unacceptable and must be urgently addressed.“We are calling for clear and fair remuneration and reimbursement so that investment can take place to meet safety, quality and efficacy requirements. At present that just does not exist.”One leading Community Pharmacist, Paul Savage from Belfast added: “Consistent underfunding means that myself and my community pharmacy colleagues everywhere cannot afford to keep normal stocks of medicines which shows how grave the situation is.”“It is completely unacceptable and unjust that we have been forced to subsidise the provision of an essential healthcare service due to this lack of funding.”“The year on year increase in workload of community pharmacists’ means that we have still to undertake a combination of core dispensing, over the counter medicine supply and advice, wider community pharmacy services and employ a skilled workforce at the same time as the level of funding from government has, in real terms decreased.”Mums concern as her daughter’s le-saving EpiPen goes out of date amid shortage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer.

Alan was a little out, but not by much, writes Justin Rush.  The automation of processes has been one of the hottest discussion topics in . Given that recruitment of staff is a tremendously time intensive process, and one which requires consistency it must surely be a perfect candidate for automation  Well yes… and no. Automation can assist a great deal, but it can’t do everything, not yet anyway.  It is important to know, candidates that are active in today’s employment market are more and more accustomed to using automated chatbots as part of the recruitment process. Non-human involvement equates to zero bias, and therefore reinforces fairness. This is a massive plus point. In a survey by Allegis, % of candidates stated they were comfortable interacting with AI and recruitment chatbots in the early stages of the application process. An even larger proportion - % - were comfortable with chatbots taking care of interview scheduling and preparation.  So what benefits can your business gain from appointing a Recruit-bot Streamlining the applicant journey, by ensuring consistency in the recruitment process and asking screening questions and answering FAQs.Ranking applications, this can be undertaken fairly and quickly based upon candidate submissions. As a result shortlisting is quick and clean.Scheduling assessments and tests, this can be straightforward and without human involvement.   responses, your bot will can exist across your website and all social channels simultaneously.  Your recruitment is now ‘always on’ engaging with potential hires.Repetitive tasks eliminated, creating reports, sending on-line forms or adding candidates to a management system can be a thing of the past.  So automation can really help, especially when volume of applications is a potential issue and you need consistency, or when you are recruiting globally across time zones and don’t want to miss out on a potential inquiry.  Some issues do still remain, despite the efforts of articial intelligence to do it all. In the main, these are the human factors, for example, the assessment of certain competencies that are essential for a job such as team-working.   At present, bots aren’t quite ready to handle the intricate aspects of the recruitment process that require patience and finesse. Answering more specic questions that more specialist professionals may want to ask about a job opportunity, selling the career opportunity or negotiation of salary and terms. These aspects are not part of any readily available algorithm… yet.
