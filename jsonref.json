Concrete residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments shot up across the country in a show of power from a state between two worlds, western democracy and the communist east. Photographs by Marko ĐuricaReuters. Written by Ivana Sekularac.Genex Tower is unmissable on the highway from Belgrade airport to the centre of the city. Its two soaring blocks, connected by an aerial bridge and topped with a long-closed rotating restaurant resembling a space capsule, are such an unusual sight, the 1977-build tower has become a magnet for tourists despite years of neglect. The tower is one of the most significant examples of brutalism – an architectural style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, based on crude, block-like forms cast from concrete.Brutalism was popular throughout the eastern bloc but the former Yugoslavia made it its own – seizing on it as a way to forge a visual identity poised between east and west. Interest in the style is soaring – particularly since a 2018 exhibition in New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980.“We have dozens of people every week interested in taking our Yugo tour around city landmarks built from the 1950s to 1980s,” says Vojin Muncin, manager of the Yugotour sightseeing agency which guides tourists around the Serbian capital in Yugos, the former Yugoslavia’s once ubiquitous car. “Genex Tower is among the most interesting sight. People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.” Today one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.After the second world war, socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country. The architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds – western democracy and the communist east, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.But after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.“Now enough time has passed (since Yugoslavia fell apart) and people have begun to appreciate the architecture of Yugoslavia,” says Alan Braun, lecturer at Zagreb University’s architecture faculty. He explains that the style was unique because of its visible influence from the west, reflecting Yugoslavia’s unique position. Residential areas were planned to have enough parks, cinemas, swimming pools and even parking space.Keen to capitalise on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism – the Palata Srbija (Palace of Serbia) government building, which is currently only open once a year.The Palata Srbija building hosted former world leaders such as US presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Russian leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. Each of the former Yugoslav republics had its own salon with a central room called the hall of Yugoslavia.Furniture and carpets were custom made and prominent artists produced paintings and mosaics. The outside of the building is concrete, but the inside is marble. Its centrepiece is a crystal chandelier beneath a 19-metre dome weighing more than nine tonnes. “It is a shame to keep such a master piece away from the eyes of the public,” said Sandra Vesic Tesla, curator of the building.Other examples of Yugoslav brutalism include the huge memorials commemorating the struggle against fascism by Tito’s partisans, often placed in dramatic rural settings. Many of those pieces of art remain in disrepair, such as the monument to the uprising against fascism in Petrova Gora in Croatia.However, the Tjentiste memorial, commemorating the killing of 7,000 people by the Nazis was renovated last year. Miodrag Zivkovic, the 91-year-old sculptor of the 19-metre-high concrete Tjentiste memorial, was among the first artists in the former Yugoslavia to use concrete.“It is stable material, resembling stone but it is easier to work with,” he said. “For every project back in those days there was a national contest, and artists from all over the country had the opportunity to apply, and that competition produced quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3d01e346b86a9ae21a5d1e4ddf5673acbc1989/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dec88a9a57f80ae52053e90f8130cb4","title":"how philip pullman lyra won the world","story":"As His Dark Materials comes to TV, the prize-winning children’s author Katherine Rundell looks at how a scrappy girl became one of literature’s best-loved charactersI first read Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy as a young teen it felt like a revelation. The books had a rough-textured animal-breath closeness that I had rarely encountered before, and at the heart of that was a small child, swift witted and loose handed with the truth, throwing mud at rival children, and her soul companion, her daemon Pantalaimon. I decided there and then, with all acknowledgements to the glory and joy of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, of Sophie in Diana Wynne Jones’s Howl’s Moving Castle, of Malorie Blackman’s Sephy Hadley in Noughts \u0026amp Crosses and of Roald Dahl’s Matilda, that the greatest heroine in British children’s books was Lyra.There is good evidence that many people of my generation felt the same. Pullman now shares with Shakespeare, Jonathan Swift and Philip Sidney the distinction of having invented a popular English-language name that has become so popular it’s now part of the lexicon. We owe the name Vanessa to Swift, who gave it as a piglatinish nickname to his lover Esther (Esse for short) Vanhomrigh, and Pamela (originally pronounced, originally, Pameela) to Sidney. Shakespeare has at least two the first sighting we have of Miranda (from mirandus, meaning wonderful) is The Tempest, and Jessica, probably in an Anglicisation of the Old Testament Hebrew name Iscah, first appears in English in The Merchant of Venice. And last year, 362 new Lyras were born.The name came, originally, from a misunderstanding. Pullman told the New Yorker: “There was a hymn I particularly liked called ‘Jesus Christ Is Risen Today, Alleluia’ … And under the number of the hymn, printed in small italics, was usually the name of the author. In this case, the name there was Lyra Davidica.” It was, he thought, a good name. “In fact, what Lyra Davidica means is the ‘harp of David’. ‘Lyra’ is a Greek word for a musical instrument like a harp.”Where did Lyra herself come from? She has, I think, DNA from many places: from the tricksters in old English ballads, from William Brown and his Outlaws, from the orphaned Cinderella (not the Disney one the versions from the 17th and 18th centuries, who had wit and guile and an edge of ruthlessness on their side. In Giambattista Basile’s La Gatta Cenerentola, Zezolla murders her stepmother by chopping off her head with the lid of a trunk.) Pullman told me: “Lyra just came to me as she was. I didn’t change a bit, or alter anything to her advantage. Having taught in middle schools for 12 years or so, I was well aware that there was a Lyra in every class. The point I always make, when asked about it, is that Lyra is not special. She’s ordinary, not to say common. But it’s the qualities she shares with so many real girls that help her when she finds herself in extraordinary circumstances.”So Lyra is in some ways utterly commonplace: solid legged, dirty nailed, a liar without much concern about the consequences of her lies. That ordinariness is what makes her so vivid despite the fact that the witches have a prophecy about her, she doesn’t have, unlike Harry Potter, any particular magic: she has nothing in her that makes her uniquely suited for her task ahead. She is made, not born, a hero. As Pullman says, “I’m an old-fashioned existentialist in some ways: existence precedes essence, and I’ll fight anyone who says different.” It takes work, the books tell us, to become a heroine: strenuous effort, constant attention to the world, a willingness to peel back the layers of your own heart.But of course she is also not ordinary, because she has in her possession a compass-like device that can tell the truth, one of the loveliest inventions of children’s fiction, alongside Tolkien’s ring and Rowling’s pensieve: an alethiometer (from the Greek aletheia, truth). Her ability to read it gives her, in the world of the book, an extraordinary authority that most children are denied. She is able to transcend that one factor of childhood that I found hardest to bear: the sense of disfranchisement from a world that extends so far beyond your understanding as to be painfully opaque. I read with a fierce hunger to see the world I hated, above everything, not understanding.I think a true hero or heroine needs to have both something we want or covet (for instance, a princedom in Denmark a fairy godmother) and something that we are (tormented by our own uncertainties transformable). Lyra has both in Pantalaimon. The daemons – animal manifestations of the human soul – are the reason the books pulse with life: they have, after all, twice the usual amount of life in them. I am often asked, by children I meet at school visits or book festivals, what would be my daemon? It became to a whole generation of readers a kind of taxonomy of self-definition (I think mine would be something that seeks to be up high: a squirrel, or a bird of the less glossy kind. Be wary of people who say “a leopard”: they do not know themselves.)The thing I wanted most, though, changed over the course of the books. By The Amber Spyglass, the final book in the trilogy, what I wanted was not the alethiometer, nor even a daemon, but the love. Lyra falls in love with Will Parry, and finds herself stunned. Their love is physically felt: “I want to kiss you and lie down with you and wake up with you every day of my life till I die.” Sexuality, and the adult love that comes with it, is in Pullman’s world something to cherish: something, seen in its true light, more astonishing and surprising even than riding over snow on an armoured bear. Pullman said in an interview a few years ago that, if the book is a version of Paradise Lost, “what I wanted to do was represent the fall as entirely good. It is good for people to know things, to grow up, to become sexual beings.”And Lyra’s love allows her a different kind of seeing: it is the transformative vision of her love that allows her – without giving away the plot – to save Pullman’s world. That is, perhaps, the final reason Lyra has been so loved: she is in part Pullman’s longhand philosophical proof of an argument at the heart of all three books of the trilogy: notice. Lyra and Pan’s eyes are everywhere. She is curious above everything. It is the core demand of the books: pay loving attention to the world. We owe the world our ferocious attention, to fail at that would be the true fall.I’ve been writing children’s books for more than a decade now when I go to speak at schools, irrespective of country, the children’s questions are often the same. (“Where do you get your ideas from? Do you ever get stuck? How much money do you make? Do you write with a pen?” These all seem entirely fair questions to me, and in fact are what I long to ask other writers.) But recently at a festival in Italy, I met a more than usually philosophical group of 12 year olds. They asked: “What is the colour of happiness?” and “What one thing would you change about your life?” – like being interviewed by a gang of small, glitterpen wielding Kierkegaards. The last question was, “What is it you are trying to do when you write?” and I thought of His Dark Materials. As a child those books felt to me like food. So what I am trying to do is informed profoundly by that: I want to build stories that feel like nourishment. His Dark Materials stands as a testament to what children’s books can be: three books that add up to a feast.• His Dark Materials begins on BBC1 at 8pm on 3 November. Katherine Rundell’s most recent book for children, The Good Thieves (Bloomsbury), is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2c666cc5fa4a02f7e0758552ed809e09aa789f/0_283_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed2b3e5dca00e442507239369f3af4e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The shares were initially priced at $20, and soared to more than $50 in the weeks following the initial public offer. But it has suffered in recent years from competition from bigger rivals Apple, Samsung and China’s Xiaomi.The deal, which is Google’s biggest consumer purchase since it bought home-tech business Nest five years ago for $3bn, will have to be approved by shareholders and regulators, especially over how it handles Fitbit users’ data. Its fitness trackers store physical health data for users who track their activity and exercising using a range of wearable devicesFitbit said it would not sell customers’ personal data and that wellness data would not be used by Google ads.Google has offered its own fitness tracking service, called Google Fit, since 2014, but has relied on third parties such as Fossil to produce Android-compatible smartwatches.The deal will expand Google’s range of consumer products, which already includes smartphones, headphones, smart speakers and laptops.Earlier this week, amid reports that the deal was being finalised,the British Labour party wrote to the UK’s competition regulator calling for the takeover to be blocked. Tom Watson, the shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, called the deal a “data grab”.Fitbit insisted its users’ data would be safe in the hands of its new owner. In a statement it said: “Consumer trust is paramount to Fitbit. Strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of Fitbit’s DNA since day one, and this will not change. Fitbit will continue to put users in control of their data and will remain transparent about the data it collects and why.”The deal is expected to be completed in 2020, but still needs approval from shareholders and regulators.Fitbit co-founder and CEO, James Park, said: “Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission. With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be80c9ed687f24463f1dabc243f1ed613820c133/0_326_5097_3059/master/5097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6496ddcb84b547b7ce0852383fbbb85c","title":"virgil abloh fans queue overnight at wembley ikea to buy homewear","story":"People sleep on sofas to be first in line for Louis Vuitton menswear designer’s Ikea rangeA level of hype usually reserved for streetwear drops in London’s Soho or Tokyo’s Harajuku could be found at the Wembley branch of Ikea on Friday morning, as the collaboration between the Swedish homeware store and one of the hottest names in fashion, Virgil Abloh, finally went on sale.The Louis Vuitton menswear designer and the founder of the streetwear brand Off-White is known for having a cult following, which explains the throngs who turned up next to a rainy North Circular to buy items from his 15-piece collection. The designs include a backlit take on the Mona Lisa for £65 and a chair with a doorstop attached to one of its legs (£99).Called Markerad, the collection has been generating huge amounts of buzz since it was announced at Paris fashion week last year. When free tickets for the launch were released online on 9 October they sold out in less than five minutes.Billed as the “world’s comfiest queue”, the scattered sofas were not plentiful enough to go around in the final hour. People came from as far away as Italy and as nearby as the end of the Central Line – midwife Tara Spurrs arrived after a nightshift to check on her 16-year-old son at the front of the queue – and several stayed overnight.Many of those waiting were big fans of Abloh. “Virgil’s done it and I like Off-White,” said Leon Henry, 19, a construction worker who was first in line, arriving at 10am on Thursday and surviving on a diet of UberEats. Andrew Nakysmowski, 27, who travelled from Manchester to be there, said: “His designs are quite innovative. People hate him as well, which I quite like. I think he’s interesting and different to what normal designers are like, so I have a lot of respect for him.”Abloh-designed Ikea rugs sold for thousands on resale sites earlier this year and many in the queue were hoping to make some money from their purchases. José Martins, 29, who has previously resold items from the skate brands Supreme and Palace, already had a buyer willing to pay £700 for one of the £200 rugs. “Basically we are buying Louis Vuitton stuff for the price of Ikea,” he said. But not everyone planned to resell their purchases. Nakysmowski said he was “looking for some new furniture for my flat and I’ve always really liked Virgil Abloh”.Among the items generating the most buzz is a wall clock, priced at £25, decorated with the word “temporary” and a rug that reads “wet grass”, costing £199. Another rug is made to resemble an Ikea receipt and is going for £75. As J Frank, 21, explained: “It’s almost taking the piss it’s a bit meta. You’re paying for an Ikea receipt that you’re going to receive when you buy it.”Abloh throws light on the collection on Ikea’s website: “It’s about elevating the anonymous, everyday icons that we use without noticing.”Waiting in line has become a modern phenomenon in recent years thanks to the world of streetwear and Carbafho explained how “to be able to say that you queued overnight, and went to this launch, is quite a nice thing to be a part of”. She and her friends had been taking it in turns to nap since midnight.It is not the first time Ikea has found itself at the centre of a fashion storm – in 2017 the influential label Balenciaga sold a design uncannily similar to Ikea’s blue and yellow Frakta bag for £1,365.The Markerad collection will be on sale at the Wembley, Croydon and Dublin stores until 3 November for those with tickets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b44b7d6c481f6ea22ac66edd533aafa75a1e895/0_683_5154_3093/master/5154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c32b204bb0bed4b45335ad1bce4724","title":"does obamas critique of radical politics help bring about the change he wanted","story":"The former president took black and progressive movements to task, without understanding his own failure to deliver change• Call-out culture: how to get it right (and wrong)On Tuesday, in Chicago, former president Barack Obama joined actress Yara Shahidi in a conversation with activists from his Obama Foundation program. Over the nearly 1.5-hour Obama Foundation summit event, the beloved political figure deployed his trademark charm and humor while discussing the challenges of movement politics.Media attention has focused on a particular part of the conversation – Obama’s criticism of call-out culture and what he perceived as an excessively strident activist left. “We can’t completely remake society in a minute,” Obama said, “so we have to make some accommodations to the existing structures.”He added, “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you.”He then made a separate point about social media activism:“If I tweet or hashtag about how you didn’t do something right or used the wrong verb, I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. ‘Man you see how woke I was, I called you out.’” But “that’s not activism. That’s not bringing about change.”On its face, these are fair remarks. During the session, both Obama and Shahidi drew from examples of the nonviolent civil rights movement of the early 1960s, which required enormous faith, patience and compromise from its activists in the face of threats to their lives and livelihood. Today, as social justice activists’ material conditions have relatively improved, they will encounter people in positions of power with wealth and access, and they have to learn to work with them on some level, Obama implied. And no, tweeting about a verb probably won’t bring about change.However, we can’t look at Obama’s remarks in a vacuum. From 2016 – as he prepared to exert his influence over who would be the next Democratic nominee – to the present, Obama has often aimed his political critiques at youth-led, black and progressive movements. While upholding the necessity of nuance, Obama himself seems to force these movements into a box, cherry-picking anecdotes for a strawman: that these movements expect purity and demand perfection.In an early instance of this ideological pattern, at a 2016 youth town hall in London, Obama spoke generally of Black Lives Matter while referring to the handful of activists who confronted the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her role in criminalizing black youth:“Once you’ve highlighted an issue and brought it to people’s attention … then you can’t just keep on yelling at them. And you can’t refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position. The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room.”A few months later in a Howard commencement address, with Chicago protests of the police killing of Laquan McDonald not far in the distance, he told the audience of mostly black students about his criminal justice reform as a state senator:And earlier this year, Obama again raised the amorphous specter of purity politics as people have embraced a leftward policy shift:“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States … is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Uh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be’ and then we start … a ‘circular firing squad’, where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues.”Obama has offered these platitudes without much evidence that progressives, Black Lives Matter activists or young voters expect purity. Impatience with the status quo is not purity. A consistent political project is not purity. And being patient has its limits.You can gather from the general direction of Obama’s career, from turning down a route in corporate law to his community organizing, that he has some commitment to social justice. However, his remarks indicate discomfort with more radical tactics in achieving it, reducing them to petulant zeal and not a legitimate strategy among the broad scope of tools needed to dismantle oppressive systems.While discussing Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King as examples of patient progress, he freezes them in time. He failed to note either King’s or Parks’s evolutions. Over time King became more radicalized and questioned integration. When Parks was forced to Detroit to retreat from the backlash against her bus boycott activism, she became a proponent of the Panthers’ self-defense demands and identified Malcolm X as her personal hero.Obama also failed to discuss how, despite King’s strategies negotiating with Lyndon Johnson to sign the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress waffled in passing further civil rights measures until the 1968 riots after King’s assassination, when Congress was forced to swiftly pass the Fair Housing Act.Or go back further: despite the negotiations and patience of abolitionists in the 1800s, it was a steady stream of black uprisings, and an entire civil war, that gave abolition laws and the Emancipation Proclamation any teeth.Obama’s fundamental problem is in confusing a strategy of pragmatism with the strategy. Pragmatic approaches can coexist with more radical politics. But Obama’s pattern of dismissing radical demands altogether shows a serious unwillingness to appreciate the times. Obama is committed to a notion of reaching across the aisle that may have seemed necessary in 2012, but not so much in 2019.Americans in the throes of economic struggle and social oppression have been advised to hold their nose for so long that they’re suffocating. The labor movement is experiencing more worker strikes now than in the past 40 years. We’re in a 1968 moment, not 1963. But Obama has not accepted this evolution.As people demand universal policies for basic needs of shelter, food, freedom from police terror, and economic security, and when wealth inequality is the worst in a century, Obama has to reckon with his own questions. How is his form of calling out – scolding black, young and progressive movements – bringing about change? Is he part of the solution or part of the problem?For many Americans, the normalization of genuinely leftwing policies is providing the hope and change Obama campaigned on. This is the time for him to finally help achieve it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0359e3a1a37d77a16844f01f68bdb7ee59fd5e/0_14_3844_2307/master/3844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afa49c963f1ba3667c3d8aa6e6f823b5","title":"japan rising sun flag history olympic ban south korea","story":"Imagine if, at the opening ceremony of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the stadium were filled to capacity with fans waving the American Confederate flag. A similarly hurtful scene could become reality at the Tokyo Games next summer, if the Japanese “rising sun” flag is on display.Japanese athletes and fans regularly sport their national flag – a red ball centred on white. The rising sun symbol is different, however. A red ball with 16 red rays, it is sometimes used by companies in advertisements, yet it is technically a military flag: from 1870 until the end of the second world war, it was imperial Japan’s war flag. Since 1954, a renewed version of the rising sun has been the banner of the Japanese navy, known as the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force.South Korea, which was under Japanese rule from 1910 until 1945, has asked Japan to ban the flag from Olympic stands next year. Tokyo has so far refused, explaining that the flag is “widely used in Japan” and is “not considered a political statement”. But it is not Japan’s national flag, so the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has the authority to exclude it from the Tokyo Games. The leaders of the IOC, together with athletes and their supporters from around the world, should take note of the flag’s history, and how it is, in fact, used to make a particular political statement in Japan today.For the Japanese right, flying the rising sun flag is part of a collective effort to cleanse the history of imperial Japan’s aggression during the second world war. It appears in the promotional literature and on the websites of groups such as the Zaitokukai, whose members march with signs reading, “Koreans should be massacred!”, and the Nippon Kaigi, which counts the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, among its members, and has described the second world war in Asia as a “holy war of liberation”.By embracing the flag, followers signal their belief that the Japanese should take pride in their military history, atrocities included. They are trying to resurrect honour for the country’s failed war effort, much like Americans who cling to Confederate flags. Unlike the Nazi swastika, the rising sun symbol enjoys legal guarantees – under Japan’s freedom of speech laws – yet it causes intentional harm to those who suffered as well as to their descendants.Washington must take responsibility for this situation, too. Its perennial insistence that Japan and South Korea “work out among themselves” their wartime histories perpetuates the split by failing to address how the United States put in place many of the post-1945 problems that have affected the region. The standoff has become so bitter that Washington cannot even maintain a security pact arranged between Seoul and Tokyo to share intelligence about North Korean missile launches. Tokyo appears so confident of Washington’s backing that it willfully disregards Allied prisoner of war suffering during the second world war, just as it dismisses the pain endured by the Koreans.In the meantime, countless Japanese historians, activists and regular citizens have resisted the efforts of their own government to deny Japanese history, by continuing to dig up bones and government documents, and recording the oral testimonies of those who suffered during Japan’s imperial occupations and wars. Their work gives solid accounting to what happened under the rising sun flag. Too few survivors of Japan’s wartime atrocities remain alive to fill the Olympic stadium and explain the meaning of this symbol. The International Olympic Committee must learn from history instead.• Alexis Dudden is professor of history at the University of Connecticut"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b39760c4843c3e7acc11e2f0ca3e13083ee2369/224_574_4569_2742/master/4569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34407080b0b661926f77267d871012a2","title":"middle aged swing voters age class political","story":"Increasingly, age has taken the place that class once occupied as an indicator of political allegianceAn election is coming. You may have noticed. The early phase of any campaign is the contest about what the election will actually be about – where the battle lines will lie. If you’re gunning for the Conservatives or Liberal Democrats you probably want it to be all about Brexit if you’re backing Labour, probably anything but. Either way, we know with certainty that underlying the tactical battles of this election will be a crucial issue: age.In the same way that class dominated many elections of the 20th century, age has increasingly come to dominate in the 21st. A voter’s age wasn’t a decisive factor in which party they opted for in the 1970s, but it has become increasingly important as a predictor in recent decades. In 2017, a 30-year-old was twice as likely to back Labour as a 70-year-old. The latter, in turn, was more than twice as likely to vote Conservative. Come polling day, our age will do a lot of work in explaining who we vote for.It is a much bigger deal than this week’s overdone row about whether the 12 December election risks students – who disproportionately vote for Labour or the Lib Dems – heading for the hills as term ends rather than doing their democratic duty. In truth, it won’t make much difference given that Christmas doesn’t come quite that early to most universities.Meanwhile, our perception of what a “younger voter” actually is probably needs readjusting – in 2017, the tipping-point age at which you become more likely to vote Conservative than Labour was 47.Understanding the nature of the age ide in voting helps parties to clarify their priorities. There’s a reason the Conservatives prioritise pensioner benefits while cutting them for young low- and middle-income families. And for Labour, the 3 million parents bringing up children in the private rented sector – living with the worry that they could be asked to move out at a few months’ notice – are a big priority and outnumber the 2.3 million students.Age isions are not just superseding class in terms of their electoral significance they are taking on more of a class feel to them by way of economic isions. Today’s thirtysomethings, for example, are living with the biggest continuing hit to their wages from the financial crisis, in part because of the sheer bad luck of when they entered the labour market.This isn’t just about demography though. Geography is crucial too. Inidual places – which are what matters in a constituency-based, first-past-the-post system – have very different age profiles, and are ageing very differently as the country as a whole gets older. Across the UK, more than 60 local authority areas have a higher average age than Japan, the country with the highest average age overall – 46 – in the world. In contrast, other parts of Britain are demographically closer to young Latin America, with 23 local authority areas having a younger average age than Chile. The average Oxford resident is, at 29, barely half the age of someone in North Norfolk, the oldest place in Britain with an average age of 54.More importantly, Britain is growing apart as it ages. Rural areas such as Maldon, Eden and Richmondshire have aged twice as fast as the rest of the UK since 2001, while at the other extreme some cities have actually managed to get younger in the last two decades. Nottingham has lost three years, while all of Newcastle, Coventry and Bristol are defying the ageing process.Older areas are ageing quickly because there aren’t a lot of babies being born in places without many women of childbearing age, while younger places are seeing migration from within the country and from abroad holding down their average ages. And yes, universities are bringing in students to keep many cities younger.Combine this demographic ergence with the growing role of age in determining which party we vote for and you begin to see the shifting electoral battlegrounds over which the election will be fought. Old and young seats are becoming the new safe seats for the Conservatives and Labour respectively, just as old and young voters are becoming their core supporters. The middle aged, not the middle class, are the new swing voters. So, age is going to be central to this election – and many more to come. That’s what really matters, not whether a few universities happen to have wrapped term up before polling day.• Torsten Bell is director of the Resolution Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d3de68a5392bae101d1ab78f621331cb73e574/0_120_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46e1fa3f25aa59fb6b65089eb0de8676","title":"polls election brexit inequality","story":"A hard Brexit and entrenched inequality – or a nation where we can feed our kids and save the planet? It’s up to usElection night, 2017, at Harrow leisure centre was a tense affair. I had been in the borough for more than a month covering the battle for Harrow West – a Labour-held marginal that was 19th on the Tories’ target list. Labour won it in 1997 with a slim majority and had clung on to it ever since.The tension however, related to next-door Harrow East, a Tory constituency. It went to recounts, sending the Tory candidate pacing nervously in every direction. He had considered his seat safe the Labour MP for Harrow West believed his was at risk. Yet Labour won Harrow West by 13,314 votes, increasing its majority fivefold, while in Harrow East the Tory majority was reduced to just 1,757. I had been in the area to write about a seat that Labour might lose. It hadn’t occurred to me they might gain one.I wasn’t alone in this error. Labour had ploughed nearly all its resources into Harrow West. Its activists from both constituencies were grateful for the new votes but had no idea where they had come from.Today, Harrow East is the 36th target seat for Labour (Jeremy Corbyn was there earlier this week) Harrow West is 149th for the Tories, effectively off the radar but not necessarily out of the danger zone completely. After all, they are the same places they were two and a half years ago: the provenance of many of those votes remains a mystery and they could yet switch again. And much, politically, has happened since 2017 that could make them change their minds.We don’t know what the story of this forthcoming election will be. We may not know until it is over. The campaigns have only just started. People haven’t voted yet. Electability is, ultimately, decided not by opinion-forming elites but by the voters.Elections are not political thrillers. They are, or should be, about something real. Their significance should go beyond who wins, to what might change. Those two things are connected, of course, but not inextricably so. One of the reasons poor people are among the least likely to vote is because they often end up remaining poor, regardless of who wins. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter who wins – they could always get poorer. But nobody ever put that on a bumper sticker.Far more significant is what will change. There is more to politics than elections. The electoral conversation draws its energy from polls, gaffes, ads and swings. But none of that is particularly relevant unless it impacts people’s livelihoods, potential, challenges and life chances.It is easy to get stuck in the electoral. This particular moment is finely balanced. The situation is incredibly volatile the context unprecedented. Those who claim to know how things will turn out are simply revealing how little they actually know. Because the outcomes of elections are always of national significance, we tend to always treat them as national events – when sometimes they more closely resemble a range of electoral microclimates, each with its own ecosystem. This feels like one of those times.The truth is we don’t know who is going to win. But we do have a clear idea of why it matters. This election is about something: indeed in a sense it’s about everything. It offers as stark a choice in terms of the direction of the country, both at home and abroad, as most can remember.Unfortunately, on the issue that brought us to this point, Brexit, there may not be any clear resolution. The country has narrowly voted to do something it does not want to pay the price for doing, and which its polity has been unable to bring itself to do. The best many of us can hope for is to put whatever deal is done to a referendum and vote again. But whatever the result, that won’t resolve it. The country is horribly ided. We have voted ourselves into a mess and we’ll have to vote ourselves out of it.Pretty much every party in England and Wales has policies to deal with these issues that I can live with apart from one – the Conservatives. It’s not hard to see why they want to make this election about Brexit: they have nothing else. Their message is clear if nonsensical. “Get Brexit done” is no more a policy than “Brexit means Brexit” was a strategy. But beyond that, the best they can offer is to soften some of the worst of austerity while doubling down on the worst of everything else – from stop and search to shredding regulations.One scenario, among many, this time around is that the Conservatives lose votes, win a majority and get to pursue their agenda anyhow. That could be the story of the election: that a country with a majority opposed to the politics of poverty, greed, deregulation and austerity, a hard Brexit and entrenched inequality could not or would not unite, strategically, to prevent them. Fortunately there are a myriad of other possible stories, where we help feed our children and save the planet. We still have time to write them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f21634da5584847a093912fb1f5c2b515cb4ac81/0_198_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc3f6aadd7e1aa9e10c25f2573f78654","title":"rugby league conservatives sport elites","story":"Will the decisive battles of the 2019 general election be fought on the playing fields of the north of England? Maybe so, now that the Conservative thinktank Onward has identified so-called Workington Man and his “strong rugby league traditions” as a key target for Boris Johnson’s election campaign.The idea that “rugby league traditions” have anything in common with the Old Etonians in charge of Britain is laughable. Rugby league was actually born out of a radical revolt against the stranglehold of the privately educated over rugby. When huge numbers of industrial workers in the north of England took up rugby in the 1880s, the privately educated leaders of the Rugby Football Union tried to restrict access to the game by making it an amateur sport. “Why should we hand it over without a struggle to the hordes of working men players who would quickly engulf all others?” asked rugby and cricket international Frank Mitchell in 1897.But men working in mines, docks and factories had to take unpaid leave from work to play rugby. Amateurism meant they could not be compensated for the wages lost playing the game, so the northern rugby clubs proposed that players be given “broken time” payments.Rugby’s leaders refused. Threatened with expulsion, the top northern clubs broke away in 1895 to form the Northern Union, which would become known as rugby league.In response, RFU banned for life anyone connected with rugby league. Players were ostracised for even talking to rugby league officials. In no other sport was Britain’s class ide so starkly illustrated.Rugby league became a sport outside the establishment, with its own traditions of equality and democracy. Eddie Waring, the legendary commentator, hailed the sport as “the most democratic in the world”. Trade union leaders such as the miners’ Joe Gormley and TUC general secretary John Monks were regulars on the terraces of Wigan and Swinton.Rugby league also has a history of racial integration unique in British sport. In 1935 George Bennett became the first black international rugby league player, over 40 years before the first black English football international. In 1972 Clive Sullivan became the first black Briton to captain a national side, and led Great Britain to a world cup triumph.The sense that the game reflected wider social isions was highlighted during the 1984-85 miners’ strike, which was fought out in many towns and villages in the north where rugby league was the dominant sport. Rugby league clubs became organising centres for feeding and supporting striking miners and their families. When Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB tried to force clubs to merge after it bought the game’s TV rights in 1995, many of those who had been on the picket lines in 1984 once again turned out to protest. “They’ve taken our jobs, now they want to take away our leisure,” was how one demonstrator expressed their anger.The attitudes that gave birth to rugby league remain strong. Hostility to the establishment and suspicion of the ruling elite, whether in Westminster or in business, has not diminished. Indeed, the strong Brexit vote in rugby league-playing regions can be seen as a protest vote against a two-party parliamentary system that has continually let down the “post-industrial” north.Unlike Essex Man or Worcester Woman, Workington Man (Johnson’s consultants appear to be ignorant of the fact that women are also rugby league fans and players) has none of the advantages of living in the economic bubble of the south of England. While dissatisfaction with Labour also runs deep, it is unlikely that traditional rugby league areas in the north of England will fall to the Tories.Although the Brexit party has picked up votes in these areas, Nigel Farage’s Dulwich College accent and golf club-bore demeanour is too great a barrier for him to make any significant breakthrough in areas where stubborn resistance to self-appointed authority is deeply ingrained.As one contemporary writer remarked about the 1895 split, northern rugby and its communities had rejected the “thraldom of the southern gentry”. There’s no reason to suspect that things will change in 2019. As Onward’s misunderstanding of rugby league traditions demonstrates, Britain remains two nations separated by huge class and cultural isions. And few things illustrate that chasm better than rugby.• Tony Collins is emeritus professor of history at De Montfort University."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062e92e089021be3bd20bb1b7ad4a7c0c5e06f97/0_181_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac7c8a363bf8954a86eb237668488ea","title":"twitter mps social media political speech","story":"For over three years, parliament has been going around in circles, progressing to nowhere, consumed by debate about how to respond to the 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union. Despite a majority of current MPs voting in support of invoking article 50 and standing for election in 2017 on manifesto commitments to leave, a majority of them have been unwilling to allow Brexit to be delivered.This impasse has led to deep frustration in parliament and in wider society, creating isions within communities and families as well as among politicians. Brexit has poisoned civil debate. It’s a boil that needs to be lanced, which is why I’ve supported the prime minister’s decision to hold a general election, even though I’d like to have seen Brexit delivered first.However, I do think that the degree of poison and unpleasantness, and the threat to our political stability, is at risk of being exaggerated. The danger to iniduals and to civil society was much greater during the miners’ strike and the three-day week in 1974.There is no real threat to civil order in the current Brexit debate. Yes, the local police have called in to my office after concerns were raised about my safety. And along with many other MPs, I’ve had security measures installed in my constituency offices and at my home. But the reality is that it’s tiddlywinks compared with the abuse I received in 1997 when I stood as a Conservative candidate. I vividly remember being chased up a garden path by a political opponent with a pitchfork – and being attacked by a dog that destroyed a pair of my best campaign trousers. And I had to take evasive action to avoid being run down by an angry adversary in his Land Rover. Politics has always been a highly charged and occasionally brutal business. Today’s abuse is nothing new.The main reason that poison is increasingly seeping into our political discourse is the exponential growth of social media. In some ways it can be beneficial for public engagement – but the damage it causes outweighs the good. Anonymous comment posted by keyboard warriors, often with a total disregard for the truth, creates a cesspit of vileness – which is why I gave up on Twitter years ago. I haven’t missed it a bit.Twitter is also the deathbed of humour, because posts are often met with synthetic outrage when the intent of the writer was actually entirely benign. That’s why so much of what appears on Twitter is mind-numbingly boring. I used it for a while but stopped about two years ago in favour of Facebook, where debate is (mostly) constructive. Of course, people should be free to share their thoughts wherever they wish – but if you don’t enjoy it, just stop doing it.The plethora of protest movements that have grown over recent years have been organised largely on social media – and give the impression that the level of civil disorder has increased. There has indeed been more “noise”, but the level of threat and unpleasantness in our country is nothing like as bad as is being portrayed in the insatiable hunger to fill news space. Yet my advice to anyone who has had enough of the cacophony is to get off Twitter. You won’t regret it.• Glyn Davies is the Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3093250d276a88c36e3f4b17a0941ac3d6d5f0/0_34_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08a1ee6a88e7837eefdd57535b861ff0","title":"staffordshire hoard archaeologists academic research gold ornaments","story":"First major academic research finds ‘war hoard’ likely captured in battles between regional kingdomsWhen an amateur metal detectorist first heard his machine beep in an unpromising field in Lichfield in July 2009 and dug down to uncover gold, it was clear this was no ordinary archaeological discovery.But who had collected the astonishing stash of gold, garnet weapons and ornaments he had found? Why had they been buried? And why were so many of them broken?After a decade of conservation and analysis, archaeologists have finally revealed their conclusions about these tantalising questions and others, with the publication of the first major academic research into what became known as the Staffordshire hoard.What they have concluded, according to Chris Fern, the lead academic on the project, reaffirms the hoard’s significance as “without a doubt one of the greatest finds of British archaeology” and casts new light on one of the most turbulent periods of early English history.The archaeologists have even tentatively identified the Mercian king they believe may have once owned the booty, and can draw a tantalising link to the dynasty of the rival Anglo-Saxon ruler who was buried at Sutton Hoo, Britain’s most famous site of the period.Dating from the period AD600-AD650, when the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England were battling for prominence, the Staffordshire find is in essence a “war hoard”, says Fern, consisting of spectacular items the experts believe were captured in battle by armies from the kingdom of Mercia, at the expense of neighbouring Northumbria and East Anglia.The royal treasury was probably buried in haste at a time of turmoil, but for reasons that can only be guessed at, it was never reclaimed.It includes items that are unique, such as a large processional cross that offers convincing evidence, say the experts, that Christian items were being carried into battle in this period as talismans.A curious gold and garnet item, also without parallel and referred to for years as “the mystery object”, is now believed to have been a jewelled ornament that sat on top of a bishop’s headpiece. Both were deliberately bent and desecrated before being buried.Rather than being limited to the ruler, gold weapons “must have been relatively commonplace for the warrior class beneath the king”, he says. “The poetry of Beowulf talks about huge gold treasure hoards and dragon hoards, but we always thought that was poetic license.“What this hoard really shows us for the first time is a golden age in this period of Anglo-Saxon England – and I mean that literally. This was a period when gold was suddenly much more available, and was converted into beautiful objects for the warrior elite.”Much of the past decade has been spent making sense of thousands of tiny gold fragments – about 4,600 – which Fern describes as “a case of multiple jigsaw puzzles being tipped together, mixed up and some of the parts being removed”. Some years into the project, the experts realised they had pieces of a rare gold helmet, two replicas of which are housed in museums in Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent, which jointly own the hoard.But what of the hoard’s original owner? Certainly, there are clues. The treasure was buried in Mercia, what was to become the royal heartland of that kingdom, at a time when it was notching up significant martial victories over its neighbours.All of which may point in the direction of King Penda, who ruled Mercia for three decades until his death in AD655. Among the rivals he defeated and killed were the East Anglian kings Sigeberht and Anna, who were the stepson and nephew respectively of Raedwald, the East Anglian monarch who is believed to be buried at Sutton Hoo.“There’s nothing in the hoard that is stamped Penda Rex, sadly, so we can’t say for certain that it is Penda’s hoard,” says Fern, but it is “very plausible”, he adds with academic understatement, that the collection includes booty Penda seized from Raedwald’s immediate successors.For all the academics’ conclusions and occasionally “bold interpretations”, he stresses, the answers to many of the hoard’s questions will never be conclusively proven – “just as it is impossible with any great archaeological mystery to come up with an answer, unless you have a time machine. But that is part of the wonder of the hoard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48825651147a5299c13fec6918c0538656618e8/0_628_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8e6fa1a43734d72e1a05b8f709601c","title":"only in ottawa top 10 unmissable summertime experiences in canadas capital","story":"Summer visitors to Ottawa will be rewarded with a vibrant arts and outdoor scene, with galleries, festivals and waterways. Then there’s the beerOttawa is relaxed, but at the same time an adrenaline-seeker’s dream. It’s funky and kitsch and yet effortlessly cool with brewing, dining and arts scenes to rival anywhere in North America – and its absolute best comes in the summer months.Cruising the Rideau canalWhile Ottawa’s Rideau canal plays host to hundreds of daily ice skaters carving across its frozen surface during winter months, the Unesco world heritage site is just as appealing in summer. Jump aboard Rideau Canal Cruises’ fully electric barge – the only vessel of its kind in North America – and savour the perfect vantage point for some of Ottawa’s most scenic spots. You can take in Lansdowne Park and Dow’s Lake to the south and the gothic revival splendour of the Fairmont Château Laurier hotel closer to downtown.Political manoeuvring – with a twistZen can be found in surprising pockets of Ottawa but none more surprising than in its very epicentre – Parliament Hill. Inside the doors of the nation’s halls of power, things may be particularly frenetic with a federal election coming up this autumn, but on the lawn outside the stunning house of commons, things are decidedly more chill every Wednesday afternoon. The free weekly yoga class is an absolute must for yogis and non-yogis of all abilities. Even prime minister Justin Trudeau, an enthusiast himself, has stopped in at a class or two. Just bring a mat – and some sunscreen – and get your downward dog on while the politicians get their debate on inside.Brewing up a stormWhen former US president Barack Obama rekindled his bromance with Trudeau during a visit to the capital earlier this summer, it was pretty fitting that the pair caught up at a brewery. Ottawa is teeming with taphouses pouring out some of Canada’s best brews. Obama and Trudeau opted for Big Rig Brewing where they sampled the Canadian Amber and Alpha Bomb IPA respectively. But there is hoppy goodness to be found across the city. Beyond the Pale in Little Italy is a gem with great eats to soak up even better beers, while Canada’s first Kickstarter-funded brewery, Dominion City, is so worth the trip to the east end. Can’t decide between the options? Then let the experts at Brew Donkey guide you on an always-fun brewery bus tour.The best season? Patio seasonSummer is patio season. There’s nowhere better to enjoy those great local beers or some of the best cuisine in Canada than in the open air. The uber-stylish Andaz hotel in the ByWard Market may lay claim to the city’s best patio, a rooftop escape that offers stunning views. But there are scores of rivals. Tavern on the Falls boasts soothing waterfall views, while Tooth and Nail Brewing Co has a recently opened sun-kissed courtyard to go with great beers. The Brig Pub may have the most Insta-perfect open-air space of all – a canopy of hanging greenery that still leaves gaps for blue skies to pierce through.Sounds of summerThe capital reverberates to music all summer long. Bluesfest is the biggest and boldest festival of the summer and boasts much more than just blues. Headliners this year include the Killers, Alt-J, Wu-Tang Clan and the Backstreet Boys. But from June through to September there really is something for everyone: Escapade sates all EDM lovers’ appetites Chamberfest is the world’s biggest chamber music festival there are five days of fireworks at the Canadian Museum of History with the Sound of Light competition and, yes, there is also a 10-day jazz festival that features some of the world’s biggest acts.Please the palate at a walking paceOttawa’s food scene – a melting pot that bubbles over with flavours and aromas – is as erse as its population. The city ranges from award-winning fine dining to adventurous ethnic holes in the wall, with plenty in between. But there are so many funky new places opening up that wrangling them all in can seem like a challenge. So why not pass the job off to someone else by joining a walking food tour? C’est Bon Cooking offers great guides to the city’s food culture, snaking through the top foodie neighbourhoods. Centretown and The Glebe might be the most happening neighbourhoods right now.Waterways to pass the dayIf the blue lagoon part of the Goliath sounds appealing, but little else, then keep things upright and a little lower on the adrenaline scale by hitting the waterways that course around the city. With temperatures on the rise, the summer months in Ottawa are made for water lovers. You can take to the Rideau canal in your own personal vessel, with kayak, paddleboat, canoe and stand-up paddleboard (SUP) rentals all available at the marina at Dow’s Lake. Venture beyond the canal to either the Ottawa or Gatineau rivers. Urban Ocean may be the pick of some great rental and guide firms, offering the chance to SUP in the shadows of Parliament Hill or SUP yoga by the Ottawa locks.Live the high life … then dropNot everything has to be chill in Ottawa – there are thrills too. Nowhere does the adrenaline flow freer and faster than at the Rock. Just a 20-minute drive from downtown, this stunning limestone gorge is a site to behold but looks even better upside down. Great Canadian Bungee offers the highest fall on the continent of North America — fully 61 metres (200 feet) into the aquamarine lagoon below. Even the 49-metre (160-foot) rebound is higher than the next biggest bungee in the US or Canada! If you’re not feeling the urge, watching others drop below is a thrill in itself!Culture cravings satisfiedOttawa is not just the country’s political centre. It lays claim to being Canada’s museum and gallery capital too. The sprawling National Gallery of Canada finds room for almost 100,000 works, by a distance the country’s biggest. This summer’s highlight sees the world’s first-ever exhibition devoted to the portrait work of post-impressionist master Paul Gauguin. But make time for the Canadian and Indigenous galleries too, where the country’s cultural heritage can be traced back 5,000 years. At the Ottawa Art Gallery’s stunning new home – shared with Le Germain hotel – catch the Wrapped in Culture project, a powerful reclamation project between Indigenous artists from Canada and Australia.Go wildSo many summer visitors eschew Canadian cities and make straight for the great wilderness. Ottawa offers the best of both worlds. Drive even 10 minutes outside the city and you’ll find your natural paradise. Gatineau Park is over 350 sq kms of green goodness and yet its main entrance is just 4km from downtown. Hike to the Pink Lake lookout where the deepest aqua-green waters ensure that no filter is required for the perfect selfie. There are trails for all levels of hikers, and rookies and experts alike should finish up at the genteel 1900s surrounds of the Mackenzie King Estate, where tea and scones at the former residence of Canada’s longest-serving prime minister are just reward for the hike.Explore all Canada’s capital has to offer with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3f7e5e587883057275ab322ed2a7bab2cb8f88/0_200_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0934396a1fcb20fb5ccb680372b62200","title":"10 unmissable autumn experiences in ontario","story":"Visit Ontario in the autumn and you’ll discover food festivals, migrating birds and a kaleidoscope of foliage colour. Relax at Muskoka or fly to Frying Pan Island for its famous local fish and chipsOntario explodes into colour in autumn as the lush greens of spring and summer give way to the reds and golds and scorched orange and browns that are the hallmarks of the harvest time. The best time to see the autumn colours is from mid-September to mid-October when Ontario Parks publishes a colour report on its site of the autumn colours across the province. As you can imagine, the colours vary, depending on your location. In truth there is no better time to hit the road, get out of the city and soak up the kaleidoscope of change for a true Canadian autumn adventure.The natural heart of the provinceNowhere do the seasons change with as much vivid, coursing colour as in Algonquin provincial park. There are more than 100 provincial parks in Ontario, but none can rival Algonquin for popularity. Why? Because it lives up to the hype … and then some. Almost 3,000 square miles – a bigger expanse of land than Luxembourg – of unspoiled natural wilderness, the park is located between Toronto and Ottawa and is less than three hours’ drive from either city. Camp under the tapestry of stars or rent a ranger cabin for some rustic comfort. But, at first light, get out and catch the rich red maples and blinding yellow aspen trees in all their swing season glory.Pull up a chair in MuskokaIf Algonquin is Ontario’s natural centre, then the nearby Muskoka region is its relaxation hub. When Torontonians speak wistfully of a need to get out of the city to “cottage country” it’s likely that the Muskoka region is on their mind. From Insta-perfect tiny cabins to multi-million dollar lake homes, Muskoka has the full gamut of getaway options, almost all of them carving out a corner of tranquility among the pretty towns that pepper the region. A buzzing food scene, great breweries, spas and golf courses – the area has everything. Most of all though, it’s made for lounging lakeside in a low-slung Muskoka chair and forgetting about city life.Why 1,000 Islands make for a delightful trip …Head upstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach the 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and American border. A lazy but so rewarding cruise of the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence is not to be missed, with stunning seasonal views guaranteed. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originating here.… Or up the ante with 30,000 IslandsIf you’re a go big or go home type then please don’t go home. Ontario offers a supersized island experience on the eastern shore of Georgian Bay as speckled out from Parry Sound lie the 30,000 Islands. The largest freshwater archipelago in the world, the islands can be enjoyed on water or, if you’re in the mood to splurge, by air. Georgian Bay Airways offers outstanding tours of the Unesco biosphere reserve, including one that stops in at Henry’s, a fish and chip shop that serves up the local delicacy – battered pickerel – on the quite brilliantly named Frying Pan Island, which can only be visited by plane or boat.Give the Highlands a flingJust three hours north-east of Toronto, the Haliburton Highlands offer some of the most spectacular trails and lookout points in the province – especially during the autumn colour season. In late September the four-day Hike Haliburton festival is the largest annual hiking gathering in the entire country. As the tree canopy really begins to find its best burnt crimson, climb the Dorset Lookout Tower and have your breath taken away by the panoramic visions from the top. Once your trail is finished, rest weary limbs and quench that thirst at the Lake of Bays Brewing Company in Baysville to the west.All aboard for northern exposureThe expanses of Ontario that stretch northwest from Georgian Bay can seem intimidatingly vast. But they needn’t be. Sault Ste Marie, a steel town on the rebound with some real gems among the rebirth, is a great starting point for a northern excursion. The rugged appeal of northern Ontario may be best taken in on the Agawa Canyon Tour Train, a journey into the wilderness on tracks that hug the sides of lakes and traverse rivers on their way through towering rock outcrops. Just make sure to book a window seat.A capital ideaNot the provincial capital – that honour falls to Toronto – Ottawa more than makes up for it as the epicentre of national governance. But better to leave the indoor stuff to the politicians because autumn is arguably when Canada’s capital city is at its most charming. Take a paddle along the Rideau Canal (before it freezes over for the winter) to get the best views of some of the city’s autumn foliage.Feast on the fruits of harvest seasonYou can quite literally wade into the riches of Ontario’s agricultural output as harvest season gets into full swing. Strap up your chest waders and take the plunge in Bala, Ontario’s cranberry capital. Autumn fairs crop up across Ontario as the boundless bounty of produce piles up. From the Pumpkinfest in Port Elgin to Oktoberfests across the province’s south-east, tis the season to e right in. Food festivals are popular across the province, and run the spectrum from sweet to savoury. Anything from blueberries, strawberries, peaches, apples and cherries can be found. Ribfests, garlic, bacon fests or buttertarts also feature.Wine for the winding roadThe Bruce Trail is the longest and oldest trail in the country and winds its way more than 550 miles north from Niagara Falls to Tobermory, Ontario. An entire section of the trail snakes along some of the spectacular cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment and other sections along the route make for nice day hikes. It would be a sin not to visit during the Niagara Grape and Wine festival, a two-week toast to the region’s finest tipples in September. It’s Canada’s biggest wine festival and a Discovery Pass pairs the wines with some of the best of the region’s vaunted cuisine.Heading south before the next seasonAutumn is not just moving season for farmers. Some of Ontario’s native fauna are getting their act together too. Upwards of 300 bird species begin to pack up and head south to avoid the winter, while hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies do likewise. The great migrations are perhaps best witnessed at Point Pelee national park, less than an hour from the border with Michigan and the best time to catch the birdlife is mid-September.Start planning your visit to Ontario this autumn with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7b12462f58d578b58360f4db6e4dfb7c47d442/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce0bf1e7b7d972a2e08cb3c63c6475d","title":"from fringe theatre to walking on water 10 experiences that make alberta unique","story":"Alberta is a breathtakingly beautiful province. Home to the Canadian Rockies, farmland for miles (and miles and miles), all-season escapades, and a friendly and erse population, it’s a great place to get a whole lot of adventure for your moneyWalk on (frozen) water at Maligne CanyonStrap on your ice cleats and get ready for an afternoon journey through the frozen Maligne Canyon. During the summer months, visitors pass high over the canyon on a series of bridges, but once the river freezes over, the real adventure becomes possible. Trek over the ice and into the frozen depths of the canyon, and witness sheer icy cliffs on either side of the path – you’ll have definitely earned a mug of hot chocolate by the end.Become a fringe theatre fanatic in EdmontonFirst-timers at Edmonton International Fringe Theatre festival are often surprised to learn that Alberta’s unassuming capital city hosts the second-largest fringe theatre festival in the world (after Edinburgh). Those in the know, however, can attest to the massively fun explosion of wackiness and dramatic creativity that add colour and life to Edmonton’s hip Old Strathcona neighbourhood for 10 days each August.See Indigenous history at Writing-on-Stone provincial parkAlberta’s most recently minted Unesco world heritage site, Writing-on-Stone provincial park, is near the southern border in the area known as the Canadian Badlands. Tall, imposing rock formations called hoodoos populate the plains near the Milk River. On the rock walls are carvings and drawings that record the dreams and stories of the Áísínai’pi (Blackfoot) people, who have been in the area for the past 10,000 years. You need a guide to take you out to the art on the stone – book online to reserve your spot.Challenge yourself with the Crypt Lake Hike in WatertonThe trailhead of the Crypt Lake Hike in Waterton national park is accessed by boat, which is the first clue that this is not just going to be a walk in the park. Follow the trail up the mountain (approximately three hours each way) past four alpine waterfalls over a loop that runs roughly 11 miles. Avid hikers are, of course, drawn to the trail for the challenge of negotiating obstacles such as the 60-metre tunnel through the mountain – but it is the thrilling cliffside stretch near the top, which features stunning views down the ravine of the crystal-clear blue Crypt Lake, that truly makes this adventure something special.Photograph ice bubbles at Abraham LakeSometimes nature does some trippy things, like make a lake that freezes with bubbles in it. Decomposing matter forms methane bubbles in Abraham Lake in central Alberta. When it’s really cold, the bubbles get trapped in the ice rather than bursting at the surface. High winds can polish the ice and clear the snow away, making for perfect bubble viewing conditions.Go underground with a Canmore Cave TourJust outside Banff national park is the town of Canmore. It has all the trappings of a charming mountain community, plus a little extra: Rat’s Nest Cave. The name is straight out of a horror movie, but a tour of Rat’s Nest – one of Canada’s longest caves – is a perfectly safe way to get your thrills. Challenge yourself with the four-hour Adventure tour, or for something more moderate opt for the two-hour Explorer tour. If you are feeling extra adventurous you can book a private “solitude” experience.View larch trees in Banff and KananaskisEastern larches, a variety of pine also known as tamaracks, turn a deep golden yellow or rich copper for a short season – generally mid-September to mid-October – before dropping their needles for the winter. Pack a bright coat to pop against the colours in photos and head out to viewing hotspots like the Sentinel Pass in Banff’s aptly named Larch Valley, or the more easily accessible Chester Lake in Kananaskis country outside Calgary.Play palaeontologist at the Royal Tyrell MuseumDedicated to all things dinosaur, the Royal Tyrell Museum is Canada’s home of palaeontology, featuring one of the world’s largest collections of dinosaur displays alongside more than 130,000 fossils and an unbeatable programme of special exhibits and interactive learning experiences. Located just an hour-and-a-half drive out of Calgary, the Royal Tyrell Museum offers a great day trip out of Alberta’s largest city for people of all ages, not just kids.Touch the top of the world in Lake LouiseIf skiing isn’t your cup of tea, or you need a break from carving down the mountain, the Lake Louise Ski Resort offers a different kind of alpine experience – snowshoeing! Book a tour with a guide who will lead you off-piste for a peaceful snowbound hike around the summit, taking in panoramic views of some of the most stunning scenery in the Canadian Rockies from the spectacular vantage points dotted across the trail.Star gaze in Wood Buffalo national parkIn the far north of the province, with an area larger than Switzerland, lies the largest national park in Canada, Wood Buffalo national park. It is also the world’s largest dark sky preserve, making it the perfect spot to escape light pollution and star gaze or hunt for northern lights. With about 18 hours of daylight in the summer months, you will need to be a night owl to stay up for the show, or consider a visit in the autumn, winter or spring.So what are you waiting for?

In France, it made her a sex-symbol to rival Bardot, and her stunning beauty and style achieve something almost extraterrestrial here. She plays Barbarella, an intrepid space adventurer who is entrusted with a vital intergalactic mission by the president of Earth, which involves nursing a blind angel on a distant planet by having sex with him. Fonda carries it off with dedication and style.This satire is, in some ways, a companion piece to her 1967 comedy Barefoot in the Park. It’s a critique of the American dream, which mockingly distorts the picture-book perfection of family life portrayed in the well-known Dick and Jane children’s books, which taught generations of Americans how to read while also perhaps schooling them in conformist attitudes. Dick and Jane are played by George Segal and Fonda, a well-off couple in a lovely home who turn to crime when he becomes unemployed. The film manages to be a spin on Bonnie and Clyde while also playing on Fonda’s own radical image. She has a bizarre broad-comedy scene in which she falls over while doing some amateur fashion modelling in a hotel dining room, causing mayhem.This extraordinary cameo, hardly more than a few minutes of screen time, is destined to become one of Fonda’s most cult performances. She plays Brenda Morel, a renowned, difficult, ageing movie actor. (There’s a PhD to be written on how older female stars only get his kind of self-parodic role in films.) She furiously berates a director (Harvey Keitel) who is trying to cast her in his new film, and, in an extraordinary scene on an aeroplane, we see her succumb to a full-scale temper tantrum that involves her screaming: “You fucking bitches!” and hitting a flight attendant before having a catastrophic hairpiece malfunction.Neil Simon adapted his Broadway hit for this movie, which was a key moment in Fonda’s early success during the run of frothy metropolitan comedies that made her name. It’s easy to forget how excellent she was – and is – playing comedy, with a droll lilt to her line readings she puts the free-spirited zing into this movie, which was clearly conscious of being a bit squaresville for its day. She is Corie, a newlywed (that very dated notion) married to super-handsome but conventional Paul (played by Robert Redford, one of the few Hollywood men who could match Fonda for beauty) and yearning for him to loosen up and go frolicking in the park barefoot (a signifier for further bareness?).Fonda became a star to take seriously in this shocking movie about the Great Depression directed by Sydney Pollack. It’s a grim metaphor for the exploitation and suffering of working people, and can be seen as a forerunner of our obsession with reality TV and social-media cruelty. The setting is a dance marathon in the 1930s, in which poverty-stricken people pair up to dance for days on end – stumbling around like miserable zombies in front of a jaded and sadistic audience – hoping to be the last couple standing for a big cash prize. Fonda plays Gloria, apparently the most cynical and ruthless contestant in the running, but dealing with an inner hurt.Neil Simon gave Fonda another great comic role in this bittersweet portmanteau movie, in which she plays a tough New York professional who flies into Los Angeles on a mission to confront her screenwriter ex-husband (Alan Alda) because their teenage daughter wants to live with him, not her. She has a great confrontation scene with Alda, simmering with contempt, hauteur and a strange unresolved attraction for her ex. The film is often noted for the fact that Fonda looks sensational in a bikini – this was the seed for her bestselling workout videos. She also looks great in glasses.This 50-minute film essay about a famous news photo of Fonda meeting Vietnamese communists in Hanoi in 1972 is directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. It was originally intended as an archly ironic postscript to Godard’s film Tout Va Bien, which also came out that year (and in which Fonda acted, but fell out with the director). Letter to Jane is simply a deconstructionist essayharangue, narrated by Godard and Gorin, critiquing the photo of Fonda, and also US leftism and Hollywood stardom.Fonda had that rare thing, a female co-star billing in this smart feminist workplace comedy, in which she plays Judy, who has to get a job in a huge corporate office after her husband runs off with another woman. Like her co-workers Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, she is oppressed, harassed and exploited by her unspeakable male boss. This is an interesting role for Fonda, who is not cast as the overtly funny character nor the explicitly sexy one. Rather, she personifies a kind of benchmark normality. Yet there is something notably powerful and real in an opening scene in which she is yelled at because she doesn’t know how to work a particular piece of equipment a moment that crystallises her rage.This is one of Fonda’s most courageous and heartfelt performances, which won her a second Oscar. It is also tied up with her activities as anti-Vietnam war campaigner. She plays the wife of a US Marine Corps officer (Bruce Dern) who leaves for service in Vietnam. Left behind, she finds volunteer work in a veterans’ hospital and befriends a wheelchair user played by Jon Voight. They begin a relationship that culminates in a sex scene – notably forthright in its day – in which Fonda’s character experiences the first orgasm of her life. It’s a movie that was overshadowed by the more macho take offered by The Deer Hunter – but it’s a fine performance from Fonda.Here is the quintessential Fonda performance, in Alan J Pakula’s psychological thriller: she is smart, beautiful, tough and haunted – in a film that, like Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation, embodies a proto-Watergate fear of being spied upon. And Fonda provides a new spin on the classic “shady lady” figure that always shows up in noir movies. She is Bree Daniels, a would-be model and actor who is doing escort work to pay the bills. Donald Sutherland plays Klute, the private detective spying on her because a serial killer is on the loose, and she is in danger. Fonda’s character is cool and reserved, having apparently mastered a kind of emotional numbness as part of the play-acting involved in her work, and part of her genuine alienation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b950ae54736d75f5bb9e883c95bd25a737b13a0/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1664554a4e79ee8a0cc6cbfd16a12a03 480w","title":"nicklas bendtner book extract arsenal academy henry","story":"At the Arsenal academy it is like I have come to a different world. I have to get used to no longer being the best in my age group. Here, suddenly, there is a lot of competition.The worst bit is Tuesdays and Thursdays when we have lessons. It is like being back at school. We have all sorts of different subjects, such as press management and financial management. I thought I was done with studying and if it is possible I hate it even more than back at Amager.He has heard a story about how I was hiding underneath a table. That’s not true and I tell him that with a clear conscience: “Honestly Mr Brady, I haven’t been hiding underneath a table. This is one big misunderstanding.”That is not the only clash. Underneath Brady we have David Court. After a few months it is clear that I have got under his skin. Court can’t stand me. He can’t hide his contempt. One day I turn up wearing a baseball cap. He rips it off me and throws it on the floor and starts stamping on it with both feet simultaneously. It is like something out of a cartoon and against my own will I start to snigger. Then he shouts and jumps a bit more.When he is done I collect my cap and walk on to the dressing room. He is surely trying to put me in my place. I have to realise that I am a little shit, a big fat zero, as long as I am still at the academy and not with the first team that is his message.It’s November 2004 and the problems are mounting. I have shot up length-wise in the past few years. I am no longer one of the smallest. Rather the contrary, I have gone past 1m 90cm and I am still growing. My back is protesting as it can’t keep up. It is something to do with the nerves at the bottom of my back.One day I am called into Liam Brady’s office. I don’t expect anything to be wrong because Arsène Wenger has praised me several times when I have been training with the first team. I am wrong, though.“Look, son,” he says. “I don’t think you understand what is at stake here, and how many boys would give their right arm to have the chance you have now. I think simply that you are not ready.”I get a long speech. That I was a big fish in a small pond in Denmark. That I look at football as something I am automatically best at. That I shouldn’t be thinking about cars, expensive watches and model girlfriends. That is something you get when you deserve it and that the only way there is hard work.He is staring right at me as he talks to me. His gaze doesn’t deviate an inch. I try to stare back, to show that I am strong, but I can also feel that my eyes are welling up. My mouth opens and I can hear my own voice. I am agreeing with him. Even though I am doing more than OK I am a long way from being outstanding.“I know full well that you saw another player in Denmark but don’t drop me. It will come,” I say. Brady looks at me with a calm but penetrating gaze. “I am not sure, Nicklas. And it is not good enough to have doubt. Not at this level. You are going back to Copenhagen,” he says. “No I am not,” I say and start to cry. It is the first time I have cried in front of someone else than my parents. And suddenly I realise how much I want this. That Arsenal is my dream and that I am about to shatter the only plan I have ever made for myself. “I promise you that my attitude will change. You are going to see the real Nicklas Bendtner, I promise that,” I say.That is what he wants to hear and we agree on a compromise. I am going home to Otto Liebes Allé to rest my back and have a proper think to see if I am ready to sacrifice what is needed.In May 2005 I am able to sum up my first year in an Arsenal shirt. Since Brady threatened to cancel my contract I have made big strides forward. I have scored 12 goals in 18 games for the under-18s and five goals for the reserves. Increasingly I am training with the first team every week and sometimes I forget that I am just on trial with the big boys. During one session we are playing 11 v 11 with a maximum of two touches at a time. I am standing in a position to see Thierry Henry touching it three times. “Three touches,” I shout. Wenger’s assistant, Pat Rice, shouts back: “Play on, for fuck’s sake!”But Henry has heard me. He turns in my direction and puts his finger over his lips: “Sssssssh.” Shortly afterwards I do the same. The ball touches my heel, and then my toe before I pass it on. It is one movement but the academy player gets a free-kick against him. Of course I do. I don’t think. I just start complaining, big time. I say it should be the same for everyone.Henry tells me to shut up, this time with a lot of swear words included. And in hindsight it is good advice. But I am not taking it on. I shout back that he is the one who should shut up. He runs in my direction, confronts me, yells into my face, says all kinds of things. He totally ignores the fact that the game is going on around us.Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell get involved: “Carry on, Nicklas, keep on running and shut your mouth.”And I do. I become unusually calm. That is what happens if one of the best forwards in the world stands there and shouts at you.But that is not the end of it. After training Henry comes after me. We start talking, first in the dressing room and then in the players’ lounge. I didn’t know that he had that many words in him but he does. It is a two‑hour soliloquy about everything that is needed to get to where one wants to get. For me it is an honour. It is nice of him and not something he had to do. I soak everything up and it ends with us hugging each other.I think that’s that and that it has been dealt with. But it is not. The next month I don’t train with the first team. Not a single time. Half a year later, when I am back with the first team, I nearly start something similar again. This time it is me against Gilberto Silva. The Brazilian shouts that I should pull my finger out. He is arguably the world’s nicest man but I forget that in the heat of the moment. Instinctively I think that he should taste the same medicine, that he should shut up, but thankfully I manage to stop myself. I can still hear it: “Shut the fu … Yes-yes, Gilberto!”When it comes to choosing my agent I am more and more leaning towards a guy with Indian heritage. Ashley Cole has good things to say about him but that is not the decisive factor in the end. It just feels right to work with someone who doesn’t constantly preach common sense and long-term career planning. I hear enough about that at the academy.David Manasseh stands for something different. He is very matey even if there must be 20 years between us. Always keen on a good time. I need people like that in my life, in London as well. Even if I have some friends in the reserves – Fabrice Muamba and Johan Djourou – it can’t really compare to my time at the Danish club KB. People are not as warm here. They only think about the things that could get in the way of their dream. Not about living the dream. That is my big aim, even if that is some way away at the moment.Manasseh has expensive habits and it is a great change of environment when he picks me up in his big Bentley and drives us to one of London’s best restaurants. He knows about all the places that I hear about in the first-team changing room where I, against all rules, sneak in after training.The more I listen to them the more tempted I get. My first chat with Manasseh is at the most expensive hotel in St Albans. He says a lot of the right things. Things that I obviously want to hear when I am fighting to break through.“You have everything you need,” he says. “No one in England has your potential.” I like the guy and his big arm movements. When we sign our contract he invites me to Nobu to celebrate. Nobu is the latest fad. Japanese cuisine meets French and at the end of the evening it turns into a bar and night club. “This is the place to be,” as Manasseh puts it.I don’t know if that is my agent’s responsibility. But if it is my best that he wants then it is not particularly clever to introduce me to places such as Nobu. Because a few years later, when I have money, that’s where I go all the time.With one reserve game to go I have scored 16 goals to Arturo Lupoli’s 17. Even if I have supplied a lot of assists, many of them proper gifts to Lupoli, that is not ideal. Manasseh agrees: “You should end the season as top scorer, Nicklas. That will make everything easier.”So I go into the last game of the season with a promise to myself: I will try to finish anything that moves myself. We are playing West Ham away. They are at the bottom end of the table and we are third. In the first half I go against my own promise and give an assist to Seb Larsson. However, I get my own chances and score two goals to overhaul Lupoli at the top of the goalscoring charts.I have just turned 18 and I am the top scorer for Arsenal’s reserves. That looks good on paper.Nicklas Bendtner’s book is published by Politikens Forlag and is out in Danish on 5 November.

The club are preparing a €15m offer to be sent to Old Trafford next week, consisting of €12m up front and €3m in add-ons. They have already paid the Premier League club €3m for the loan this season.Roma have a five-year contract ready to offer to the player and will now wait to see if Manchester United accept their bid. Smalling had fallen behind Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelöf in the pecking order at Old Trafford and was battling with Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe to be the third-choice centre-back before going out on loan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/771033a39d680fa340575e8e56247576ddb51ada/0_64_3836_2301/master/3836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=048a02223a15e3f08dc5324366bd3799","title":"premier league team news injury updates manchester united liverpool chelsea live","story":"Some fulsome praise from Brendan Rodgers for midfielder Wilfred Ndidi. “He is an incredible player. The offensive players get the credit but he does the dirty work,” cooed Rodgers. “He has this brain for the game, where he can smell danger and always finds himself there. The timing of his challenge is very good and he’s up there with the top players at winning the ball back. When you play a pressing game you need someone like Wilf. His passing is good too, he’s always smiling.” Good to know he smiles a lot but the stats also confirm what his boss says. Ndidi has made more interceptions (32) than anyone in the Premier League this season and ranks second for tackles (45).Brendan Rodgers hasn’t been sat in his underpants at home, rewinding the goals in Leicester’s 9-0 win at Southampton whilst chewing through a bag of Haribo Fantasy Mix. Oh, no. The Foxes boss has resisted any such temptations to bask. “No, we’ve already had a game (3-1 Carabao Cup win at Burton). We’ve already reflected on the performance, you have got to take the real positives from it. There were other areas where we could have scored more, there was a period between the 58th minute and the 84th minute where we didn’t score. Throughout the game our pressing, our intensity, was very good and it shows the players have learned.” Some news from Scotland now, where Celtic are preparing to take on Hibs in the Betfred Cup semi-final at Hampden Park on Saturday. It looks as if they’ll have to do so without skipper Scott Brown, who is struggling with a thigh strain. Then again, there’s a fair chance they’ll cope having won the last nine domestic trophies on offer in Scotland. Lennon isn’t resting on his laurels, though, and wants to extend that run into double figures and beyond: “It is part of the domestic trophy haul we have kept hold of for the last three years. The players are highly motivated to defend the trophy, they are in great form, so there is a lot of incentive there for us.” Let me be Frank with you - to quote cult comedian Frankie Tan. Anyway, here are some bog-standard ‘respect the opposition’ quotes from Frank Lampard, uttered in complete sincerity despite his rampant young Chelsea bucks being ruthless on the road (four straight Premier League away wins 16 goals scored in the process) and ready to create more havoc at winless Watford: “We saw what they did last year, getting big results and regularly being a very strong team and making the FA Cup final. We cannot underestimate the team that will be hurting because they haven’t won for a while and will have every ambition to try and win this game, so I certainly have even more focus on what we need to do.”Thanks Ben. I’ll open with some Everton teams news. Marco Silva will make a late call on defender Yerry Mina ahead of the home game against Spurs on Sunday. The Colombian was forced off with a knee problem in the first half of the Toffees’ 2-0 Carabao Cup win over Watford on Tuesday. “He worked with the team this morning. It was nothing serious, what he has in his knee at this moment. It’s just a matter of him having the conditions to support the pain he has in this moment,” said Silva. “If he can do that, he can train and possibly he can play as well. Today he did in the morning all the session, let’s see how he will react tomorrow and after we will take the decisions. We hope it’s nothing really special and it looks nothing special.”There was certainly nothing special about Everton’s performance in this fixture last season as Tottenham ran riot to win 6-2.Righto, David Tindall will guide you through the rest of the goings-on in the Premier League and beyond. Brendan Rodgers and Marco Silva are still to come.Granit Xhaka may not be signed up for the Wolves game but it’s not all bad news for Arsenal: after two assists in midweek, Unai Emery says Mesut Özil and Gabriel Martinelli are ready to “help” on Saturday. “We are playing a lot of matches and for them it is a challenge each match to show how they are and how they can help us,” Emery said. “The performance on Wednesday in Liverpool was positive. I am thinking how they can help us tomorrow.” There would be a few solutions possible but there was not one day where Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League, the Football League and the other leagues sit at a table and think about the players and not about their wallet.Pep Guardiola has sent Eddie Jones his best wishes, with the Manchester City manager wishing the England rugby union coach good luck in the World Cup final against South Africa on Saturday. Jones has previously studied Guardiola’s coaching techniques. “Good luck,” Guardiola said. “It’s an honour for England to be in the final. For Eddie Jones, for his staff, for his players. All the best. It’s an incredible event.”There has been speculation this week that the Premier League may be set to ban under-12 players at academies from heading the ball, following a landmark report studying dementia in former players. Bournemouth have already acted to stop heading at their academy and Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was asked about the proposal during his press conference ahead of the away trip to Everton. It is a sensitive subject and we need to stay open to help the people that can provide us the better information and advice. We need to be open and try to provide the best to our kids because they are the future of football, the country, life and world. It is a sensitive thing that we need to listen to people that have the knowledge.”Emery looks pretty weary and seems unsure how best to cope with the storm surrounding Xhaka. He leans forward and says he does not plan to involve Xhaka against Wolves at the Emirates and it is difficult to envisage that changing. After being jeered off against Crystal Palace, the Swiss midfielder said he “reached boiling point” as a result of threats to his wife and daughter. Xhaka has started all but one of Arsenal’s league games this season:More from Unai Emery on Xhaka-gate:Pochettino says Dele Alli needs support, and not stick: We need to remember that he’s so young and the pressure is massive. He’s English and everybody expects big things from him but he’s still 23 years old. He was fantastic then he dropped a bit in his performance but we must back him. We have to pay attention, to focus and try to improve in the way that everyone expects.”Roma are keen on making Chris Smalling a permanent addition:Chelsea team news: Frank Lampard says Antonio Rüdiger is not fit and that the defender has an appointment with a consultant on Monday, with a view to sussing out a pelvic problem. N’Golo Kanté is closing on a return but this weekend comes too early for the France midfielder. “Ross Barkley is still not quite right, he’s not far away. Andreas Christensen is pretty much fit as well, so it’s the finishing touches for a few of these ones. There is a difference between fit and match-fit.”Give this a whirl:Pep Guardiola says he sympathises with Jürgen Klopp, who has said elite players are simply playing too much football. “I’m completely with Jurgen when he makes these statements, it’s too much,” he says. “If we have bigger squads, how do we pay them? We need less fixtures, less competitions, more recovery. But I have been in meetings and it’s always the same. We just talk about it. I had to prioritise Ilkay Gündogan for the last game – no Kevin de Bruyne, no David Silva. Other clubs do the same.”Unai Emery says his club captain will not play a part.Mauricio Pochettino is not a happy bunny. The Tottenham manager says he is “not happy” with Argentina calling up of Giovani Lo Celso, who has only just returned to the Spurs fold after picking up a muscle injury on international duty in September. Meanwhile, Jan Vertonghen is a doubt for Sunday’s game at Everton with a hamstring injury. Érik Lamela remains injured after missing the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool, while Danny Rose will miss out through suspension.Hodgson says Andros Townsend is unlikely to be fit for Sunday after sustaining a muscle strain against Arsenal. “Leicester are coming in off the back of two good results – last weekend and the Carabao Cup,” Hodgson said. “We hope they don’t play like they did against Southampton.” You can say that again Roy ...Roy Hodgson is in talks over extending his Crystal Palace stay, with a contract that will take him beyond his 73rd birthday. Hodgson, who turned 72 in August, is out of contract next summer but the club are keen to hand him a new deal following Palace’s good start to the season. Palace, who host high-flying Leicester on Sunday, are sixth after the opening 10 Premier League matches. “I heard today that Donald Trump who is a bit older than me is planning to stay on as President of the USA for another five years,” Hodgson said. “It’s an important job, but not quite as important as being the leader of the free world.”Manchester United are offering free flights to fans for their Europa League game at Khazakstan’s Astana in late November, following Thomas Cook’s insolvency. A spokesperson said: “We have been working through a range of contingency plans to minimise the impact of the Thomas Cook situation for our supporters. We are pleased to be able to confirm that Manchester United will be operating a complimentary trip to the forthcoming match against FC Astana in Kazakhstan for those who were impacted by the insolvency of Thomas Cook.”Klopp has told the game’s bigwigs to think “about the players and maybe not their wallet” when it comes to fixture congestion. The German said he does not want to be drawn over whether clubs simply play too many games ... and then ends up flowing into a mild-mannered and passionate rant of sorts: The discussion is obvious, that it is too much. Everyone involved in the game knows. Nobody wants to touch it, nobody really discusses about it. Then Uefa decides to make the Nations League, give the successful players a couple of more intense games. People then say you need a bigger squad. The game is not made for bigger squads. At the moment there is a imbalance between the number of players in the squad, the competitions you play and a big gap between the breaks the boys need. They have two weeks off a year, in a physically demanding game. The solutions, I think there are a few possible, but the leagues have to sit and really discuss and think about the players and maybe not their wallet. We discuss it always on the back of the money we earn. Somebody has to think about how many games.”Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to make his 100th Liverpool appearance against Aston Villa on Saturday and Klopp has been effusive in his praise of the England defender, who turned 21 last month. Klopp says it’s a pleasure to work with him: He’s so young and already so experienced. It’s a wonderful story for different reasons. I know that in Liverpool everyone was desperate to have a ‘scouse’ hero making his way into the first team. When he made his first appearance he said ‘great, but it’s not about having one game, it’s about having 100’. Now we can talk about that, and there was not a lot of bad games in that 100. I wish for him to stay healthy and fit, and then the future’s bright for him and for us. He’s a great role model. He’s relaxed about that but feels responsible as well.”Right, let’s get a load of Jürgen Klopp. The Liverpool boss says Naby Keïta is a doubt to face Aston Villa, while the defender Joël Matip is still a few weeks away from returning to action. On the subject of fixture congestion in December, Klopp says the club is yet to find a solution and could send select different squads for the Carabao Cup and Club World Cup games, if need be:Where did it all go wrong for Nathan Jones? We haven’t got all day, but here are a few pointers to get the ball rolling. After 14 games, only Barnsley’s inferior goal difference prevented the most expensively assembled squad in the Championship – at more than £143m – from sitting bottom of the pile. There are more than £50m-worth of players out on loan, including the club’s £18.3m record signing, Giannelli Imbula, and Kevin Wimmer, for whom they paid £18m, indicators of where this malaise began. There will be a slew of press conferences to get stuck into shortly but first: confirmation that Stoke have indeed sacked Nathan Jones. Stoke say they will make a new managerial appointment “as swiftly as possible” but, until then, Rory Delap, Kevin Russell and Andy Quy will take caretaker charge. “I would like to thank John and Peter Coates, firstly for the opportunity to manage this football club and then for the continued support and patience throughout my time here,” Jones said in a statement. “I would also like to thank the supporters for their fantastic support. Finally, I wish the club the very best for the future.”Jürgen Klopp will be chewing the fat shortly. The Liverpool manager will likely be waxing lyrical about the several youngsters that shone, and kept their cool, in the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal on Wednesday. It was a memorable occasion for Curtis Jones, Neco Williams and Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg, while the 20-year-old goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher was arguably the hero on the night. Rhian Brewster was also involved. Whether any youngsters feature at Villa Park on Saturday remains to be seen – it feels unlikely – but all enhanced their reputations.What more could you want?How high can Leicester go this season? The sense seems to be that it will again be a two-horse race for the title, with Liverpool out in front, closely followed by Manchester City but Brendan Rodgers’s side, and indeed Chelsea, are not so far behind. As Dean Smith said before Aston Villa were swept aside last weekend, City are not infallible and Liverpool, too, are not flawless. When Rodgers was asked about odds on his side winning the league shortening to around 501 following their 9-0 demolition of Southampton, he smiled and said: “We just want to finish as high as possible and I’d never put any limits on that.” Leicester travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday in search of a fourth straight win.Jürgen Klopp, Mauricio Pochettino and Unai Emery will be chatting a little later but, until then, a quick glance at the Championship. Bottom club Barnsley host Bristol City at Oakwell in Friday only’s game, before a bumper Saturday, with Derby taking on Middlesbrough and Leeds entertaining QPR. Then second-placed Preston travel to Charlton on Sunday. Amazingly, Preston’s entire starting XI last time out cost a grand total of ... £1.6m:How about these for grand plans? Crystal Palace are determined to tap into the hotbed of south London talent by building a £20m academy centre. In today’s Rumour Mill, Palace are credited with an interest in Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster but, down the line, maybe they will develop their own striking prodigy:Solskjær has heralded the October international break as a key factor in easing Manchester United back to form. The Norwegian says it was a much-needed breather before earning a draw against Premier League pacesetters Liverpool and picking up wins at Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and Chelsea.Solskjær says Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelöf are indeed injury doubts. The Manchester United manager said the trio are touch-and-go to face Bournemouth. Steve Bruce has been bigging up Newcastle’s chances of rocketing up the Premier League. His side take on West Ham at the London Stadium on Saturday having won one of their past eight matches. As for team news, Andy Carroll could feature against his former club, while Fabian Schär and Matt Ritchie will miss out. Schär, Bruce says, could return against Bournemouth next weekend. Man United are seventh and they’ve won three games. Two or three points separate a vast amount of teams. If you put back-to-back wins together, you shoot up the table, and that has to be our aim. We’re quietly confident we can go to West Ham and get a result. I think we all feel as though we’re not far off. We’ve had a couple of magic moments by beating Spurs and Man United. The consistency looks to have arrived defensively. The front three are still settling in. We’re aware of it, we have to improve, but I think we’ll get there. The players enjoy coming in – there’s a good spirit among the group and around the training ground.”Ole Gunnar Solskjær will be previewing Manchester United’s trip to Bournemouth shortly, with the manager likely to give an update on the fitness of Victor Lindelöf, Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire, who all picked up niggles at Stamford Bridge in midweek. Paul Pogba is sidelined until December but, by next summer, United get their hands on a new prized possession:Whet the appetite for the weekend:After some riveting cup action, back into the thick of it. First thing’s first, and as scarcely believable as it may seem, Manchester United could win a fourth successive game on Saturday, if they pick up three points at not so sunny Bournemouth. Then there’s Granit Xhaka v The Emirates part II, as Arsenal host Wolves and the small fry of Liverpool going to Villa Park.

Le Korsa funded the installation of bore-wells outfitted with solar-powered pumps in each village, which provides year-round access to water and helps growing through the harsh dry season.Also featured as part of this project are architectural and landscape images of street installations of the portraits exhibited in key migration destinations in Africa and Europe, including Dakar, Marrakech, Berlin and Milan.In each location, large-scale photographs were printed and displayed across the city, where people could appreciate the pictures and see themselves reflected in their own society.The photographic project is accompanied by SenegalSicily, which is a series of short documentaries created with the Italian film-maker Alberto Amoretti. Both projects aim to explore different aspects of clandestine migration.The first documentary of the series is a dialogue between a mother, Aisadou, speaking from her village in the east part of Senegal, and her son Alpha in Sicily, who has left home to find a better future. Aisadou lives in Sinthian, a village in Tambacounda. This is where the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation built Thread, a community centre and artists’ residence.Aisadou and her son AlphaAlpha lives in Mazzarino, a small town in the centre of Sicily. Mother and son talk about their hopes and their regrets Aisadou talks of her worries as a mother and Alpha about the hardships he has faced.The documentaries each feature the experiences, dreams and reflections of migrants and their relatives who remained in Senegal. These include the monologues of Aisadou and Alpha, discussions with migrant residents of San Berillo in Catania and interviews with families of migrants who died at sea.“After screening in Sinthian, we met a man who had begun to save money to start the trip. Now we don’t know what happened to him, but what it is important is that after seeing the film, he reconsidered,” Hänninen says.The project wants to show to the young people of Tambacounda who are considering leaving a sincere account of the risks of the voyage and the reality of those who made it to Europe.Young Women of Le FoyerLe Foyer de Jeunes Filles in Tambacounda is a home for girls and young women who come to the city to attend secondary school. Coming from villages that only have primary schools, the girls find a safe place to live while they complete their education. If it was not for Le Foyer, they would have abandoned their studies and, most likely, remained in their villages and married underage. The girls at Le Foyer talk about their desire to get the training they need to help their country. They not only want to graduate, but also to become leaders of a new Senegal.Khadidiatou Nadya and Khady Camara, young women of Le FoyerKhadidiatou had to fight to get the permission from her father to finish her schooling to become a nurse. She helps the family with her small savings from her scholarship and her part-time job as tutor at the Foyer de Jeunes Filles. She is the only one in a family of 16 sons to be allowed to have access to secondary school. One of her brothers decided to leave illegally Senegal and reach Europe. At the time of the interview, he was kept in refugee camp in Sicily, waiting for papers.To help disseminate the message of the films, the Albers Foundation and Le Korsa have launched a series of film screenings and discussions throughout the Tambacounda region, specifically targeting remote and rural areas. The screenings unite families, teachers and local leaders in dialogue about the experiences of migrants, and how the financial resources devoted to migration may be better used to improve life locally.The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and Le Korsa will display a selection of images and films from both projects at Also Known as Africa (AKAA) art and design fair held in Paris, 9-11 November 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67c893941d80d1ccad6f329ac7ca91de791905f8/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27d91cda5caafc4e72d2fa7e606b4375","title":"not enough hours in the day well finding more may not help","story":"Just because your problem is one of strained capacity, don’t assume increasing capacity is the answerThe logic here isn’t hard to see – provide more of something, or charge less for it, and people will use more of it – but it’s easy to overlook how many areas of life it affects. One well-known example is electricity usage, where the Jevons paradox explains how making appliances more energy efficient can backfire by stimulating demand. It’s massively cheaper, and kinder to the environment, to keep a bottle of milk cool in 2019 than it was in 1940, but the result isn’t that we use less electricity on refrigeration: it’s that people buy bigger fridges, or multiple fridges, and that more people lower down the global income ladder have fridges to begin with. This brings many benefits, but lower energy consumption isn’t among them.Less obviously, the same issue afflicts struggles with email overload: get more efficient at processing email, and you’re effectively reducing the cost to others of emailing you, so it’s more likely they will. Work expands to fill the time available – which is why people who transform themselves into 26-lane highways of productivity often find they’re no less busy than before.Even the relationship dynamic known as “overfunctioning and underfunctioning” is a disguised case of induced demand. If you’re the overfunctioner in your house – the one who always cleans the kitchen, otherwise it won’t get done – you’re keeping down the price of not cleaning it, from your partner’s perspective, thus reinforcing their decision not to bother. And should you find a way to do it faster, so it eats less of your time, you’ll be actively reducing the price, making it even more likely you’ll find yourself cleaning the kitchen tomorrow, or next year.What to do? The rule of thumb is: just because your problem is one of strained capacity, don’t assume increasing capacity is the answer. It may make more sense to emulate 14th Street and reduce, or at least put a ceiling on, your capacity instead. Resolve to process email for a certain period each day, rather than trying to answer it all, and you’ll moderate the incoming flow. Stop cleaning the kitchen for a week, and your partner may reach a threshold of disgust and pick up the mop themselves. And so on. Beware the struggle to “get everything done”, which is equivalent to the struggle to make space for every driver who wants to use a given stretch of road often, the result is just to increase the size of the “everything”.In 2016’s Deep Work, Cal Newport explains one way of reducing overwhelm by limiting your capacity – ‘fixed-schedule productivity’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/386d270f5141473da8bc4d9faaaa43dcf6fb4d60/0_38_4543_2726/master/4543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=972a4780ff390d391011d4ce8a60afda","title":"to do lists are a curse of your own making","story":"No one asks me to do half the things on my list. So why do we do it?Recently I found myself idly complaining to my local beautician about my stresses: workload, flat-hunting and my car needing repairs. “Seems like the evil eye is looking at you, hun,” she said, cheerily ripping the hair from my shin.It’s been years since I’ve heard someone mention the evil eye. I grew up with the folklore but have always rejected superstition.“Bit much, no?” I mentioned to Mum, later. “Me, describing a bad yet ordinary week, and her saying, ‘Oh you must be cursed, love.’”That’s because the evil eye is a malevolent glare cast at those with something beautiful, hard-won and excellent their longing manifesting as a destructive curse. (As superstitions go, this must rank as one of the nicest. “Hey, has something gone wrong? That’s because you’re great.”)After the salon came more bad news, more curveballs, and an accelerating to-do list. I was failing in my numerous roles – as love project manager, friend cheerleader, health aficionado. So when I found myself in A\u0026ampE with a torn shoulder tendon and a doctor’s note telling me to stop everything at once, I felt relief. I had an excuse to step back.No one asks me to do half the things on my list. My boyfriend does not ask me to plan every dinner. No one tells me to exercise. Mum couldn’t have asked me to set up a smart heating system for her, when she doesn’t know what it is. So why do we do it?Perhaps we – women, especially – think we should. Or maybe the curse is a manifestation of fear, of knowing what is beautiful, hard-won and excellent in our lives, and that it can be easily lost. Perhaps my beautician was right. An evil eye did look at me, but it was my own eye all along."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f16a1dc86ab6fe28acd8b25f4c0c3dbb1ca0749/0_504_6419_3851/master/6419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e7ea89690e08ff9b7cb39de6ac78cee","title":"world stone skimming championships easdale","story":"I came with lofty ambitions. But I soon find out what I’m up against in this fiercely competitive sportThere aren’t many actual rock stars in the world of competitive stone skimming. But with his wiry frame, camouflage jacket and eyebrows thicker than a Gallagher brother’s, Dougie Isaacs is one. Isaacs can skim a stone 121.8 metres, further than anyone on the planet. Bottle of beer in one hand, cigarette in the other, he brings a frisson of danger to a sport that is beginning to take itself rather seriously. As one French skimmer says of Isaacs, “He doesn’t give a fuck.” To take part in a previous world record attempt, Isaacs missed his grandmother’s funeral. He has won the World Stone Skimming Championships eight times – six more than anyone else. But his last win was in 2016, and there is an influx of new skimmers on the scene who smell blood.Easdale island lies off the west coast of Scotland and has hosted the World Stone Skimming Championships since 1997, raising money for the local community. Each year, people from all over the world arrive on a 10-person ferry from the neighbouring island of Seil, to watch and take part. This year I’m one of them. My interest was piqued by an online clip of an exuberant Japanese skimmer called Keisuke Hashimoto – the winner in 2017. I take a bus from Oban to Seil, where I meet some of the event’s stars in the pub. Guy Tarring, a ruddy man in his 60s, who carries cigars and looks like Iggy Pop if he had gone into marketing instead of rock’n’roll, tells us that he has twice come second in the Old Tossers category (the event has only ever been won by Ron Long, a 75-year-old Welshman with a moustache like a paintbrush). Tarring once paid Isaacs to train him in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, where Isaacs practises on the River Ericht. He remembers one drunken night when Isaacs waded across the river and painted white lines on a wall to indicate how far his skims had travelled. Tarring says the key to a good skim is “power” and “thrust”, but then he points to his head. Ultimately, he says, “it’s about up here”.Later that day, I head to Easdale. It’s a haven of striking beauty, dotted with quarriers’ cottages. It was a bastion of the British slate industry until 1850, when a vast storm struck, flooding the quarries and devastating the island. The population dropped to four. Now, around 60 people live here. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else’s business in 2014 a baby was born on the island for the first time in 80 years.When the world championships descend, the population swells to around 1,000. “Most people come to an island like this for peace and quiet,” says Ruth Barratt, who is trying to sell the B\u0026ampB she runs. “Although we appreciate the income, it’s not something we enjoy.”Her partner, Dughall Macleod, tells me about one of the young pretenders to the stone throne – Alex Lewis, 22, who beat Isaacs in July to become the current English champion. He has also held the British championship title since 2017, and has won the Swiss and Welsh championships once each. The world championship, however, has remained elusive. “When he lost last year… oh Jesus,” Macleod says. “There was no consoling the guy.”As the sun sets, I walk down to the water for some practice. It’s frustrating to be bad at something that seems so simple. Yet each time I think I’m finished, another stone calls to me, demanding to be skimmed. I head to the pub again, where I meet Lewis. He has a tiny moustache and looks a little suspicious as I sidle up. One of the reasons he has never won here, he says, is because the rules don’t work in his favour. He can’t understand why the organisers stipulate that all stones be no more than three inches in diameter. “The organisers aren’t bothered about changing the rules because they make tons of money out of this regardless,” he says.The championships have become too successful, Lewis thinks, and should move. The island is so small that only a few hundred people can watch at a time. And when skimmers skim, they must keep the stone within a designated lane and only throw a maximum of 63 metres – the distance to the back wall at the end of the flooded quarry. At the British championship, Lewis skimmed 111 metres. “In order for stone skimming to get to the next level,” he says, “there needs to be a competition that is open-water, that can take huge numbers of attendants, that is bigger than this competition.”Lewis has investigated the science of the skim. He has done “variable tests” – throwing 50 stones of different weight and thickness drawing charts to compare movement. He throws at about five degrees to the horizontal. The first bounce should be around 10 metres from you, he says – or 18-20 metres in windier conditions. “You get a relatively flat stone that’s got a hook in it, that you can get your finger into, then when you release, you get spin,” he adds. “If you can get it so the stone lands flat on the water, you’ll do OK.”Of all the people I meet, Lewis is most alert to the money-making potential of skimming, a sport that offers no cash prizes. He recently wore a T-shirt to a skimming event that, by chance, had a photo of a chalet on it. The chalet owner got in touch to tell Lewis that if he continued to wear it, he could stay in the chalet for nothing. Lewis hates social media, but wants to be filmed by a drone and has his sights set on a photogenic place in Germany called Devil’s Bridge. As I leave, he hands me a business card. It says “Alex Lewis: international stone skimmer”.The morning of the championships arrives and I practise with some kids at the quarry. Worryingly, there is an eight-year-old here who looks more promising than me. A man turns up and launches some stones. This turns out to be Peter Szep, the defending champion. He says there’s nothing to do but try your best. “Most of the time it’s luck,” he says.I find “Old Tosser” Ron Long, who seems to be something of a media star. Long was a fireman who got caught by a collapsing roof in a hotel fire in 1992. “All of my upper-body muscles atrophied and so it was necessary to rebuild them,” he says. “Stone skimming came into it at that stage, as an upper-body activity that didn’t require too much head movement.”Long wants “full and complete recognition of stone skimming as a genuine, bona fide sport”. He believes the stones should be standardised, comparing the idea of picking your own stones to someone turning up to an Olympic javelin event with their own spear. He knows a manufacturer of decorative stone products who could do the job. “This was always a family day out before the professionals turned up,” says Dughall Macleod from the B\u0026ampB. “They take it too seriously. It’s like a bunch of Hells Angels turning up to a kindergarten.”In 2013, Lucy Wood, five-time women’s world champion, asked Max Farrand, a sports technology research technician at Loughborough University, to help her. He built a pond in the lab and they used motion-tracking technology to capture a 3D image of Wood in action. They also used force plates to examine her weight distribution and high-speed video to record her skims. “You don’t throw from your arm, you throw from your body,” Wood says, comparing skimming to a car braking with objects on the back seat. “The stone is part of your body.”The tournament begins at the quarry. A hush descends as Isaacs, a favourite here, steps up. When he hits the back wall with his first and third skim there is an almighty cheer from the 350-strong crowd. To qualify for the final, you need to strike the wall with one of your first three throws. Isaacs, Szep, Lewis, Long and seven other men do it, the highest number ever. Long’s skim is controversial though, according to Lewis, who claims it didn’t touch the wall. I came to the championships with lofty ambitions, but my first skim goes outside the designated boundary. When my next travels 43 metres, I think there’s a chance. Then my final skim goes out of bounds, too. I realise that to be a champion, you must skim as if no one is watching. I skim as though everyone is watching, and am punished accordingly.The final score is cumulative, the best possible being 189 metres (three back walls). Skim outside the boundaries even once at this level, and you have almost certainly bungled it. This is what Lewis does on his first throw, so his two subsequent back walls are academic. Isaacs, wearing a khaki jacket and a white T-shirt with the word “Bawbags” on it, hits the wall with his first throw, then skims 61 and 54 metres. Ultimately, however, Szep defends his title, clinching it with three back walls. Isaacs, joint second, will fight another day. The women’s champion is Christina Bowen Bravery, who won the English championships this year. Long, as ever, is crowned Old Tosser.“That was the toughest final,” Lewis says. With three back walls, Szep was indisputably the winner, but Lewis can’t help pointing out that he is the first person in the history of the tournament to hit five back walls. Yet still the world championship evades him.Given the differences between the Easdale event and the way other championships are run, one can understand Lewis’s frustration. But the popularity of the competition is surely linked inextricably to the island and its geography. Were they to move, they might no longer be the eccentric spectacle they are now. “It’s slightly spiritual up here,” says Tarring, looking around the island. “Great things are hard to find. This is a great thing.” 1 Find a flat stone of about 3½in. It’s best if it has a wee notch in it so you can dig your fingers in and get a spin on the stone when you release it. 2 Aim to throw it at 20 degrees to the horizontal. When you throw, try to land your stone flat on the water.3 You want the first bounce to be around 10 metres in front of you. Anything less, it won’t last the distance.4 Technique beats power every time. To get a great performance, it helps to be relaxed.5 Practise. There’s no life hack to making it as a champion stone skimmer. I skim about 100 stones a week, over two sessions. Any more and I would risk injury.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5c9833432c54381ec7a1964f9b8a1bced33833/0_340_6612_3968/master/6612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ccbd0c8fd7b51725533a17220dae1f4","title":"michael kiwanuka kiwanuka review one of the greatest albums of the decade","story":"(Polydor)The soulful singer’s third LP is timeless and contemporary at the same time, with shades of everything from What’s Going On to ScreamadelicaMichael Kiwanuka’s first two albums established him as a folksy symphonic soul man akin to Bill Withers and Terry Callier, and set the bar pretty high. This one knocks it skyward. Together with producer-to-the-stars Danger Mouse and London hip-hop producer Inflo, the British-Ugandan 32-year-old has broadened his territory to stretch from Donny Hathaway-style melancholy soul through to Rolling Stones-y gospel rock, psychedelic soul and breakbeat. There are strings and harps, samples of civil rights campaigners, Hendrix-type frazzled guitars and Burt Bacharach-type orchestrations. The dreamlike, revelatory quality is reminiscent of Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On and Primal Scream’s Screamadelica.Unusually, in these streaming-led times, Kiwanuka is a contemplative song cycle intended to be listened to in one extended sitting, which he says is “a reaction against this fast-paced, throwaway, machine-led world”. It sounds timeless and contemporary the instrumental interludes and the stylistic and tempo shifts all hang together because of his warm, sincere vocals and fantastic songwriting. At the core is Kiwanuka’s inner battle between anxiety, self-doubt, spirituality and wisdom, which is then set against racism and rueful glances at the state of the world. Thus, killer opener You Ain’t the Problem is both an encouraging nudge to himself and a sharp put-down of attitudes towards immigration: “If you don’t belong, you’re not the problem.”Hero compares the murder of 60s activist Fred Hampton with recent US police shootings (“on the news again, I guess they killed another”), also referenced in the insistent Rolling (“No tears for the young, a bullet if you’re wrong”). Piano Joint (This Kind of Love) and Hard to Say Goodbye are beautifully pensive and Final Days ponders nuclear apocalypse. But for all its melancholy, Kiwanuka is never downbeat. There are moments – such as the “Time is the healer” gospel choir in I’ve Been Dazed, or hopeful closer Light – when positivity bursts through with such dazzling effect you want to cheer. Kiwanuka is a bold, expansive, heartfelt, sublime album. He’s snuck in at the final whistle, but surely this is among the decade’s best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d876bcd4e7e916ea05d4442e50f8437b282ad3d/411_679_4755_2853/master/4755.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc5ed254254881300fbc5cea33762708","title":"nicholas kenyon early music revival period instruments classical music baroque authentic","story":"Fifty years ago the quest for authentic performances of early music turned the classical world on its head and changed the way we listen for good. Was it all positives? Gramophone magazine generally selects the megastars of the classical music world as recipients of its annual Lifetime Achievement award. Conductors Claudio Abbado and Bernard Haitink, players Isaac Stern and James Galway, singers Kiri te Kanawa and Montserrat Caballé have all been honoured. But this year the award went to a specialist in early music who has quietly been the voice of a revolution: the soprano Emma Kirkby. Her pure, direct, intensely eloquent singing on recordings over recent decades can truly be said to have changed the sound of music in our time. She has been the voice of the abbess Hildegard of Bingen on the bestselling Gothic Voices, she has cut through the refiner’s fire in Christopher Hogwood’s famous recording of Handel’s Messiah, and on countless recital discs she has explored the intimate expressiveness of the lute song.Gramophone’s honouring of Kirkby reveals the extent to which early music, once a connoisseur’s backwater, has become mainstream. It’s half a century since medieval and Renaissance music burst from its cocoon and, through the energy of David Munrow and other pioneers, became a sophisticated, professionalised idiom. Ensembles revived the music of the Renaissance with the folk-inspired voices of Jantina Noorman and Montserrat Figueras. Soon the music of the baroque followed. In Britain, Trevor Pinnock, Christopher Hogwood, Roger Norrington and Andrew Parrott worked with the advancing skills of period-style instrumentalists and singers to reanimate a repertory of forgotten and familiar music with their ensembles in the 1970s and 80s. In Austria, the pioneering Nikolaus Harnoncourt brought back to life the wonderfully elaborate early baroque music of Biber and Schmelzer alongside recording all Bach’s cantatas with the Dutch musician Gustav Leonhardt. It was a thrilling period of exploration and discovery.In place of the sustained, rich, legato sounds of modern chamber orchestras performing Bach and Vivaldi, period instrument bands brought transparency, short-breathed phrasing and sharp articulation. Not everyone liked this change: tussling with the challenges of “original instruments” was a controversial activity, and to many established musicians, deeply unwelcome. “We need a revival of period instruments as much as we need a revival of period dentistry,” quipped a Gramophone reviewer. For conductors such as Raymond Leppard and Neville Marriner, who had revived baroque music with modern instruments, it was particularly galling that their insights were now overlooked and replaced by the pungent (and as they saw it in the early days, ill-tuned) sounds of period instruments, with gut strings and more primitive wind and brass instruments without later technical improvements. Wouldn’t Mozart have loved a modern Steinway? Wouldn’t Machaut have relished the sound of a synthesiser? Well, maybe, but they would then have written very different music.Period-instrument recording boomed as the players became more skilful. When Hogwood began to record the early Mozart symphonies, the LPs were astonishingly popular, riding high in the charts with Pavarotti. They were praised by critics for being neutral in tone and “uninterpreted”, as if that were a virtue.A backlash was inevitable. The violinist Nigel Kennedy, denouncing period performances of Bach wrote: “Even the description of oneself as being ‘authentic’ is unbelievably arrogant – and, in the case of so-called ‘period’ performance, misguided. How can music … be authentic if it is stripped of passion and made into an exercise of painfully self-conscious technique?”Another attack came from within the movement. The US conductor and scholar Richard Taruskin argued fiercely that what was seen as the recreation of an authentic past was in fact the creation of a newly modern and vital performing style. His intervention did not deter either performers or record companies, now boosted by the arrival of the CD, from re-recording masterpieces in period-style performances: Beethoven symphonies led by Roger Norrington, Schumann from John Eliot Gardiner, Wagner from Simon Rattle, right up to Debussy and Ravel played by François-Xavier Roth’s  Les Siècles, recreating the sounds of these works when first heard. The pungent sounds of that ensemble, with its reedy bassoons and strident flutes, were a mile away from the warmly homogeneous and integrated textures of the modern international orchestras.From a period of polarisation, early music and period-instrument performance has today surely reached a new maturity, in which it can feel satisfaction at the impact it has made on the mainstream. Conventional orchestras from Berlin to Boston are anxious to glean the latest expert insights. Even now, when CDs have ceded to streaming, ensembles are still researching and recording fascinating forgotten corners of the repertory. Alongside that, we can equally relish the creative imagination of another Gramophone award winner, the pianist Víkingur Ólafsson, whose piercingly intelligent reinventions of Bach give us hope that whatever the sound of early and period-instrument music in the future, it will continue to be a central part of our lives.• Nicholas Kenyon’s six-part series The Future of the Past – Early Music Today begins on BBC Radio 3 on 3 November at 11pm and available on BBC Sounds.

The most noticeable being the breathless, almost sexual excitement in his voice. As if the whole thing had been a snuff movie played out as a video game. But what also struck me was the US president’s description of the Islamic State leader having “died like a dog”. Because I can only assume he has no idea of the value people attach to their dogs. We got Herbert Hound eight years ago when our daughter left home to go to university – I don’t need a shrink to make the connection – and from the day he arrived I fell hopelessly in love with him. Now he’s a relatively old man, I am heartbroken at the thought he might die within the next five years. When he gets ill, he will be accorded all the medical care I would begrudge myself, and his death will be marked by a full state funeral. For essential reading on both the meaning of dogs and the meaning of life, I can recommend Anthony McGowan’s wonderful book How to Teach Philosophy to Your Dog, a series of conversations he had with his dog, Monty, while out walking together. The final chapter is a touching meditation on death and the existence – or not – of God, that takes in everything from Aristotle to Schopenhauer and leaves you suspecting dogs might already have had many of the answers all along. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio  Than are dreamed of in your philosophy.After weeks of on-off, on-off speculation about when the general election might take place, parliament finally voted to have one in December. The tipping point had come when the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party indicated they would be willing to vote in favour if they were allowed one last chance to vote against an election on Monday when the government had brought forward a bill under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for a third time. After that, Labour was rather obliged to come onboard or else it would have appeared frightened of the electorate. Even then, there was some last-minute wrangling. The Tories wanted 12 December on the grounds that was the date they first thought of. Everyone else wanted 9 December because it was a date the government had not proposed. But 12 December got it, which is the worst possible day for me as it is the tail end of the week my daughter and her husband are coming over from the US for a pre-Christmas visit. So now I’ll hardly see them. Thanks everyone. With all the predictions for the 2017 election having been hopelessly inaccurate, everyone is being much more guarded this time round despite the Conservatives being well ahead in the polls. No one knows if Labour votes in the north will hold up, whether the Lib Dems will eat into the Tories or if the Brexit party will have any impact. It would be top banter if the election returned another hung parliament that was unable to resolve Brexit.The final prime minister’s questions of the parliament once again proved something that many of us had already suspected. That Boris Johnson isn’t actually very good at being a leader. He blusters, has no grasp of detail and lacks a fundamental seriousness when required. He is at best an after-dinner corporate speaker for businesses on a tight budget. Johnson may yet not prove to be the asset on the campaign trail the Tories hope. He did OK during the EU referendum because then he was only ever expected to make promises. The more lavish, the better. Now, as prime minister, he is expected to deliver on the promises he makes. And his track record on that is piss-poor, as so often he can only resort to lying. At this PMQs, he once again insisted it was the House of Commons that had blocked his Brexit bill. It hadn’t. It had passed it, but then he had sulked and pulled it. MPs have received a lot of criticism for being a “zombie parliament” but actually most have done their jobs with great integrity. The split in the Commons reflected the split in the country and many MPs have withstood acute pressure from their parties to hold the government to account. It is telling that most of the MPs who are standing down at this election – many of them women – are precisely the ones who have done their best not to let the government railroad them into poor decisions. They will be greatly missed. If you think this parliament has been toxic, the next one could be even more so as the new intake will more closely resemble the extremes of their parties.I can’t say I would be best pleased if I had been one of the guests who had booked flights and bribed their son to take care of the dog while they were away, but such considerations don’t appear to have entered Simon Cowell’s head when he chose to cancel his 60th birthday party at the last minute. Instead, he just sent out a quick note saying the whole thing was off and he might reschedule something for December and that if he did then they were welcome to drop in. Then again, December might be tricky, so it could be in the new year. Or never. Now it’s possible Simon is so riddled with insecurities that he cancelled because he couldn’t bear the thought half the people might find something better to do with their lives on the night – get their hair dyed, for instance – and he’d have loads of empty places round the table. If so, I know how he feels. Whenever I entertain at home – something I do increasingly rarely – I’m always tempted to get my cancellations in first. More likely, he’s so self-obsessed he’s unaware that other people really exist. So far, the only reason given for the cancellation is that he wants to concentrate on his work as the X Factor ratings nosee. As if he couldn’t spare four hours. My guess is that the real reason is he’s actually going through an existential narcissistic breakdown. He literally can’t bear the fact he’s 60. Something I experienced three years ago. Which is why I never even bothered to plan a party.I can only hope that if ever I found myself under investigation, the inquiry would be conducted by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Right now, it appears to be even dopier than the Department for Transport was when Chris Grayling was in charge. Blaggers from around the world will be queuing up to fleece the DCMS for every grant going, even if they aren’t close friends of the prime minister. I’m quite tempted to put in an application myself, just so I can acquire the Lucie Rie and Jennifer Lee ceramics I covet. It seems all you have to do to get £100,000 off the department is to write down any old tosh and say you could do with some money. You just write “give us the cash” and a week later they give you the cash. It really is as easy as that. The minister in charge of the forensic investigation into how Jennifer “You’re the Mount Everest every man wants to climb” Arcuri secured the money for her no-hoper company was Nicky Morgan, who has just announced she is standing down at the next election. After what she’s just done for Boris, it can’t be long before she finds herself in the House of Lords."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5ca0de3e23b1bcb0b9f512147ba9870396583c/1_274_730_438/master/730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=698c7c2a5b5f421ca6855407a80a776f","title":"tories accused of using public funds for ads on facebook in key seats","story":"Ads claim £3.6bn to be spent on boosting high streets across north of England and MidlandsBoris Johnson’s government has been accused of going on a spending spree using taxpayers’ money to woo voters in swing seats in the run up to the general election.Ministers released details on Wednesday of plans to improve dilapidated town centres of key marginal seats mainly across the north of England and the Midlands. Public money is being spent to publicise the scheme using targeted Facebook advertisements sent to local people.In an announcement on a government website, the department of housing, communities and local government claimed that part of a £3.6bn fund would be spent boosting rundown high streets across dozens of towns.Adverts inform the public that “the government is investing up to £25m” in their local area, featuring the name and image of the local town. In reality, the sum going to each settlement is likely to be much smaller.The seats being targeted include Wakefield, Bolton, Northampton, Milton Keynes, Mansfield, Lincoln, and Newcastle-under-Lyme as well as some coastal towns such as Lowestoft.It also appears that public funding may have been used to buy adverts promoting government investment in Workington – the home of “Workington Man”, which some Tory-backing groups have suggested is the stereotypical inidual who needs to be won over to win the election.According to the Huffington Post, ministers authorised the adverts to go live on Tuesday – the same day Johnson received parliamentary support for a snap general election.The decision to use public funds to promote the adverts shows how the government is able to skirt rules that restrict public advertising spending during elections, as parliament has yet to be dissolved and the campaign has not formally begun.The adverts are also not recorded by Facebook as being of a political nature, making it harder to see how much money the government is spending on the campaign and raising questions about the effectiveness of the social network’s political transparency measures.The Labour MP Ian Lucas has called the promotion an “outrageous” misuse of public money. “These adverts are being deployed to Tory target seats on the cusp of a general election,” he said. “It would be an insult to our intelligence to say that this isn’t public money being used for political purposes. It clearly is.“It is an example of how the government is merging political activity with the arms of government in its own political interest,” he told the news website.Lucas has written to Michael Gove, the cabinet minister, demanding to know how data was gathered for the campaign and how much it has cost.Parliament has not yet dissolved and the civil service has not officially entered the pre-election period when it must remain neutral. The advertisements were published after Labour had acknowledged it would back an election.In the wake of the\u0026nbspCambridge Analytica scandal, there is a heightened sensitivity around the use of personal data in political campaigning.Facebook allows political parties to target you for adverts in\u0026nbspthree different ways. They can choose to show ads to people based on age, location, and interests. So, for example, you could choose to advertise to men aged 35-44 in Yorkshire. Or women aged 65+ that Facebook considers to be interested in a specific topic.Additionally, Facebook allows political parties to combine Facebook’s audience with existing data they have, such as phone numbers or email addresses, or people who have been tracked visiting a party’s website.Facebook also has a feature called “Lookalike Audiences”. It allows parties to try to target people who behave similarly on Facebook to those for whom they have contact details.As a result of controversy around political adverts on Facebook, the social media company introduced an\u0026nbspAd Library\u0026nbspwhere you can, in theory, see all the adverts being paid for by political parties, and a rough estimate of how much money has been spent, and the audiences they have been targeting.Under the MyTown scheme, each local authority will receive a share of capacity funding to kickstart plans to redevelop town centres. Ministers said the funding could be used to redevelop vacant buildings and land, drive private-sector investment by supporting small businesses and ensure that young people have the skills they need to get good jobs.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has come under pressure to follow Twitter in banning political ads, but has refused.A government spokesman told the news website that ministers would respond to Lucas’s letter. “These posts were published before the election was called and parliament has not yet been dissolved. All towns selected were chosen according to the same selection methodology, including analysis of deprivation, exposure to Brexit, productivity, economy resilience and investment opportunities,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ac238ffacfe4f248bdc54b5c2c466277f1187a2/0_48_8333_5002/master/8333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b12061328ed9bc1c22ee17e77ade5b8","title":"england south africa storm rugby world cup final","story":"Around 37 million inhabitants live in Japan’s sprawling capital city, enough to make the chances of bumping into Eddie Jones in a random shop in a non-touristy part of town the day before a World Cup final almost comically remote. Of all the people in all the world you would not expect to see browsing clothing racks and looking for presents on a Friday afternoon it would be England’s head coach on the eve of the biggest game of his life.The middle-aged couple who persuaded him to pose for a selfie just around from the leisurewear section could scarcely believe their luck. Jones does not come across as a habitual high street browser – nor, after eight weeks of press conferences, could you blame him for not looking delighted to see the man from the  – but the caption wrote itself. England are so well prepared for the final their coach has already begun his Christmas shopping.The players seem particularly relaxed and calm, too. Barely had Jones left the shop than the internet was creaking afresh under the weight of training ground pictures of Jonny Wilkinson coaching the squad’s current captain, Owen Farrell, in the art of drop-goals. Again it was a snapshot that neatly reflected England’s state of mind. Sixteen years on from their last great golden era, sealed by Wilkinson’s immortal extra-time drop, they feel they have every base covered.This is not to say rugby’s great prize is automatically coming home to Twickenham for the first time since 2003. What is indisputable is that England have spent four years painstakingly working towards this moment. Last week against New Zealand they delivered their best performance in many years. If it all goes pear-shaped from here they can hardly blame their preparation, their management, their available budget or the weather, which has turned beautifully clear and sunny in the past couple of days.All of which explains why England, as a nation, has not looked forward this expectantly to a game of rugby in ages. In clubhouses, pubs and sitting rooms across the land, they will be lying back and thinking of an England in which everything, in these days of political ision and intolerance, is gloriously rosy. The cricket World Cup has already been reeled in and here is a another high-profile global opportunity. If Jones’s boys come good even Ben Stokes’s compelling case to be Sports Personality of the Year may have to be reassessed.It would, of course, be pushing it to suggest the 2019 squad are anything like as well-known or feted as their 2003 predecessors were at this same juncture. The faces of Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Jason Robinson and Wilkinson had already been carved on Twickenham’s equivalent of Mount Rushmore before that Sydney final. Even now, if Jamie George and Elliot Daly popped out for a quick lunchtime coffee in Slough the staff member serving them would still be asking what names he or she should write on their takeaway cups.This says less about George or Daly, both starting Lions and excellent role models, as crowd-pleasing athletes and rather more about the public’s complex relationship with rugby union. There will always be those who want to read George Eliot instead and would never contemplate venturing to the Stoop or Sandy Park on an average Premiership weekend. Others still regard it as a pumped-up minority sport and will forever stick to watching Chelsea or Wolverhampton Wanderers. Rare are the days outside World Cups and Six Nations when the oval ball reaches a peak terrestrial audience or penetrates the consciousness of those who can just about recognise Wilkinson and, at a stretch, Will Carling.Nor has the Rugby Football Union always been brilliant at preaching to the unconverted, particularly since the national side crashed and burned in the pool stages of the home 2015 World Cup. What should have been the springboard to a whole new level of popularity was ultimately the biggest missed opportunity in the history of English team sport. Which is why the RFU owes a significant debt of gratitude to this current group of players, now on the verge of digging their currently cash-strapped union out of a sizeable hole by selling the game afresh to the next generation.Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill … the fact the 21-year-old Curry is the only Englishman on the shortlist for World Rugby Player of the Year should not obscure the fact his country have an array of twinkling new stars emerging. When they last made the final in 2007, having already lost 36-0 to their opponents South Africa in their pool, no one expected much and the highest-profile fan to send a message in final week was the singer Kenny Rogers, whose song “The Gambler” had become an unlikely dressing-room favourite. This time even Prince Harry has been sending pictures of his son in an England babygro and there is far more belief, both inside and outside the camp.Much of it is based on the compelling evidence of the past couple of months. On their travels between Miyazaki, Sapporo, Kobe, Tokyo, Oita and Yokohama, Jones’s side have yet to be seriously challenged on the scoreboard. They have not just beaten all the southern hemisphere opposition put in front of them but have stuck 39 and 40 points respectively on Argentina and Australia and left the whole of New Zealand practically speechless.They have, moreover, defended with such physicality that opponents have often been unable to establish a consistent foothold in games. By the time the so-called “finishers” have appeared, the tone has already been set. Nothing – from typhoons and humidity to Brodie Retallick and Ardie Savea – has inconvenienced them for too long. Those drawing similarities between England and Saracens – serial winners in Europe and domestically in recent seasons – have been doing so with good reason.There is just one fly in the miso soup – and a substantial one at that. Virtually every World Cup final in the modern era, save for New Zealand’s spectacular dismissal of Australia four years ago – has been tight and tense. South Africa’s pack are every bit as physical as their opposite numbers and have a set piece that has so far ground down all comers. To date the Boks have lost only one lineout in the whole tournament and have a pair of half-backs in Faf de Klerk and Handre Pollard capable of kicking any side where it hurts. Some of Pollard’s goal-kicking against Wales in the semi-final was as sweet as anything in this tournament, while the brilliant Cheslin Kolbe can make mugs of even the best defenders.While England stand within sight of becoming the first team to beat the Wallabies, the All Blacks and the Springboks at a single World Cup, it is also the case that no side have gone on to lift the trophy after beating New Zealand en route for 28 years. Listening to Pollard and his captain, Siya Kolisi, explaining how much it would mean to South Africa to replicate their triumphs of 1995 and 2007 from what was virtually a standing start two years ago was to suspect Farrell and co will have to withstand a serious barrage at some stage.These two sides just happen to be strong in several of the same areas and the Springbok bench, wryly nicknamed the “Bomb Squad”, is also as explosive as any. Kolisi, furthermore, will be winning his 50th cap, while his father has travelled out of Africa for the first time in his life to watch him play.On the face of it the game is unlikely to match the Kiwi pyrotechnics at Twickenham four years ago, with Pollard among those ruling out many “disco lights” when it comes to the Bok gameplan. The battle for gainline supremacy, however, will be a match for any dohyo, the ring in which Japan’s sumo wrestlers grapple. Slow down England’s ball consistently at the breakdown and the hungry Springboks will be in the hunt, particularly if they are a score ahead with half an hour left.If their opponents, on the other hand, display the same dynamism, precision and class which scuppered New Zealand, Wilkinson’s 11th-hour drop-goal tuition should not be required. Having originally tipped South Africa to win this tournament, it now feels as if an improving England should have just enough to reach the promised land. Do so and Jones will have supplied his adopted nation with the ultimate gift.

Yet for Jake Connor, who will make his first Lions appearance, there will be wider reasons to ensure everything goes to plan after a season he will be keen to forget thus far.“It was a nerve-wracking wait for the call-up given everything that’s happened this year,” admits the 25-year-old Connor, who will start in the centres this weekend in place of the injured Oliver Gildart. In Super League, his Hull side looked well-placed for a run at the play-offs midway through this year, before a remarkable end-of-season collapse saw them miss out. The nadir was an embarrassing defeat by Castleford, in which Connor exchanged words with some of his own teammates after being sin-binned for dissent.It left his own coach at Hull, Lee Radford, admitting he needs to calm his on-field temperament, and the player himself fearing he would miss out on a dream trip with Great Britain. “Personally I didn’t have a great season and given how things finished with Hull, I genuinely didn’t know what to expect,” he admits. “It was a nervous wait, but to get the call and try and finish this year on a high is something I’m relishing. It’s an honour to be involved and, after missing out last week, I’m keen to grab this chance with both hands.”While Connor has established a reputation in Super League for a player who can get under his opponents’ skin, it should not overshadow his mercurial talent. Capable of playing in several positions across the backline has been identified as a major strength in Connor’s game since he was a teenager at Huddersfield: but the player himself admits the utility role is something he is growing tired of.“It’s getting to the time where I need to work on one position,” he says. He will play centre this week, but the Great Britain coach, Wayne Bennett, believes he has the tools to play half-back at international level, making this a pivotal period in Connor’s fledgling career. “We’ll have to have a chat when I go back to Hull and see what the plan is there. I’m 25 now, and I need to playing regularly in one role for the good of my own game.”Yet despite such a mixed year – and constant speculation linking him with a move away from Hull – Connor will get the chance to end his season on a high: starting this weekend in the first of two Tests against the Kiwis, before a trip to Papua New Guinea. “The experience has been great and exactly what I needed,” he admits.“I know there’s a lot of history surrounding Great Britain. To play for England last year was great but this will be doubly special because you don’t know when Great Britain will come around again as a concept. I really want to make the most of it all, and try and help the guys win all three of the games we’ve got left.”The Lions were underwhelming, albeit against an impressive Tongan side, last weekend. With the squad’s senior players vocal about their target to win every game on tour, many are expecting a strong response from Bennett’s side on Saturday against a New Zealand side themselves well beaten by Australia last weekend.“It wasn’t great, that defeat, and the mood was a bit sour after but we’ve got over it very quickly,” Connor says. “You don’t come on tours like this expecting to walk into the side, but now the chance is here, it’s up to me. They’re a very strong side, the Kiwis, but we think we’ve got a pretty strong group ourselves here. Just to be still playing after how the season ended in Super League is great for me, though.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb94ceb4ed7d46326d558c30713a5dd540943dc3/749_136_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=535efb7a61d45fb0a6275877faa9d4f6","title":"new zealand wales rugby world cup bronze final report all blacks hansen gatland","story":"Steve Hansen and Warren Gatland, the two longest-serving tier-one coaches in the tournament received standing ovations from the crowd, having taken charge of their sides for the final time, but after the double espressos that were the semi-finals, the bronze-medal match was more of a latte – frothy and nowhere near as hot.It was a night of farewells. As well as Hansen and Gatland taking their final bows, the New Zealand captain Kieran Read was making his last international appearance along with the wing Ben Smith, who was denied a hat-trick of tries by a harsh forward pass call, and Sonny Bill Williams who was never going to take≈his leave without an array of audacious off-loads.Wales, playing New Zealand five days after losing to South Africa, were outclassed but a quality they have honed in the Gatland era is defiance. They were 14 points down after 12 minutes and trailed 35-10 when Williams created a try for his midfield partner Ryan Crotty two minutes after the restart, but they kept coming and it was not until three minutes from the end that the All Blacks scored their sixth and final try.The bronze medal won is unlikely to be displayed prominently at the union’s headquarters in Wellington, probably destined for a bottom drawer, but the bitter taste left by the defeat to England was at least rinsed away.Brodie Retallick showed that the All Blacks were in the mood with a shuddering clear-out at the first ruck, but it was six days too late. The second row was named man of the match after playing it hard and fast, but for all the inidual and collective moments of brilliance here, the evening was an adjournment in the inquest into what happened in the semi-final.New Zealand’s first two tries were typical of their ability to find space in the tightest of areas. Read and Retallick combined to free the prop Joe Moody for the first and then Aaron Smith fixed the defence for Beauden Barrett to cut back, wrong-foot the prop Dillon Lewis and skate away from two defenders.It was looking grim for Wales, but a characteristic they have developed under Gatland is to remain upright no matter the blows they receive. Within 14 minutes they had cut the deficit to four points, Rhys Patchell’s long pass giving Hallam Amos the room to cut inside Ben Smith and score before Patchell kicked a 20-metre penalty.And then Williams and Ben Smith stepped in, the former driving through Patchell to force a turnover. There is no side more ruthless when confronted by a disorganised defence than the All Blacks. Ben Smith moved against the flow of tacklers across the field to step away from them for his first try and his second, with the last move of the opening half, was created by Aaron Smith’s crisp, flat pass.When Williams’s off-load two minutes after the restart set up Crotty, it again looked all black for Wales but after Smith was denied his hat-trick because Reiko Ioane’s attempt to pluck Williams’s one-handed lob out of the air was ruled to have gone forward on its way to the wing, they rallied again.Their replacements made a difference, especially Aaron Shingler and Rhys Carré, and they were rewarded with Josh Adams’s seventh try of the tournament, breaking Wales’s record of six set by Shane Williams. With Justin Tipuric playing more like a three-quarter than a flanker, they threatened to score more, but they were not as assured in open spaces as their opponents.New Zealand had the final word four minutes from time when Richie Mo’unga weaved a spell on tired minds and legs. Then it was time for the goodbyes. Hansen and Gatland were cheered after they had given their immediate post-match interviews on the field, and the players walked slowly around it as if unwilling to concede their World Cup had ended a day early.The fervour for the All Blacks here remains undimmed. Their kit supplier has twice run out of replica jerseys such has been the demand.Hansen spoke afterwards about how he hoped that in the future rugby would be governed with the global game in mind rather than the Six Nations. Japan may hold the key to that and, after a World Cup unlike any other before it, things may never be the same again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dd25aa7c53e73c4adb6e2a5a5fd5e1064ee22f/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39cd5db6011cc99e3f3015b3684a9977","title":"rugby world cup final watching win england south africa","story":"England and South Africa face off in Yokohama on Saturday.

Halep could have crumbled, but it was impressive to see her rise to meet the high bar set by Pliskova. Throughout the second set, she soaked up so many of Pliskova’s body blows and pushed back whenever possible. There are few players as good at flipping a point with a spectacular down-the-line shot while on the run.Pliskova is one of the least expressive players on the court and she is not known for her competitive fire, but there are plenty of examples of her summoning it. From *0-2 down in the third set, she provided another example by keeping her composure to see out the victory as Halep battled both the opponent and herself.Of course, this match will be remembered for Halep’s coach, Darren Cahill, walking onto the court after Pliskova won her third consecutive game for 3-2 and branding her attitude a “disgrace”. It was a strange decision after a hard-fought game and it didn’t seem to help much. As a viewer, it was an ugly sight. But when Pliskova checks out the highlights of this brilliant victory, she’ll be satisfied by how much she made her rival despair.The semi-finals in Shenzhen are now set:The final game was quite something. Halep led 30-0 and seemed to be strolling towards levelling the match, but then Pliskova came alive. The Czech has been mute throughout the match, as she almost always is, yet after she snapped an incredible crosscourt angled backhand for 30-30, she growled loudly in celebration. A shanked backhand error from Halep brought up match point, which Pliskova converted with the greatest slice of luck: her forehand drive volley clipped the net and then dribbled over. That was one of the best, most dramatic matches of the week. Brilliant. What a match. Pliskova advances to the semi-final and will face Ashleigh Barty.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 5-4* Simona Halep: This was already a gripping match, but these last few games have been extraordinary. After being admonished by her coach Cahill, Halep eventually picked herself and stepped into the court. Halep played a great, aggressive return game to break. However, there was absolutely no reaction from her and she spent the break staring blankly ahead.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *5-3 Simona Halep: Halep picks herself up and holds to love with little fanfare. Pliskova will serve for a place in the final.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 5-2* Simona Halep: Too easy. Pliskova holds for 15 with more great serving, punctuated with an unreturned slider out wide.Halep is completely off the boil. It certainly is unacceptable in a match like this but Cahill’s pep talk only seems to have made things worse. Bizarre scenes in Shenzhen.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *4-2 Simona Halep: Halep just played one of her worst games of the entire match to lose her serve to love. She sprayed errors from all parts of the court and finished with a forehand error well long.Meanwhile, Darren Cahill just came on the court and called Halep’s behaviour over the past few games a “disgrace”. The commentators are in shock.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 3-2* Simona Halep: Pliskova continues to live dangerously on her serve, brilliantly digging out a tight deuce game from 0-30 down. She sealed the game with a screaming forehand down the line winner, but even more impressive was the prior point. Halep had her on the ropes, moving her side to side, yet Pliskova defended well and was able to flip the point on its head. Pliskova is not immediately known for her fight, but here she is.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *2-2 Simona Halep: Halep opened her service game with a bad forehand into the net and that seemed to set the tone for the remainder of the game. She hit double fault at 0-30 and then her forehand flew desperately long. A love break.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 1-2* Simona Halep: Earlier on in this match, it was Halep who was having to work desperately hard for each point, but now it’s Pliskova who is fighting tooth and nail. Some great serving from the Czech to dig out a 0-30 hold, but even so many of her first serves are coming back now. At 40-30, Pliskova hit about three violent blows that would have been winners against most other players, but she remained calm and threaded a backhand down the line winner to hold. Despite how Halep has turned this around, Pliskova is still right there.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *0-2 Simona Halep: Halep holds to consolidate her break and she has now won 8 of the last 10 games. Pliskova isn’t really playing that much worse, but Halep continues to soak up Pliskova’s biggest blows and redirect Pliskova’s missiles whenever she can. This is such an impressive effort.Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 0-1* Simona Halep: Halep’s momentum from the second set has carried into the third and she breaks with a brilliant backhand down the line return winner. Pliskova continues to attack, but Halep is soaking up so much more now and she is so good at flipping defence to offence so well on the move.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 Simona Halep: Simona Halep saves three break points to hold and level Pliskova at one set all! Even down a double break, Pliskova refused to let Halep breathe, absolutely crushing her second serve throughout that game. But Halep served just well enough to keep her at bay, taking the set with the most unexpected shot of all: a second serve ace down the T. Game on.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-5* Simona Halep: Things are moving very quickly here and the winners are now flying off Halep’s racquet. Pliskova misses some first serves, which allows Halep to further impose her game. What an incredible running backhand down the line winner from Halep to seal the double break.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 *2-4 Simona Halep: A big hold for Halep, who continues to show Pliskova that she is here to fight. At 30-30, she put just enough angle on her crosscourt backhand to push Pliskova wide and force an error. She sealed the hold by forcing another Pliskova error, this time with a heavy forehand crosscourt. She is imposing her game more and more in this set.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-3* Simona Halep: Halep is starting to find some joy by opening up the court with angles. She generates a first break point by forcing Pliskova out wide on her forehand, who sprays an ambitious forehand down-the-line wide. Pliskova saves the break point with a big serve and forehand combination, but on the second break point, Halep chases down a drop shot and takes the break with a brilliant forehand volley at full stretch.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 *2-2 Simona Halep: Pliskova breaks back to love with another emphatic return game, converted with a heavy crosscourt forehand that forced a forehand error from Halep. After all the talk about how slow this court is, it is startling to see Pliskova just uncompromisingly hitting through it today.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 1-2* Simona Halep: After opening the second set with an erratic service game, Pliskova reverts to type with another great hold. Along with more untouchable serving, she held with a fizzing down the line backhand winner.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 *0-2 Simona Halep: A very important hold from Halep to consolidate the break. She saved a break point by grinding Pliskova down in a long, attritional rally, but she was otherwise trying to impose herself well inside the baseline.Karolina Pliskova finished the first set with 11 winners to 3 unforced errors. Unplayable.Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 0-1* Simona Halep: Halep’s coach Darren Cahill was out between sets. He told Halep to forget the first set and suggested putting more spin on the ball and getting it out of Pliskova’s strike zone.She was listening. Pliskova opens the set with a couple of errors off higher balls, then she inexplicably double faults on break point to drop serve easily. This is already a different match.First set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 Simona Halep: Karolina Pliskova snaps a backhand down the line winner to break Halep for a third time and take the first set with a bagel. Just an incredible set of tennis from Pliskova, who is attacking brilliantly and moving to the net whenever she can. The bad news for Pliskova is that she now has to do it all over again.First set: Karolina Pliskova 5-0* Simona Halep: It’s clear that Pliskova’s form is stemming from how well she is serving so far. She holds with another easy service game, sealed with an ace down the T. Halep isn’t even playing badly. She just can’t live with this at the moment.First set: Karolina Pliskova *4-0 Simona Halep: More brilliant play from Pliskova as she moves up a double break. Early in the game, she crushed a backhand return then slipped into the net and she brought up break point with a whistling inside out forehand winner. She couldn’t convert the first break point, but a couple of minutes later she hooked a heavy forehand crosscourt and forced an error to take the break.First set: Karolina Pliskova 3-0* Simona Halep: That was a statement love hold from Pliskova to consolidate the break. Huge serving and there wasn’t much that Halep could do.First set: Karolina Pliskova *2-0 Simona Halep: Simona Halep did not play a bad service game, but she’s already down. Pliskova looks great so far. She is dominating the baseline exchanges, peppering her game with some variety and crushing Halep’s second serve. She breaks by eliciting a Halep error with some heavy forehands.First set: Karolina Pliskova 1-0* Simona Halep: Good start for Pliskova, who is serving well out of the blocks and already showing her variety. A great drop shot from the Czech early on, then she slammed down a trademark huge serve. She sealed the first game by moving to the net after a big forehand and picking off a nice volley.Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova are now on-court. As noted earlier, not much has separated them in recent years and Halep won a particularly delightful three-set match in the Fed Cup at the beginning of the year. Let’s see what’s in store today.As for Svitolina, she has been the player of this event by far. She hasn’t dropped a single set and the big question is whether anyone in the world still has the energy, patience and weapons to hit through her defence on these slow courts.For a dead rubber including an alternate, that was a pretty entertaining match between Elina Svitolina and Sofia Kenin. Keep an eye out for 20 year-old Kenin, who has had a brilliant breakthrough year and finishes her breakthrough season ranked 13th with a huge win-loss record of 48-22 and three titles. Kenin is pretty under the radar for a young American who will have a good shot at reaching the top 10 next season.Elsewhere, Kyle Edmund has been announced as the fifth Davis Cup player for Great Britain. Here’s Leon Smith’s statement: “I’m delighted to name Kyle as the final nominated player to our GB Davis Cup team. Whilst Kyle has had a tough few months, he showed at the Paris Masters what level of tennis he is capable of producing. It’s been a difficult decision to make as Cam Norrie has had a very good year on tour and is finishing the year ranked around number 50 in the world. It’s a strong position for our team to be in when we have such high quality players vying for selection. The same is true for Joe Salisbury who is in great form and we wish him all the best for the ATP Tour finals. I’m excited about getting our team together and preparing for the finals in Madrid.”Hello! Welcome to the final day of the round robin group stages, where we have a decisive match between longtime rivals Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova after Elina Svitolina clinched the Purple Group with a hard-fought 7-5 7-6(10) win over Sofia Kenin. Thanks to the injuries that have pillaged this event over the past three days, there hasn’t been much need to wipe the thick dust from our calculators in a desperate attempt to figure out the group scenarios. The scenario here is simple: win or die.The rivalry between Halep and Pliskova has always been good fun. Halep leads the series 7-3 and won the first three meetings without dropping a set, but Halep is 4-3 since those initial encounters. Their games contrast nicely, with Pliskova’s big serving and aggression off the ground meeting Halep’s great defence. However, Pliskova is much more patient than the average 6’2 big server and Halep has her weapons. There are always a pleasant variety of staccato points and longer, attritional rallies.The one thing they do have in common is that both players have expressed their displeasure at playing on such a slow court so late in the season. Neither could hit through Svitolina for extended periods during their earlier matches and, like seemingly everyone but Svitolina, they both seem to be feeling the physical and mental effects after another long year. With so much prize money and so many points on offer, we’ll see which player is prepared to bring their best tennis one final time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12661fa87acd10227ef5ebc41dc00f07fd7b5db7/0_235_7727_4636/master/7727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7028bf3ac77b999041aefec35b8a342d","title":"scummy mummies funniest things","story":"The standup duo and parenting podcasters on the things that make them laugh the mostHelen: Smack the Pony’s Dating Agency sketches.

Surely, the narrative goes, Harbath is a Trojan horse for the GOP, twisting and shaping Facebook’s policies in order to tilt the scales toward the Republican party in 2020.But the arguments Harbath is making for Facebook and the arguments Facebook’s critics are making about Harbath suffer from the same frustrating myopia: they view Facebook principally as an American company concerned with American politics. This narrow frame has distorted and degraded the debate over political speech on Facebook at a time when it is crucial to attempt to understand Facebook as a global phenomenon with globe-shaking power.Harbath’s op-ed repurposed a line from Zuckerberg’s Georgetown speech – a talking point already repeated many times in interviews, before Congress and to investors: “I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.”I have yet to hear Zuckerberg or Harbath offer any commentary on how this policy will affect non-American members of Facebook’s so-called “community” – and that’s not for lack of trying. I’ve asked Facebook repeatedly whether it plans to have a different policy on speech by politicians or political advertisements in non-democratic countries over the past two weeks, to no avail.This isn’t just a gotcha question. It is a matter of urgent importance, and one that speaks to what, to me, is a much more telling aspect of Harbath’s professional history: her actual work for Facebook.A blockbuster December 2017 article in Bloomberg detailed Harbath’s extraordinary track record leading “a little-known Facebook global government and politics team that’s neutral in that it works with nearly anyone seeking or securing power”. According to the report, Harbath’s staff became “de facto campaign workers” for political campaigns in some of the world’s biggest democracies they assisted Narendra Modi in India, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany, and Andrzej Duda in Poland.Two years after the article’s publication, it’s impossible not to notice that democracy has been severely degraded under the regimes that the Facebook team helped achieve power.What do Zuckerberg’s bromides about democracy mean to Facebook users in Kashmir, where Modi has blocked the internet for 13 weeks and on Thursday dissolved the constitution? What do his paeans to the free press mean to Facebook users in the Philippines, where Duterte has used his office to attempt to silence an independent journalist working to expose extrajudicial killings and human rights violations? Will Facebook update its “Success Story” about playing a “central role” in the way Duda is “innovating communication between the government and the public” as fears grow that democracy in Poland is eroding under his party’s rule?The paradox here is that Facebook is more accountable to US lawmakers and reporters than it is to any other country’s. It is incumbent on American politicians and the American press to keep this in mind – and push Facebook to answer questions about how its policies will apply to the vast majority of its users.Dispatches from Silicon Valley is a weekly column of reporting and analysis from the epicenter of the tech industry.

The woman was then flogged with a rattan cane 23 times.The organisation for which Mukhlis works advised the local government and legislature on drafting and implementing Aceh’s religious law, including public flogging.It was not immediately clear what he did for the agency.The council made headlines this summer when it criticised plans to form a national women’s football league because Aceh did not have a special stadium where only female players, match officials and spectators would be present.In June, it issued a fatwa, or religious edict, against the online game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), saying it insulted Islam and made addicted players violent.Flogging a council member underlined the commitment to enforcing Islamic law, said the Aceh Besar deputy regent, Husaini Wahab.Mukhlis would probably be sacked under his employer’s moral code, Wahab added.Also on Thursday, a female university student was flogged a dozen times after she was caught spending the night in a boarding house with a man, who escaped punishment because he was underage.Dozens of onlookers watched the floggings, with some recording them on their mobile phones. “I was just curious to see how it was carried out,” said one spectator, Robbi.In July, three people were each flogged 100 times for having premarital sex, while last year two men caught having sex with underaged girls were also whipped 100 times.Rights groups have criticised public caning as a cruel and inhuman punishment, and Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, has called for it to end. But the practice has wide support among Aceh’s mostly Muslim population."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dbfa2b5682353b62d36790835fdc5c669bd6e6f/0_778_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e4b51e00889dc6b6b32c0a30978c136","title":"nirmal nims purja speed climber worlds 14 highest peaks everest","story":"Nirmal Purja says hardest part of his record-breaking feat was solving a diplomatic impasse with ChinaNirmal “Nims” Purja’s record-breaking ascent of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just over six months drew plaudits and astonishment at his physical feat. But for the man himself, the climbing was “the easy part”.Speaking to the  from the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, Nims said the real challenges were the logistics and fundraising.Perhaps most difficult of all was the diplomacy required to persuade the Chinese authorities to open the last mountain on his list, Shishapangma, which was closed to climbers for the year.Nims, a former Gurkha and British Special Forces member, completed the final ascent of his gruelling challenge earlier this week. Along the way he assisted in several dangerous rescues of stricken climbers, risking his own project.If there was a final issue for Nims to overcome, it was, perhaps, the least tangible: a widespread disbelief that he could really do it, despite having climbed Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in five days in 2017 and “feeling fine” – the experience that persuaded him that he could do this challenge.“No one believed it could be done. Some people made a joke out of it,” he explained, comparing his ambition to the recent successful efforts to run the world’s first sub-2hr marathon.That including lobbying the Nepalese government, as well as climbers from around the world, to intercede.“It was crazy, but I made it happen. It’s part of my Special Forces training. You’re taught to come up with a solutions, not look for excuses.”For Nims that included selling his house and resigning from his job in the Special Boat Service, after the Royal Navy said his ambitions were “too risky”.The achievement, however, has not been without controversy. Mountaineers have criticised Nims for using supplementary oxygen above 7,500m and fixed ropes. The Everest luminary Chris Bonington suggested Nims’ achievement will eventually be seen as a “footnote” in mountaineering history.But it has also been celebrated, not least by Reinhold Messner, one of the world’s greatest ever mountaineers and the first person to climb all 14 8,000m peaks. He described it as a “unique mountaineering achievement”.In the brutal world of high-altitude mountaineering, in which climbers have been known to pass stricken fellow mountaineers without offering assistance, Nims drew plaudits for twice risking his own life to help others.The first time occurred while descending from Annapurna on 23 April – a few days into his effort – when he led a rescue of fellow climber Dr Chin Wui Kin, who had been separated from an accompanying expedition and left without food, water or oxygen for 40 hours. He later died in hospital. Less than a month later on 15 May, having made it to the summit of Kanchenjunga in just 21 hours, Nims and his team rescued a further two climbers from a height of 8,400m, sacrificing their own supplementary oxygen to the climbers in need.“For me it’s not about ego,” he said, explaining why he would put himself and his project at risk. “It’s about principles. You can’t call yourself a climber and not help in that situation.”For most non-Himalayan climbers, Nims first came to wider international attention earlier this year, when a picture he took of crowding on Everest’s summit ridge went viral.Although he describes arguments that took place among climbers trying to ascend and descend through the bottleneck, he said he was personally “not fazed” by the experience, despite being slowed for hours on his summit day.He hopes too that the international attention now focussed on his climbs will bring a higher profile to Nepalese mountaineers whose efforts are too often eclipsed by media coverage of western climbers.“Nepalese guides get forgotten in the story often. Let’s give credit to Nepalese climbing. I hope what I have done can come to be seen as an example of what can be done and what is possible for Nepalese mountaineering.”For the future, he has his eye on one of the great remaining prizes of 8,000m Himalayan climbing: a winter ascent of the world’s second highest mountain and the only Himalayan giant not yet climbed in that season, Pakistan’s K2.Nims said he would not be surprised if someone climbs the 14 mountains faster.“Records are made to be broken. Someone one day will come along and be stronger. People are only limited by their imagination. If you don’t dream then you won’t do it. Human beings are capable of doing amazing things.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Eight cyclists have died on Irish roads so far this yearDefendant pays over \u0026euro20,000 in compensation to Clayton and donates sum to charityUFC fighter has paid compensation to victim of attack, court heard\u0026lsquoShe has been through an incredible amount but we\u0026rsquore a democratic party\u0026rsquoEamon Harrison (23) allegedly delivered trailer carrying 39 migrants to Zeebrugge PortInvestigating officers urge men to hand themselves in to PSNIRain and wind warnings in place for Friday and SaturdayKaren Harrington charged with the murder of Santina Cawley in July\u0026lsquoMs P\u0026rsquo was kept on life support for four weeks due to concerns about Eighth AmendmentAuthority said stallion seized while wandering on road and killed as fees not paidConcern that \u0026lsquooutside forces\u0026rsquo are \u0026lsquopiggybacking\u0026rsquo on local protestsViolent protests forced Chilean government to cancel December\u0026rsquos COP25 meetingUniveristy president says \u0026lsquo revolution in teaching styles and philosophies\u0026rsquo is future of third-levelDublin Fire Brigade reports no injuries caused by fireworks or bonfires so far tonightGarda\u0026iacute arrested suspect after making dozens of \u0026lsquopurchases\u0026rsquo of controlled substancesMan was driver and sole occupant of car which entered sea at about 8pm Thursday nightGarda\u0026iacute appealing for witnesses following discovery of body in Tousist, Kenmare last weekBailey tells party colleagues her career and livelihood are on the lineIrish Rail calls for Se\u0026aacuten Fleming to correct record over remarks on use of card by company"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.Independent schools value for money - GCSE boarding (behind subwall)What we foundParents are paying more than £27,000 a year to send children to a private school where just 12 per cent of their GCSE exams will be awarded top grades, according to our analysis.Bellerbys College London, which charges £9,020 per term for day pupils, has emerged as one of the most expensive day schools in the country but where pupils achieve among the lowest proportions of As and A*s, or grades 7-9, in GCSEs compared with other fee-paying institutions.  Among the most costly boarding schools was DLD College in London, where fees are £17,666 a term but just 28.07 per cent of GCSEs are awarded top grades.The college was established in 1931 to provide tutoring for prospective applicants for Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as those preparing for Colonial Service entrance exams.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsSearch for the best independent schools for 2019 A-level resultsSearch for the best grammar schoolsMeanwhile, Badminton School was identified as one of the best value boarding schools as it had one of the highest proportion of top exam grades but among the lowest fees.At the all-girls school in Bristol, which charges £5,475 a term for day pupils and £10,765 for boarders, 77 per cent of pupils achieved A-A*s or 7-9s in their GCSEs this year.Rebecca Tear, the headteacher, said that her pupils do not just “jump through exam board hoops”, but get a “hands-on” approach to their education. “It’s all about community here,” Mrs Tear said.  “Within the community the girls know one another, the older and younger girls, they know the teachers, and you’ve got really strong relationships both in and out of the classroom.“I really strongly believe that to learn, you have to be a little bit uncomfortable, you have to go through your comfort zone and push yourself.  Here, because we’re all so familiar, they are prepared to take those risks, to ask their teachers and ask each other.”The school, which was founded in 1858, counts Indira Gandhi, the first female Prime Minister of India and the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnae.Badminton School in Bristol counts the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnaeWinchester College, Charterhouse and Wellington College were among the top five most expensive day schools.Winchester College, an all-boys school which charges £13,304 per term, had the best results out of the three with 87.3 per cent of GCSEs awarded top grades. Private schools have come under pressure in recent years for hiking fees. “The danger the sector is in is that it has lost the middle class,” said Martin Stephen, the former headmaster of St Paul’s Boys’ School.“Part of the reason is as simple as the fact that they have been able to put the fees up and not reduce the number of applicants.”At Winchester College,  87.3 per cent of GCSES were awarded AA* or 7-9 this yearBarnaby Lenon, the chair of the ISC and a former headmaster at Harrow School, agreed that the biggest threat for private schools is “if they don’t hold their fees down”.He said: “Although it is true that the average fee has risen faster than salaries  - which is not a good thing - nevertheless there are still a pretty large number of schools with fees around £14,000.“Secondly now many more women work so there is more money available to pay fees than in the old days when often mother did not work. Schools have greatly increased the number of bursaries which are available for families who can only afford half or three quarters of a fee.“I totally agree that independent schools have to watch out that they don’t price parents out of the market, they are very aware of that and have made a huge effort to hold fees down.”Mr Lenon said there had been a growing realisation among parents that the relationship between exam results and success in life is not as strong as people once thought. He explained that with half the population now going to university, the premium attached to it has been slightly reduced. And with the growing number of problems with pupil mental health, this is something parents care about more, he said. Let\u0027s face it if you ask parents what they want most for their children, the first thing they will say is not results. It\u0027s that they are happy, make good friends, are safe and secure.Barnaby Lenon is a former headmaster at Harrow SchoolBellerbys College and DLD College both said that the majority of their pupils are from outside of the EU, and do not speak English as a first language.“Arrival at Bellerbys is often their first time away from home, meaning they have to make academic, cultural and language adjustments,” a spokesman for Bellersby College London said.“We specialise in caring for these young adults, tutoring them and preparing them for university entry and the future world of work. 399 of our 2019 graduates progressed to a top 50 UK university. We\u0027re extremely proud of every cohort.DLD College said they work with a number of students who have found education “challenging”, and success cannot be measured by looking grades alone.“Our students enjoy five-star, secure and safe boarding in the same building with a strong co-curricular programme to match, a spokesman said. “For these reasons, the cost of boarding in this part of London cannot be easily compared with the cost of a boarding school in other locations.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

That means agriculture, hydroelectric dams, borders,” he predicted.The future of lucrative oil fields currently under SDF control in the east is uncertain, however.While they would be a major boon for the government, which has had to rely on Tehran for much of its oil in recent years, the US sent several hundred troops back into Syria last week to guard them. Assad said he respected President Donald Trump\u0027s transparency in his bid for oil in the Middle East, a quality lacking in his predecessors, he claimed.He is the best American president, not because his policies are good, but because he is the most transparent president, he said. All American presidents ... project themselves as defenders of human rights and noble and unique American values.  The reality is that they are a group of criminals who represent the interests of American lobbies, i.e. the large oil and arms companies, and others.Decision on Huawei 5G access delayed until after election amid \u0026#39hostile state\u0026#39 security concerns Armistice Day 2019: Poppies, commemorations and why the act of remembrance mattersGeneral election latest news: Nigel Farage pitches \u0026#39Leave Alliance\u0026#39 with Tories as Brexit Party launch campaignDancing through the pain: Is a stricter Strictly leading to injuries being the new \u0026#39curse\u0026#39?Comment: How ironic if the Farage show ended up destroying Brexit altogether\tElection wargaming: Boris Johnson taking \u0026#39enormous gamble\u0026#39 in hoping Brexit gains will balance out Remain lossesBBC Springwatch in sexism row over bird box kit which suggests mums are better at making nests and dads are better at DIYWhen is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? Indonesian man flogged for adultery under law his organisation helped draftSilver Spitfire pilot log weeks 8 and 9: calmer skies ahead as our men escape the chaos of typhoon seasonEssex lorry deaths: Northern Irishman arrested in Dublin Nicola Sturgeon: Jeremy Corbyn would cave in over second independence referendum next yearTerrorist propaganda and gruesome execution videos should be banned under new laws, London Bridge coroner recommendsComment: Donald Trump is entirely wrong about the Boris Johnson deal\tIndiana woman found dead with 8-foot python around her neck in home filled with snakesComment: A \u0026#39Unite the Right\u0026#39 campaign may be the best path to a Brexit majorityIs Britain already in a cyber war?\u0026#39None of this would have been possible without Nigel Farage\u0026#39 -  readers on this week’s top stories Nine things you never knew about Guy FawkesThe story behind Bonfire Night and Guy Fawkes: Gunpowder, treason and plotDonald Trump\u0026#39s issues with the Brexit deal - and one possible route around them We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gchq 100 crack exclusive telegraph code join secret gathering","story":"Defence and Security CorrespondentMinistry of DefenceFor 100 years GCHQ has been fulfilling its mission to keep the UK safe.  Its codebreakers are the hidden heroes tackling the biggest threats to the country. And now, readers, you have a chance to try your hand at cracking a two-part code and joining me, the Defence Correspondent Dominic Nicholls, at a subscribers-only drinks reception to celebrate the centenary of this magnificent organisation.Below is a code specially created for the .

The staff of around 60 German linguists, mainly young women, were employed to live log the communications.This type of interception had never been done before for voice communications and the tactical nature of the information collected by the young women helped to protect British pilots and sailors.Tony Comer, GCHQ’s historian, told the  that the role needed people who had a good ear, could rapidly interpret and understand what was happening. They needed to “get the information out in as near real-time as possible,” he said, describing them as the “live bloggers” of their day. Abbots Cliff House is available online for nearly £2,000 a nightThe property’s current owner has already become acquainted with its rich history after being visited by several women who were stationed there for RAF decoding work during the war.Stephen Lucas, 58, claimed a bricked-up room in the basement was also reputed to hide abandoned surveillance equipment.Recalling his recent visit from the RAF decoders, He said: “They told us some stories about Churchill visiting the property - they weren’t allowed to salute him or anything - everyone was in civvies and the house was camouflaged, it was wonderful.”He added: “A lot of guests are really interested in it.”The covert past of the site has been revealed along with four others to mark the 100th anniversary of GCHQ.Director Jeremy Fleming said the past century has seen GCHQ “save countless lives, given Britain an edge, and solve and harness some of the world’s most complex technological challenges”.At the outbreak of war the Government Code and Cypher School, GCHQ’s original name, had 200 staff working at Bletchley Park and Mansfield College in Oxford.By December 1944 there were 10,000 people working at Bletchley Park and another 20,000 in outstations throughout the UK.Decision on Huawei 5G access delayed until after election amid \u0026#39hostile state\u0026#39 security concerns Armistice Day 2019: Poppies, commemorations and why the act of remembrance mattersGeneral election latest news: Nigel Farage pitches \u0026#39Leave Alliance\u0026#39 with Tories as Brexit Party launch campaignDancing through the pain: Is a stricter Strictly leading to injuries being the new \u0026#39curse\u0026#39?Comment: How ironic if the Farage show ended up destroying Brexit altogether\tElection wargaming: Boris Johnson taking \u0026#39enormous gamble\u0026#39 in hoping Brexit gains will balance out Remain lossesBBC Springwatch in sexism row over bird box kit which suggests mums are better at making nests and dads are better at DIYWhen is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? Indonesian man flogged for adultery under law his organisation helped draftSilver Spitfire pilot log weeks 8 and 9: calmer skies ahead as our men escape the chaos of typhoon seasonEssex lorry deaths: Northern Irishman arrested in Dublin Nicola Sturgeon: Jeremy Corbyn would cave in over second independence referendum next yearTerrorist propaganda and gruesome execution videos should be banned under new laws, London Bridge coroner recommendsComment: Donald Trump is entirely wrong about the Boris Johnson deal\tIndiana woman found dead with 8-foot python around her neck in home filled with snakesComment: A \u0026#39Unite the Right\u0026#39 campaign may be the best path to a Brexit majorityIs Britain already in a cyber war?\u0026#39None of this would have been possible without Nigel Farage\u0026#39 -  readers on this week’s top stories Bashar al-Assad says Syrian regime to take back all Kurdish held areas in new interviewNine things you never knew about Guy FawkesThe story behind Bonfire Night and Guy Fawkes: Gunpowder, treason and plotWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/11/01/TELEMMGLPICT000214659608_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7GgL7o0_ESnuLxJzSWOePQE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"isils new leader abu ibrahim al hashemi al qurayshi has inherited","story":"Baghdadi left behind a jihadist empire in tattersWhen Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself the caliph of the Islamic State in 2014 he did so in front of the world from the al-Nuri mosque in the city of Mosul, the crown jewel of a jihadist empire which at the time stretched across Iraq and Syria. His successor’s coronation had none of that grandeur. The man known by the nom de guerre Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi takes over a caliphate of ashes.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together.

Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.When will Apple TV+ launch?\u0026nbspApple TV+ will be available\u0026nbspin over 100 countries, including the UK, on 1 November.\u0026nbspTo subscribe to Apple TV+, users will need to have iOS 12.3 or later, tvOS 12.3 or later and macOS Catalina.\u0026nbspApple TV+ will cost £4.99 a month in the UK and $4.99 in the US for a family package, coming with a seven-day free trial starting on 1 November.Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon to earn $40m from new TV seriesNetflix to spend $500m on new UK-made films and TV showsPrince Harry and Oprah to partner on mental health series for Apple TVCustomers who purchase any iPhone,\u0026nbspiPad, Apple TV, iPod touch or Mac after 10 September are\u0026nbspofferd\u0026nbspone year of Apple TV+ for free.Through Family Sharing, up to six people can share one Apple TV+ subscription.Which TV shows and films will be available to stream on Apple TV+?The service will include a range of original Apple series, with one of the first being The Morning Show, which stars\u0026nbspJennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.It was recently revealed that Aniston and Witherspoon will earn $2m per episode.\u0026nbspSee, meanwhile, is a science fiction series set 600 years in the future featuring Jason Momoa\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspFor All Mankind\u0026nbspis an alternate history of the moon landings.In December, mystery drama Truth Be Told starring Octavia Spencer and Aaron Paul will land on the platform.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.In the reboot, the Angels are sent on an assignment to handle\u0026nbspdangerous new technology after a whistleblower alerts them to its existence.The film will be released in the UK on 29 November 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If anything, we’ve advanced even further considering our tech is far more sleeker than the clunky machinery seen in the film.Then there’s the matter of climate change. Just like in the rain-soaked\u0026nbspBlade Runner, we’re hurtling towards a natural disaster – although we’re hoping things won’t get as bad thanks to activists like Greta Thunberg.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.35 great films that bombed at the box office Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.135 Children of Men (2006)While it\u0027s now revered as one of the best films of the 21st century, Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s dystopian thriller failed to make its money back at the box office at its time of release in 2006.235 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988)This Robin Williams comedy grossed just $8m against its $46m budget, losing the studio a staggering $38m.Ali opened in the US on Christmas Day, 2001, and grossed a total of $87.7m worldwide – and still lost an estimated $63.1m.435 The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Andrew Dominik\u0027s lyrical western only just made back half of its $30m budget in 2007, but found love upon its release on DVD.Despite starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, this drama was a certified bomb at the box office, making a total of $19.6m from a $75m budget.Steven Spielberg\u0027s Roald Dahl adaptation grossed just $183m against its $140m budget – a low profit by Disney\u0027s standards.Michael Mann\u0027s cyber thriller was a box office bomb, earning only $19.7m at the box office against a budget of $70m.Just like Ridley Scott\u0027s original flopped, this lengthy sequel from Denis Villeneuve grossed just $259m worldwide and is considered a flop.This Orson Welles film may be a beloved classic, but at the time release, it failed to recoup its costs at the box office. Spike Lee\u0027s Clockers saw one of the director\u0027s most disappointing performances at the box office, taking just $13m from a $25m budget.Peter Berg\u0027s real-life drama fell more than $30m short of its $156m budget, a shame considering it\u0027s one of the Friday Night Lights creator\u0027s best films to date.Donnie Darko grossed just over $7.5m worldwide on a budget of $4.5m, not helped by its marketing campaign featuring a plane crash weeks before 911.Upon release, this cult horror was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7m on a $60m production budget.There was something of a controversy surrounding David Fincher\u0027s Fight Club, which aided in making a modest profit of just under $40m at the box office. It\u0027s opening run, though, was markedly underwhelming.While far from being a catastrophic flop, The Good Dinosaur struggled to reach the heights of other Pixar releases. The film grossed $332m worldwide against a $175m budget.This entertaining 1990s thriller had such poor box office takings in the US, it was released straight-to-DVD in other countries, including the UK.Michael Cimino\u0027s drama is notable for being one of the biggest box office bombs of its time, losing the studio an estimated $37m (over $114 million when adjusted for inflation).Martin Scorsese\u0027s charming family film was a commercial failure, grossing just $185m against its $150–$170m budget.While acclaimed by critics, Michael Mann\u0027s drama – starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe – never made back its $68m budget.Despite being one of the best animated films of all time, The Iron Giant was a victim of Warner Bros scepticism towards the genre after the failure of previous effort, Quest for Camelot. Future Pixar director Brad Bird\u0027s film made $31.3m worldwide against a budget of $70–80m.While not a major flop, the classic underperformed at the Christmas box office due to stiff competition from other big films.Elaine May\u0027s maligned comedy, which is being reassessed with every passing year, became a notorious failure at the box office.2335 The King of Comedy (1982)Although Scorsese\u0027s drama was well-received by critics, it bombed at the box office. Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meant that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.135 Children of Men (2006)While it\u0027s now revered as one of the best films of the 21st century, Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s dystopian thriller failed to make its money back at the box office at its time of release in 2006.235 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988)This Robin Williams comedy grossed just $8m against its $46m budget, losing the studio a staggering $38m.Ali opened in the US on Christmas Day, 2001, and grossed a total of $87.7m worldwide – and still lost an estimated $63.1m.435 The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Andrew Dominik\u0027s lyrical western only just made back half of its $30m budget in 2007, but found love upon its release on DVD.Despite starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, this drama was a certified bomb at the box office, making a total of $19.6m from a $75m budget.Steven Spielberg\u0027s Roald Dahl adaptation grossed just $183m against its $140m budget – a low profit by Disney\u0027s standards.Michael Mann\u0027s cyber thriller was a box office bomb, earning only $19.7m at the box office against a budget of $70m.Just like Ridley Scott\u0027s original flopped, this lengthy sequel from Denis Villeneuve grossed just $259m worldwide and is considered a flop.This Orson Welles film may be a beloved classic, but at the time release, it failed to recoup its costs at the box office. Spike Lee\u0027s Clockers saw one of the director\u0027s most disappointing performances at the box office, taking just $13m from a $25m budget.Peter Berg\u0027s real-life drama fell more than $30m short of its $156m budget, a shame considering it\u0027s one of the Friday Night Lights creator\u0027s best films to date.Donnie Darko grossed just over $7.5m worldwide on a budget of $4.5m, not helped by its marketing campaign featuring a plane crash weeks before 911.Upon release, this cult horror was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7m on a $60m production budget.There was something of a controversy surrounding David Fincher\u0027s Fight Club, which aided in making a modest profit of just under $40m at the box office.

The film grossed $332m worldwide against a $175m budget.This entertaining 1990s thriller had such poor box office takings in the US, it was released straight-to-DVD in other countries, including the UK.Michael Cimino\u0027s drama is notable for being one of the biggest box office bombs of its time, losing the studio an estimated $37m (over $114 million when adjusted for inflation).Martin Scorsese\u0027s charming family film was a commercial failure, grossing just $185m against its $150–$170m budget.While acclaimed by critics, Michael Mann\u0027s drama – starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe – never made back its $68m budget.Despite being one of the best animated films of all time, The Iron Giant was a victim of Warner Bros scepticism towards the genre after the failure of previous effort, Quest for Camelot. Future Pixar director Brad Bird\u0027s film made $31.3m worldwide against a budget of $70–80m.While not a major flop, the classic underperformed at the Christmas box office due to stiff competition from other big films.Elaine May\u0027s maligned comedy, which is being reassessed with every passing year, became a notorious failure at the box office.2335 The King of Comedy (1982)Although Scorsese\u0027s drama was well-received by critics, it bombed at the box office. Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meant that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.Blade Runner is based on Philip K Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which was first published in 1968.A\u0026nbspsequel to Scott’s film, set in 2049, arrived in 2018.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK – so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK – so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned.

Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Clarke is playing the master of Jordan College in the new adaptation of Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy.\u0026nbspThe series also stars Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy, David Suchet and James Cosmo.His Dark Materials will premiere on BBC1 on 3 November 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.”The move follows a warning from the European Commission that there was “evidence of coordinated inauthentic behaviour aimed at spreading isive material on online platforms”, and that “malign actors constantly change their strategies”.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

Banning political ads on digital channels does feel like taking a step back to traditional media, so limiting the targeting of political ads seems like a better option for Facebook,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“The question Facebook is asking is how far should businesses like Facebook be able to censor opinions and news?”Mark Zuckerberg’s secret plan to crush TikTokOne of those calling for Facebook to be more open and transparent about the spread of disinformation across the social network is the Open Knowledge Foundation, a non-profit organisation that promotes the sharing of free information.“Twitter’s decision is very welcome and sends a strong signal to other social media giants. It will go a considerable way to preventing the spread of disinformation and ‘fake news’,” said Catherine Stihler, chief executive of the Open Knowledge Foundation.However, she warned that more needs to be done to prevent disinformation campaigns from blighting the December’s election, forthcoming elections across Europe, and next year’s US Presidential election.“Facebook must act on the growing demands for greater transparency,” Ms Stihler added. “Social media giants must work to build a fair, free and open digital world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even one of the small number of ecclesiastical objects in the hoard appears to have been of a potentially military character.The hoard was made up of golden fittings from up to 150 swords, gold and garnet elements of a very high status seax (fighting knife), a spectacular gilded silver helmet, an impressive 30cm-long golden cross, a beautiful gold and garnet pectoral cross,\u0026nbspa probable bishop’s headdress – and parts of what is likely to have been a portable battlefield shrine or reliquary.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe extraordinarily ornate bishop’s headdress is the world’s earliest surviving example of high status ecclesiastical headgear.Dating from the mid-seventh century AD, its presence in an otherwise predominantly military hoard suggests that its ecclesiastical owner may well have been performing a supporting role on a battlefield.\u0026nbspSignificantly, the headdress bears no resemblance to later medieval or modern bishops’ mitres – and is therefore likely to trigger debate among historians as to its stylistic origins because it looks so\u0026nbspsimilar in basic design to headdresses believed by early medieval clerics to have been worn by biblical Jewish high priests and also resembles headdresses worn by pagan Roman priests.The discovery may therefore prompt scholarly speculation that the style of headwear worn by senior Christian priests in the early medieval period could have been at least partly inspired by perceived biblical precedent\u0026nbsp– or may even have been inherited from the\u0026nbsppagan Roman past.The headdress – made of beautifully crafted gold, inlaid with garnets and white and dark red glass – dates from the period when Christianity was being re-established across many of the local kingdoms that would eventually become England.It represents the status and prestige of the\u0026nbspChurch – but, significantly, it is decorated with\u0026nbsptypical pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon semi-abstract animal designs as well as seven Christian crosses.If indeed the archaeologists are right in believing it to be potentially an early-to-mid-seventh century bishop’s headdress, it would have been worn, perhaps during royal or other\u0026nbspceremonial events, by the first or second generation of clergy involved in the re-Christianisation of what is now England.The portable shrine – potentially presided over by the owner of the headdress or a similar senior cleric – was probably designed to be carried into battle on two horizontal poles (like a litter or later sedan chair) – in order to obtain God’s help in securing military victory.Only seven elements of the shrine, all made of gold, have survived.One element (probably part of a cross) bears a highly significant inscription – a quotation from the Book of Numbers. It reads “Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee”.Its biblical context is that of Moses uttering these words alongside the Ark of the Covenant accompanying the Israelites in their journey across the wilderness, threatened by hostile tribes. The nature of the inscription suggests that the precious shrine or reliquary (in Latin,\u0026nbsparca) had probably been used as a war talisman in the long and bitter conflicts between warring kingdoms in early Anglo-Saxon England.The ecclesiastical treasures and secularmilitary items appear to have been treated in a potentially disrespectful way before they were buried. They had been broken andor folded and deliberately bent out of shape.\u0026nbspBack in the mid-seventh century, southeast Staffordshire (the area near Lichfield where the material was found) was controlled by a powerful pagan Anglo-Saxon king called Penda.His geopolitical and military activity formed a major part of the bloodsoaked rivalry and conflict between his own kingdom (Mercia) and other, often Christian, kingdoms in other parts of England – especially in Northumbria and East Anglia.Given the probable mid-seventh century date of the burial of the treasure, it is therefore possible that it was war booty captured by the pagan Mercian king, Penda, from armies led by Christians, such as the East Anglians.\u0026nbspOne possible explanation is that the treasure was ritually buried as a Mercian pagan war trophy – perhaps even as a thanks offering to a pagan deity for delivering victory.Putting Christian material into the ground in such a way may have been seen by Penda (or an equivalent figure) as a spiritual or ideological victory over Christianity to mirror a military one.\u0026nbspThe 10-year investigation into the hoard has involved detailed scientific examination of the metalwork, exhaustive art historical assessment of the stylistic and iconographic aspects of the artefacts and research into the potential historical contexts of its burial.However, now that the material has been fully published, there is likely to be an ongoing debate as to the most likely historical narrative or narratives that led to so much gold and silver being buried almost 1,400 years ago in a field in Staffordshire.Scholars would love to know who originally owned the bishop’s headdress, the portable battlefield shrine and the golden helmet. But sadly the reality is that it may never be possible to definitively solve those particular mysteries.However, there are potential candidates for the sort of iniduals who may have been their original owners.At around the time that the headdress was made, East Anglia was being Christianised, by the area’s first bishop a French cleric called Felix. It is therefore conceivable that the headdress was commissioned by him.His successor as bishop was a man called Thomas, an East Anglian of possible Celtic British origin, and he would certainly be a candidate for the inidual the Mercians actually captured the headdress from – because he died, potentially in battle, around the time that the East Anglian kingdom was defeated by Mercia.\u0026nbspThe gilt silver helmet almost certainly belonged to an Anglo-Saxon royal figure.Staffordshire Hoard to stay in Britain for good“It potentially adorned the head of a king of East Anglia,” said one of the Staffordshire hoard book authors, archaeologist Chris Fern of the University of York.“It is even more spectacular than the famous early seventh century helmet unearthed at the Anglo-Saxon royal burial site at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, 80 years ago.“Such helmets were the equivalents of royal crowns in Anglo-Saxon England,” said Mr Fern.But perhaps one of the most fascinating questions raised by the Staffordshire Hoard is what inspired the strikingly unusual design of the probable bishop’s headdress. Was it biblical precedent – or ancient Roman priestly headgear? If the latter, it would suggest a potentially significant additional aspect of continuity between pagan Imperial Rome and early medieval Christianity.One avenue of future research may well be linguistic rather than purely archaeological or historical.Despite the fact that\u0026nbspbishops are depicted bare-headed in Anglo-Saxon art, unpublished linguistic research by Anglo-Saxon clothing and textiles specialist Professor Gale Owen-Crocker suggests that early Anglo-Saxon bishops did indeed wear headgear known as a hufe.Her research suggests that the Latin word for a bishop’s hufe was flammeolum or flammeum. Intriguingly, the pagan Roman priests, whose headgear may potentially have been the original inspiration for the type of bishop’s headdress in the Staffordshire Hoard, were known as the Flamines – and that suggests a potential and tantalising link.The ecclesiastical material all appears to date from the second quarter of the seventh century – and to have been buried some time in the third quarter of that century.The Christian and secular artefacts are being described in full for the first time in the newly-published book\u0026nbspThe Staffordshire Hoard: An Anglo-Saxon Treasure.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe treasure is on display at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke on Trent. Although it is conceivable that it was interred for pagan ritual purposes, it is also possible that it was buried for safekeeping – and that its owners never returned to retrieve it.The research into the Staffordshire Hoard has been funded by Historic England.Its chief executive, Duncan Wilson, said: “The range of fascinating objects discovered has given us an extraordinary insight into Saxon craftsmanship and culture and this new monograph gives in-depth detail of everything we know about this spectacular discovery.”To supplement the newly published book, the public can now access a new online information and picture database about the Staffordshire Hoard.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It opens up a new area of study,” he said.Created with Sketch.Space as seen from a grandmother\u0027s garden Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Captured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeBlack holes have such powerful gravitational pulls nothing – including light – can escape. They form when stars die, shrink and then explode. Neutron stars are small dense starts that form when stars die and collapse.\u0026nbspFor years astronomers only knew about black holes that were between five and 15 times the mass of the sun. If neutron stars were above 2.5 times the mass of the sun, scientists believe they would collapse into a black hole.\u0026nbspIn 2017 scientists used Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory\u0026nbspto spot two black holes merging together in a galaxy 1.8 billion light years away. One black hole was 31 times the mass of the sun and the other was 25 times its mass.\u0026nbspAlexei Leonov: Cosmonaut who made the first space walkVirgin Galactic reveals Under Armour suits for space touristsThis showed that black holes could have larger masses than ever recorded before.Researchers suspected this meant black holes could also be discovered that\u0026nbspwere somewhere between the size of the biggest neutron star\u0026nbspand smallest black hole.\u0026nbspAstronomers\u0026nbsplooked through data collected from\u0026nbspthe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment,\u0026nbspwhich collected light spectra from around 100,000 stars in the Milky Way and discovered a low-mass black hole\u0026nbspthat was 3.3 times the mass of the sun, according to the paper published in Science.\u0026nbspProfessor Thompson said: “What we’ve done here is come up with a new way to search for black holes, but we’ve also potentially identified one of the first of a new class of low-mass black holes that astronomers hadn’t previously known about.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An AQI score between 0-50 is considered “good”, 401-500 is deemed “severe” and anything above 500 is termed a “severe-plus emergency” by the Indian government.Schools were ordered to suspend classes, as well as stopping any planned outdoors activities or sports matches.Diwali fireworks are not the main culprit of air pollution in DelhiLast elephant owner in Delhi hiding in city forest to evade policeDelhi riot police called in after parking row spirals into violenceDebris from Indian satellite blown up three months ago still in orbitDivided Delhi goes to polls in ‘battle of ideologies’Earlier in the day, Mr Kejriwal began the process of handing out 5 million free anti-pollution face masks at an event with school children, while blaming the crisis on the burning of agricultural waste in neighbouring states.“Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states. It is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air,” he tweeted.Many media reports also blamed the smog on the lighting of fireworks for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which was celebrated on Sunday.But factories, power stations and other major industrial processes also play a big part in contributing to the toxic air mix, and one which is rarely addressed by politicians.Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur said the overwhelming majority of Delhi’s pollutants come from within a 75km radius of the capital, and suggested that measures like Mr Kejriwal’s “odd-even” traffic scheme were being implemented too late.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour. Butlow-paid workers were stopped from working  hours a week rather than the current average of , it would mean a substantial cut in pay for millions of people.That Theresa May was unable to win an outright majority against Jeremy Corbyn and his extreme economic policies in  is as astonishing in retrospect as it was at the time. What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

A council parking attendant.Although the venue did hold a masked ball event — which fans think was so Banksy could attend in person without being pictured.Robert Del NajaMassive Attack songwriter Robert Del Naja, also known as D, was suspected to be Banksy — after it was thought DJ Goldie had accidentally outed him.Del Naja was a graffiti artist in Bristol before becoming a famous musician.In what would be a strange double-bluffhe was Banksy, Del Naja  was even praised by Banksy for his street art in a  interview.But in , gold-toothed Goldie was being interviewed on a podcast when he said: Give me a bubble letter and put it on a t-shirt and write Banksy on it and were sorted, we can sell it now.No disrespect to Rob, I think hes a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.Listeners believed the Rob Goldie referred to was Del Naja, but the singer has denied the claims.However, an even more intriguing theory also keeps Del Naja in the picture.Collective of artistsSome theorists reckon that Banksy, whose work has popped up all over the world, is actually a group of people instead of just one bloke.In , Scottish journalist Craig Williams theorised that Banksy could actually be a collective of artists working together under one name.He also said Robert Del Naja might be the head of such a group, citing his public friendship with Banksy and similarities in Massive Attack tour dates and the places where Banksy works have appeared.Williams wrote: A multi disciplined artist in front of one of the seminal groups in recent British history, doubling up as the planets most revered street artist.Now that would be cool.This idea of fictional artists actually came up again concerning the next suspect on our list.Thierry Guetta aka Mr BrainwashBanksys  documentary Exit Through The Gt Shop followed the bizarre rise of French artist Mr Brainwash.It was so far-fetched that some speculated that the whole thing was a ruse, and that Mr Brainwash was actually a character invented by Banksy.And, as part of the hoax, it was even reckoned that the seemingly oblivious artist who becomes an overnight success in the film was Banksy himself.But Mr Brainwash has continued to deny that he is Banksy or that his meteoric rise in the art-world was staged.Although he did mysteriously tell the LA Times: In the end, I became [Banksys] biggest work of art.Hooded man in MelbourneThe caped crusader was thought to have been caught in the act a second time in Australia in .A woman calling herself Mia S uploaded a clip to YouTube showing a graffiti artist spraying a wall in Melbourne.When she looks at his work, its signed Banksy, so she shouts out the famous street scrawlers name.But he tells her to f**k off and runs off into the night.Banksys publicist said the artwork was fake and the clip was a publicity stunt — but sceptics think this could be a  denial from Banksys team.Hooded man in BristolAnd thats not the only time Banksy has supposedly been caught on camera.Two years ago, grainy video footage resurfaced of a man spraying an underpass in Banksys native Bristol.It shows him arrive on a bicycle, spray the wall, and then clear off.The work — called Lights, Camera, Vandalism — was created for the Sunday Times Magazine in .Its thought a member of the artists team filmed the painting as part of the project.Robin GunninghamIn , the name Robin Gunningham emerged as the identity of a graffiti artist pictured in Jamaica, who was believed to be Banksy.Details of Gunninghams past, confirmed by people he attended school with and publicly available information, tallied with what was already known about the elusive artist.At the time, representatives for Banksy refused to confirm or deny that he was Gunningham - a Bristol native who attended the citys fee-paying Cathedral School.Then in , the plot thickened when researchers from Queen Mary University used geographic profiling to try and unmask Banksy.The technique paired locations which Gunningham had ties to with the sites of Banksy artworks, proving he was the most likely candidate.The Sun also previously reported that Banksy checked into a hotel in  under the name Robin.But despite the gallery of evidence, Banksy has never unveiled his true identity – and who the artist really is remains to be seen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They thoughtit really looked too bad, I could just cover it with my shoes.Seeking a reversal of fortune, Ajun sought out expert advice at Shunde Heping Surgical Hospital in the city of Foshan.His doctor, Wu Xiang, said: Its very rare to see such a serious deformity having not been treated in a -year-old patient.Doctor Wu added: Other hospitals wouldve just removed his outermost extra toes. That wouldve been the easiest solution, but it wouldnt look the best.His most natural looking toe is on the outside, so we decided to migrate it inwards to its most ideal position, replacing his fth digit and creating a new big toe.Doctor Wu and his team spent nine hours in surgery to create Ajuns new left foot.The young man revealed he was pleased with the results.He said: I stopped wearing sandals outside since my third year of primary school.Ive never had a girlfriend because Im so imperfect. I never thought Id find anyone who wants to be with me.Now I feel great. Im very grateful to Doctor Wu Xiang.I think my foot is perfect. He showed me pictures of my foot after surgery, and Im very happy.Ajun is continuing his recovery at the hospital and is expected to be discharged in the coming weeks.Surgery can happen as early as one year old, but no later than six years old.

No debate.This extremism is feeding into real-le events, including the campaign for next month’s General Election. Just look at the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn.Despite presenting himself as a kind and compassionate old bean, Corbyn and most MPs in the current Labour Party thrive on presenting society as a fight between “good” and “evil”, the “few” and “many”, with people like bankers and Tories in the latter group.At every chance they demonise anyone who strays from the progressive orthodoxy.Labour’s shouty MP David Lammy even took this philosophy so far as to compare Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit European Research Group to “Nazis” and “apartheid”.In reality, they are simply politicians who have dferent views to him.But such extreme rhetoric has become normalised among Labour. You are either on their side of the argument, or you are a fascist.Labour’s polarised world view is encapsulated in its utterly bonkers set of policies.Any sensible government knows that economic reform takes time, and is often about compromise and improving existing structures.But Labour wants to tear everything down and start again, with private schools being top of the list — no doubt because MPs have a vendetta against Etonians.Corbyn also wants to abolish Universal Credit, despite having no tangible plan for its replacement.Universal Credit is the perfect example of where Labour goes wrong. The system has had teething issues but the answer is not to burn it down, it is to make slow improvements.There are other huge, sweeping pledges the party has made, such as nationalising the railways, water, energy and mail, seizing a ten per cent stake in every private company with more than  staff and having a target of net zero for carbon emissions by .Experts have suggested this could lead to meat being rationed, cars confiscated and the wholesale closure of industries .Who cares, though,it gets Labour in charge!Much of the reason Labour has set upon these radical policies is because shaking up the system is always incredibly exciting for the young, particularlyit looks like it might bring about a few freebies.And let’s face it, it is no surprise that millennials and their younger counterparts can be enticed.They have had a rough ride since the  financial crisis, absorbing the shock of the recession and being decades away from home ownership.It is no wonder they think socialism is the answer, especially as it plays into the woke mindset of there being simple, binary solutions to everything.This is why it is so important that young people actually take on what Obama was saying about the world.The Government has to make large numbers of deeply complex decisions, where there cannot always be winners.Almost always someone will lose out in the intricate interplay that is political decision-making.There needs to be more acceptance of a Margaret Thatcher-style realism: That le is not fair.That is something youngsters do not seem to grasp these days, believing equalities can be remedied with the magic wand of socialism.Strong, long-lasting policies do not make sexy soundbites like “For the many”, nor can they be advertised in protests outside Parliament Square.

What we do has to be secret by the nature of it.“But it’s great to be able to lt the veil on occasion, and show we’re just ordinary people, living in the same places everyone  does, and have played a key part in keeping the country safe over the last  years.”GCHQ also reveal some of the crucial intelligence breakthroughs made in them that saved countless lives.Two of World War Twos’ most important discoveries took place at Ivy Farm, deep in the Kent countryside not far from the M.There, staff cracked what strange ‘noise’ was that had been heard over radiowaves – a highly encrypted teleprinter that Adolf Hitler used to communicate with his field marshals across Europe.The site was also intercepted a fax for the first time, used by the Luftwaffe to reveal bomber squadron formations to the Japanese military so they could better attack the US Air Force.Deep in central London’s club land was  Chesterfield Street, an anonymous town house that is now home to the Bahamas High Commission.For years, it was GCHQ’s nerve centre for Cold War operations, where all soviet targets were worked on by  staff.Standing on top of the White Clfs of Dover was Abbots Clf House, where  female wireless operators intercepted VHF communications from Berlin directing its E-boats in the English Channel.Today, GCHQ has just four sites that it publicly declares – its doughnut HQ in Cheltenham, listening posts in Bude and Scarborough, and the National Cyber Security Centre in Victoria.Leading tributes to the silent spies on the service’s th birthday, PM Boris Johnson said: “GCHQ has been home to some of the brightest people in the country who quietly, and without fanfare, work day and night to keep us safe“Our centenary is a chance to celebrate those achievements and to thank those men and women who have given themselves to this work.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children were expected to amuse themselves — parenting was not even a word.But then I discovered the books of Roald Dahl, and they transported me somewhere . It was when I first discovered the power of stories, something that has carried me through everything I have gone on to do. I could not have known then that one day I would be writing stories for kids myself. I did not wake up one day and decide to be a children’s writer.It came about when my son Ezra, now , asked me why Harry Potter did not just run away from the Dursleys, the Muggle family he lived with, when he was not at Hogwarts. His question got me thinking and it dawned on me it would be a good idea to write a book for children where they could choose their parents, which resulted in The Parent Agency.I enjoyed writing it and it was very successful, so I wrote more. I’m now on my sixth book and recently had the privilege of reading it to children at Fitzjohn’s Primary School in North London. It is called The Taylor Turbochaser and tells the story of -year-old Amy Taylor, who is disabled after losing the use of her legs in an accident.I did not consciously think, “I’m going to write about a child in a wheelchair”. For me the story comes first. I had an ide about a girl who loved cars, and thought it would add another dynamicshe was in a wheelchair because that would create obstacles and therefore make the story richer and more complicated.I do not think messages in kids’ books should be too upfront as it can make them dull — although ersity in kids’ books is important because it represents the world we live in. Amy is not defined by her disability. She is bright and sparky but just happens to be in a wheelchair. Humour is vital in encouraging kids to read. If you can turn something that is potentially a chore into a joy then you are halfway there.AS a child, I was a big fan of Cat In The Hat author Dr Seuss. He wrote: “The more that you read, the more things you will know.“The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.”What has become a lelong love of books began when my parents read me Dr Seuss’s Grinch stories. And as a parent I continued the cycle by reading to my two daughters.You don’t need me to tell you that reading for pleasure is a good thing.It opens doors to new worlds – down the rabbit hole, through the wardrobe door – in the company of characters who will become friends for le, such as Harry, Hermione and Ron.Books fire a child’s imagination, boost their vocabulary and help set them up for the rest of their livesThat’s why we put such an emphasis on reading in schools. So it’s fantastic to see The Sun’s free Books For Schools programme.These book boxes contain a treasure trove and are perfect for a child to read independently or with their parents.We need all our children reading books for pleasure and this is a great way for them to start.As the Big Friendly Giant might say: “This is where all dreams is beginning.”You should not talk down to children when you write for them. By eight they have a pretty sophisticated sense of humour. Children are much funnier nowadays than previous generations. They have access to the internet and some very funny TV shows.The Amazing World Of Gumball, which airs on Cartoon Network, is the funniest programme ever. Children have the ability to understand complex situations and you do not need to sanitise issues because it makes you as an adult uncomfortable. They are good at filtering out things that do not apply to them and accept discomfort better than many adults do I know there are plenty of challenges when it comes to getting kids reading.My children, Ezra and Dolly, who is now , went to state schools and I know first hand as a parent the challenges that schools face with regards to having decent facilities. But access to lots of dferent types of books is vital for youngsters. Reading well makes a massive dference to their lives in every area.Then there was Roald Dahl’s Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which I now recognise as a must-readyou want to write for kids. I am so lucky that I have been able to make a living out of telling stories, and that all stems back to the books I read as a child. Without that, I do not know what  I would have done.IT’S simple to start. All primary schools need to do is visit thesun booksforschools before Friday, November .For more information, pick up The Sun.Later this month we’ll start printing tokens in the paper for schools and parents to collect.Once they reach the target, we’ll send out a bumper pack of  Collins Big Cat books, suitable for kids in Reception and Year .Schools can register at thesun booksforschools Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailToday Patrick Tucker will deliver parcels from am to am. A -hour day. “I worked for three hours yesterday before I made a penny because of everything I’m paying out,” he says. “Often I’m working a really long day to make £ or £ profit.” The only things that stop Patrick working are when he’s gone over the mileage limit on the van – meaning he is charged more to drive it. And exhaustion. “If you’re too tired you just can’t stay awake at the wheel,” he says. “People get to a point where they can’t keep their eyes open. We shouldn’t be risking our lives to go to work.” Ken Loach’s searing new film Sorry We Missed You, is the story of millions of Patricks told through the eyes of one family, the Turners. The couple are double-waged through the gig economy – dad Ricky as a courier van driver, and his we Abbie as a ­conscientious carer whose emotionally and physically draining work doesn’t remotely fit into neat -minute visits. As the treadmill gets ever faster, the stress and financial strain builds ­intolerably, slowly pulling apart the fabric of their family.   HOSTILITY“We spoke to many Patricks making the film,” Ken says, speaking as Sorry We Missed You is about to hit cinemas. “These people never stop working, yet they can’t make ends meet.” Set in Newcastle, like I, Daniel Blake, the film carries many echoes of Loach’s masterpiece about the ­brutalisation of social security. “We felt asthe Turners could be the family on the next street, around the corner from Daniel Blake,” Ken says. “The films go together in many ways because when we were in the foodbanks researching I, Daniel Blake, we found so many there were in work – hungry because of the gig economy.” Like Tory immigration policy and the welfare state, this is another hostile environment where workers denied breaks urinate in plastic bottles. “It’s not capitalism failing, it’s capitalism working,” Ken says. Sorry We Missed You is the shameful story of so many precarious workers whose stories we’ve told in this column. The mothers working hours after giving birth or delivering parcels the day of their dad’s funeral. But most of all, it’s told in memory of the late Don Lane, the man who Ken spoke so movingly about last week on Question Time. A -year-old van driver, Don was diabetic but fined £ a day when he went to hospital appointments. On those days he earned nothing but still had to pay for his van. So, he started missing hospital appointments to avoid getting further into debt.    “He collapsed and died,” Ken says. “Now you tell me that’s justied, you tell me that’s right – that a worker is so terried to have a day off for sickness because he will be fined and he dies. That’s the gig economy, that’s what it’s doing to working people.” Loach’s genius over many years, from Kes in  to Raining Stones in  and now, has been to hold a mirror up to lives held back by exploitation and poverty. Sorry We Missed You exposes the shiny new world of the gig economy as the same old abuse of power by venal corporate interests.The film comes out today with ­critical timing – just as Britain faces a general election .This, after all, is the outsourced, zero hour Britain the Tory government has been building since .And it could be their greatest vulnerability at the ballot box because Labour has promised to radically ­overhaul the system.“Ricky is the victim of bogus self-employment,” Ken says of the film.“And the good thing is Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell understand exactly how that is working and how to put a stop to it.They also know that one way to solve Ricky’s problem is to take the post office back into public ownership and use that instead of private delivery companies. Meanwhile, for carers like Abbie, those social care jobs need to come back under direct employment, to the NHS,” Ken says. “This is what Labour will do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tories quietly vote through change","story":"NewsTories quietly vote through change that could gerrymander general electionsLabour said the change to the annual canvass, which checks the electoral roll ahead of general elections, could hit poorer and marginalised groupsShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  NOV NewsIn future, councils will no longer need to send an annual canvass form by post to all households \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Instead they will be allowed to take a light-touch approach that focuses on homes most likely to have seen a change, and also uses methods like e-mails and phone calls. The move, which is expected to save £m over  years, was voted through the House of Commons - last night with no debate thanks to the backing of Conservative MPs. A watchdog said it would improve efficiency. But Labour said there is a risk poorer or under-represented groups could be left behind and the move shouldnapost be rushed through. A party source said they were only told about the vote the day before, when many MPs were on the election campaign. Only  Labour MPs were there to oppose it.   Cat Smith, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Voter Engagement, said: Labour supports reviewing the current model of the annual canvass of electors with the aim of making it easier and cheaper to administer, especially at a time when Electoral Registration Officers are facing increasingly squeezed budgets. “However, it is essential that any changes do not jeopardise the primary purpose of the annual canvass, which is to ensure that the electoral register is as accurate as possible.“We are very concerned that there is a real risk that the proposed reform will have a detrimental impact on the accuracy of the register, particularly for under-represented groups.“This is a very signicant and complicated piece of legislation that requires proper scrutiny, and shouldn’t be rushed through days before we embark on a General Election campaign.The move would not affect the December  election but would affect future elections.    The Electoral Commission said in July that the reforms should result in greater efficiency as council officers grapple with limited resources. But the watchdog warned: However, the success of canvass reform is highly dependent on new data-sharing mechanisms and careful planning and implementation activities being completed in good time ahead of the start of the  annual canvass, which will commence from July .

Craig Williams and Kirsty Ward saved up over two years for their luxury £, ceremony, which was due to take place on October  in front of  guests.But after the tour operator went bust and left their plans in tatters, generous businesses offered their services for free.The couple swapped their vows a week later than they had planned.  The pair, who have been together for  years, had spent two years planning their special day at the luxury King Evelthon Beach Resort and Hotel on the sun-kissed island of Cyprus. Their dream wedding turned into a living nightmare just three weeks before they were due to fly when they found out Thomas Cook had ceased trading. Customer service adviser Kirsty said: “I felt sick when I heard the news about Thomas Cook. It was such a sinking feeling. We were just gutted. Despair turned to delight however when the White Hart Hotel in Harrogate, North Yorkshire offered them a free package worth over £, including a three-course wedding breakfast and drinks, room hire, accommodation and a DJ.    Hotel owner Simon Cotton then rallied other firms and the couple were offered catering, hair and make-up, flowers and entertainment for their big day worth £, - all free of charge. Despite the ceremony taking place almost , miles away from the five star resort they had previously booked, the made-up newlyweds were left feeling their big day was even bigger and better than they had originally hoped. “It has been completely manic, it has all happened so fast, the -year-old bride said. “It was an amazing day. It was probably a lot better than what we had planned.    “I’ve been completely overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by so many people and we can’t thank the people of Harrogate enough for wanting to do this for us. “We just didn’t expect anything like this at all. The couple, who live in Sheffield with their three children, got engaged when Craig, a car valeter, popped the question in Whitby in May . They immediately set about planning their dream day in the sun. Kirsty said: “We wanted to get married abroad. As soon as I saw the King Evelthon hotel in the brochure I fell in love with it.    “We did a full two yearsapos planning and had paid deposits to businesses for things like hair and make up. “The package for the wedding was £, but we paid at least £, for everything. Although the sun soaked wedding day dream was not to be, the pair tied the knot in front of  close friends and family. They were welcomed by the Mayor and Mayoress of Harrogate, councillor Stuart Martin and his we April, who presented the couple with a magnum of Champagne to help kick off their party in style. Blushing bride Kirsty also had her hair and makeup done for free and arrived at the venue in a aposs style vintage Beauford Tourer.    Kirsty added: “One minute we’re counting the cost of losing our wedding day and the next thing, we’re in the middle of organising something bigger and better than it was originally going to be. “It’s just amazing and Craig and I can’t believe how lucky we are. “We will be forever grateful to all the people who’ve been so thoughtful and kind-hearted.” Craig, , said: “I guess sometimes things happen for a reason but we had no idea upon hearing the bad news that we’d end up a few weeks later with more than we had originally planned.

Has your new-build dream home got dozens of flaws  Email webnews@mirror    They have been tackling a third of the list themselves. But now the family are calling for snagging surveys to be made mandatory to prevent other people going through the same experience. The Uptons say money should be held back after completion as an incentive for builders to ‘get it right’ in the first place. Louise, , said: “You fall in love with a place and don’t notice some of these things until you’ve moved in. We would never have expected this buying a new build. It’s been an absolute nightmare and you start regretting how much you’ve done and spent on it.    “We paid £ for a professional snagging survey as we had lost faith and think ‘what  have we missed’. They spent half a day here and found  things, but they hadn’t seen everything and, on top of that, we keep finding more. “You feel like you’re picky, but this is our family home and is going to be for the rest of our lives – or that’s what we thought. It’s something that was meant to be an exciting time, but it’s not. The stress that we’ve gone through has been awful. It’s been one of the worse times of my le and it’s reflected on our kids.” Philip, aged , added: “The worrying thing is the builders are under so much pressure to finish that they’re rushed, and problems stem from that.    “Although some of the issues have been rectied, we continue to suffer from obvious defects that should have been picked up and rectied before we moved in. “Because it’s new, people expect no issues. Some of the problems are petty and minor, but we want to make people aware of the experience we’ve had. “We were excited to get in and, don’t get me wrong, we still like the house now, but we are regretting it. If we had the money, we would have moved out already.    The issues have caused both me and my family a great cause of inconvenience and stress, as well as time off work to sort it. “Having strangers constantly coming in and out of your house to sort things means time off work and you just can’t settle. It’s time that builders are held more accountable and so I’m calling for a snagging retention.

He had time to pose for the cameras but not to talk to the staff on the frontline of our NHS. Julia Simons, a trainee at Addenbrooke’s, was prevented from telling him some home truths about the state of the health service. It is not surprising he didn’t stop to listen. She would have told him that patients are not getting the treatment they need because of nine years of cuts and creeping privatisation. And she would have told him the danger his hard Brexit plans pose to the NHS. The trade deal being proposed with the US could leave it at the mercy of American health firms.    This could push up the cost of drugs such as insulin, which are ten times more expensive in the States than in Britain. Mr Johnson is trying to con voters into believing the NHS will be safe in Tory hands. No amount of gloss and spin can hide the waiting lists at a record high, the crumbling hospitals and the shortage of staff. If the PM bothered to talk to those on the frontline he would know this.    There are already too few women in Parliament. And that number is set to fall even further after the election. A stream of prominent female MPs have decided to stand down, and many blame the hugely increased levels of abuse they receive. They are bombarded by racist and sexist comments and, all too frequently, death threats. One says she received , abusive messages in the last week alone.

Pictures show how dogs would be held in holding pens before being butchered with some even turned into bar snacks. The Cambodian slaughterhouse was processing between , and , dogs a year, according to animal welfare charity Four Paws. Dr Katherine Polak, a veterinarian at Four Paws, first heard about the slaughterhouse from local restaurants who used it as a supplier. The first thing she saw at the rural property in the Takeo province, just outside of Phnom Penh, was a dying tree with caged dogs underneath.   She told Yahoo News : “The tree was apparently in full bloom about a year ago, but it’s just been dying from all the blood and urine and faeces.“There’s a smell, there’s a stench to it, it’s really heartbreaking.” “The farmer would hit them over the head and then put their back legs into the cage,” she said. “So the other dogs would watching this, waiting for their turn.    “And then he stabs them in the throat, allows them to bleed out a bit and then he puts them in a pot of boiling water.” Selling dogs for meat often attracts a social stigma in south east Asia and Dr Polak has heard stories of the farmers being beaten to death by villagers in neighbouring Vietnam. The farmer at the Takeo province facility contacted Four Paws, pleading them to help him get out of the trade.  On October , Four Paws and Animal Rescue Cambodia entered the property and seized the surviving  dogs. These included two animals the farmer had kept since they were puppies as good luck charms. The damaged canines had been confined to cages.

success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season. Ayr’s goal from Luke McCowan came after Kerr was beaten in the air from a free-kick.The full-back, though, is honest enough to hold his hands up and says he’s doing all he can to improve that part of his game.“That’s something I need to get better at.

He is a good guy and I like working with him.”Safranko does see his future back in the UK, however, once he has done all he can to help Sepsi in the Romanian top flight.“I have always said my target is to play football in the UK – I have always seen myself going there some day because the style of football suits me.“There is also a lot of passion for the game there, I could see that at United.“The football in Romania is very dferent from Scotland – there are technical, quick players but the style is not the same.“I loved the style in Scotland, the way the referee would leave the game to play on and it was very physical.“The game there really suited me, I think.”Safranko revealed he’s kept a keen eye on United this season and says he expects them to finally get back to the Premiership.He added: “The guys who have bought the club know what they are doing and bringing in Lawrence Shankland was a fantastic move. I have no doubt about this team and I hope they go up this year.“We had the perfect team last year, in my eyes. I think now they have kept that team and added a special player to it.“Of course, I keep an eye on what the club is doing – you can’t just forget what happened last year.“We don’t get the games to watch in Romania but I do look for the results and any interviews on the internet about the club.”And he hopes to be back on the pitch at Tannadice one day, whether for United or on the opposing side after being linked with moves to Aberdeen and Hibs in the summer.“You never knowI will be back at Tannadice, le is crazy.“Whether it is with United or another team maybe it will happen but Dundee United will always be in my heart after my time there – that will not change.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d970e153c3919.99006593-e1570180930942.jpg ","title":"lawrence shankland ups and downs are part of the game utd must embrace","story":"Talisman Lawrence Shankland insists he knows what he signed up for playing for Dundee United in the Championship and is pleased to see they’re dealing with the ision’s ups and downs.United bounced back from two poor away defeats at Alloa and Queen of the South with a - win over Dunfermline at Tannadice on Saturday, with Shankland opening the scoring with his th goal of the season.The result left the Tangerines three points clear at the top of the table but, summer signing from Ayr United, Shanks knows there are more twists and turns to come.“There’s many ups and downs, probably more than other leagues,” the -year-old said.“You experience it quite a lot, you’re on a high and then there’s a bad result around the corner.“That’s just the way the league is and it’s the same for everybody. We just need to make sure that,we do get a bad result or two, we bounce back in the right way.“We did that on Saturday with a positive result and positive performance.“I knew what I was coming to, I knew I was coming to a big club in this ision especially.“I knew the objectives of the club and for myself as well.“I’m a striker soI go out there and score goals people will take to you.

That’s what we looked to do on Saturday because we knew we had a tough week ahead. It was good to go and get the victory to start the week positively.“It’ll definitely be a tough test.

Obviously the home form is a positive because you need to win as many home games as you can but we’re not going to get carried away and feel like we need to beat everybody.“We just need to turn up and do our jobs week-in, week-out and make sure that we’re performing at our best when we’re at home. vw, px\"  “If we do that, we’ll get results.“We had two disappointing results in the last two games away from home and it’s something that happens in this league.“You see teams dropping points all over the place so it is like that.“If we keep our home form good, though, and win most of our games then we can maybe afford to drop a couple away.“Obviously, we’ll look to go up to Inverness on a real grass pitch as well, which helps, and put on a performance there. But we have a big test tonight first.”Nicky Clark got the second goal against Dunfermline on Saturday after teeing up Shankland, leading the hitman to praise his colleague.“It was good to get back on the scoresheet with a tap in and I was delighted to see Clarky get his first goal and get off the mark as well.“Earlier in the season we had glimpses of playing with each other but he got injured.

defeat at home to Partick just  days ago.They dealt with everything thrown at them by the Wasps and chances continued to come at the other end with Hemmings close to grabbing a third early on, bringing a good save from MacDonald. vw, px\"  He turned provider with  minutes left on the clock as he burst past a defender and, instead of shooting, cut the ball across for the waiting Sean Mackie to roll the ball into the empty net with his first touch after coming off the bench.Manager McPake had been full of praise for the efforts of his frontman over the past few weeks eventhe goals hadn’t been flowing with none in his previous seven outings.He wasn’t too complimentary about Hemmings’ miss late on, however, as the -year-old blazed the ball over the bar with the goal gaping to pass up the chance of a treble.Despite that, it was an excellent night’s work from the striker and one that will give the Dens faithful plenty to be excited about for the rest of the campaign.With Dorrans pulling the strings in the middle, a defence looking solid and a real goal- getter in scoring form, the Dark Blues are starting to look like they mean business in the Championship title race."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Aberdeen believe they will save , additional hours every year gained from time previously spent on mini-bus journeys to and from facilities across the city.McInnes believes Cormack Park will be invaluable for the youth academy.He said: “Academy coaches and our young academy kids will now be playing and training within an environment that is conducive to learning.“That is immeasurable compared to whatNeil Simpson’s young coaches have had to put up with.“For the whole region it will be an elite arena to practice and improve which is what Aberdeen football club should have.“This facility will enable us to intensy our coaching hours and increase on-pitch time, which is crucial in the development of our players.“We have been miles behind other clubs in terms of training facilities and now it is finally here we should celebrate it.”Cormack Park is phase one of a £m development that will also incorporate a ,-seater stadium at Kingsford.That is scheduled to be completed by summer .McInnes said: “Once we get the stadium built alongside Cormack Park that will be extra special as it will be something a lot of clubs don’t have.”The Dons boss had already used Cormack Park prior to opening by showing signing targets around the site.The £m facility was key in Funso Ojo and Ryan Hedges signing for the club in the summer.The manager is confident it will also help to lure top signings in the future.McInnes said: “Not only will these fantastic new facilities assist us in attracting the best talent to the club, they will now enjoy a professional training base, offering them the opportunity to train in a high-performance environment with best-in-class football medicine, sports science and performance analysis directly on hand.“Cormack Park will allow AFC to become a beacon for footballing excellence in the north of Scotland and hopefully inspire future generations of Dons players and fans.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5db1d339442a18.51269345-406x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet xxx xxx and xxxxx are looking for a new home can you help 2","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Vulcan likes to be the boss and will need a strong experienced owner who will not let him always get his own way.He can be very excitable around people but can also be temperamental and will growl or snap when being told off.He is not suitable to be rehomed around children or other animals.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes.

The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery. We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site. Nothing will change in respect to their co-operative membership of First Milk, and we will continue to collect and pay for their milk on the same basis as before.#James Barbour, chairman of the Kintyre steering group, added: #It was the right thing to investigate all avenues to seewe could keep the creamery open in Kintyre.

That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

He moved onto Charlie Miller, where he didnrsquot get off to the best start: Charlie told his father that Melvin would be better off working as a plumber.But Charlie saw Melvinrsquos passion and decided thathe wanted to be a hairdresser he should go train with the best, so in the early s he supported Melvin so he could go to London and train at Vidal Sassoon.During his time in London he got the opportunity to work on high-profile projects such as wigs for singer Diana Ross. Other famous clients included La Toya Jackson, Dustin Hoffman and Shirley Bassey, who famously threw a shoe at him.In  he entered the first Scottish Wella Vogue competition, winning with his creation of tartan hair. He was featured in the national and international press, on national TV, and even appeared in Rolling Stone and Playboy magazines.He was asked to go to America with Vidal Sassoon but he wanted to come home so moved back to Edinburgh. With the support of his family he opened Melvin  Friends in November  on the cityrsquos Castle Street.His philosophy was always lsquoHairdressing Naturallyrsquo and he believed in using biodegradable products not tested on animals.The business expanded and he opened salons in many places including Alnwick, Peebles and several in and around Edinburgh. He even opened a salon in the Sheraton Hotel.In , Melvin became the proud father of Oliver, who filled the air with fun and laughter, having many happy times growing up.In , Melvin met Lorna through a mutual friend. They set up home together, moving near to Haddington in  and were married in , then moving the business to North Berwick in .In , their family grew with the birth of Hannah.Melvin worked in the salon in North Berwick for  years, where he had a loyal following.Many local youngsters had their first jobs in the salon and Melvin taught them as a qualied SVQ mentor and a master hairdresser in the Hairdressers Council. When North Berwick High School had a hair training salon, he held sessions on the basics of hairdressing.Many stories could be told about his days in the salon, like when golfrsquos The Open Championship was held and top player Vijay Singh came in for a cut.Melvin, not being a golfer, did not know who he was, but they got chatting and Vijay said he was here for golf, so Melvin very kindly recommended some of the courses his customers had told him about!During the early days, Melvin could be found at the townrsquos Nether Abbey Hotel sometimes as a customer but sometimes as the chef as he had a great love for cooking.Many happy times were spent there and many parties were had, where Melvin was given access to the kitchens and, along with friends, did the catering.For his th birthday, he cooked for  friends.He was also famous every year for his barbecues held at the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune during its airshow.Melvin liked people to appreciate his food he would make lunch for the girls who worked in the salon, just liking to see them eat and enjoy. He taught Hannah to cook and was so proud of what she produced in the kitchen.Added his we: ldquoMelvin was a great dad, he was fun and made sure he did fun things with his children. He was so proud of me and them, and would brag about what they had achieved, often embellishing the stories.ldquoHe was a wonderful, loving husband who really looked after me.ldquoHe grabbed le with a passion and helived every day to the full, which is a great comfort. I am so grateful to have been able to spend the last  years with him. Although he will begreatly missed, he will never be forgotten.Judy Lockhart, North Berwick Community Council chairwoman, said: ldquoNorth Berwick Community Council was extremely saddened to hear of the recent and untimely passing of Melvin Wood of Melvin  Friends.ldquoMelvin was one of North Berwickrsquos most loved characters. As well as being a superb hairdresser, he had a larger-than-le personality and was also a very talented cook.ldquoMelvin famously hosted an annual barbecue on the day of the airshow which was the calender invite of the year for many.ldquoYou could never fail to smile when in the company of Melvin and he will be sorely missed.A celebration-of-le party is being organised by his family, to be held in January."},{"url":null,"title":"meet-world-champion-josh-taylor","story":"All are welcome to go along to the pub from pm till late and show Josh their support.Diane Taylor, Joshrsquos mum, said: ldquoJosh will be bringing his trophies and belts along to the Gothenburg to see everybody.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh. However, at this time we have not been invited to join any group."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10377495.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

This has been done in what in what is normally referred to as the Queenrsquos Speech. It is in studying the contents we have to realise that the author, the Prime Minister, is someone not normally associated with either in-depth scrutiny or attention to detail. To put it another way the manestorsquos headlines do not represent the contents.Nothing is more evident than the claim to recruit , more police officers. Although this does not relate to Scotland nevertheless it is a prime example of double talk. In stating , more police in three years there is a suggestion being made that in the three-year period England and Wales will have this number of additional officers. However even the slightest amount of scrutiny lies bare the nonsense of this claim.To recruit this number in three years would require a Herculean task of actually interviewing sufficient, capable people to take up these vacancies. The interviewing process is long and arduous and with preference being given to graduates will present the police forces with a huge logistical nightmare. The normal fallout from the interview process can be up to  per cent so maybe , interviews would have to be carried out to arrive at the headline number.However, let us assume, in a spirit of charity, that somehow this task can be accomplished and the interviews completed and in three years , new officers will have been recruited. The average working le of an officer is  years so in three years ten per cent of the present force of , will have retired. Or to put it another way , officers will have left the force. So even recruiting , more officers had been accomplished, this would result in only a net gain of , additional cops. The headline and the detail simply do not add up. If Boris Johnson were looking to improve the service, then the solution would lie in increasing the budget appropriately. This he will not do.This is merely one example. However similar forensic investigation of all the contents of the Queens Speech will show that Mr Johnson is selling nothing other than fairy tales.George Kay, Burntisland.THE Herald poll which shows overwhelming support for the SNP at the upcoming General Electionis a mark of the trust voters have in the party which has been in power in Scotland for  years, and a growing realisation that Scotland will thrive as an independent European nation.While the SNP Government calmly carries on, the UK is into its third Tory Prime Minister in about as many years David Cameron didnt hang around after losing the EU referendum hed instigated, Theresa May soon found that Brexit didnt mean Brexit and we werent going to make a success of it and Boris Johnson eclipsed the pair of them by insisting that do or die, we were leaving the EU on October  and hed rather be dead in a ditch than ask for an extension. Neither Mr Johnson nor anyone  is leaving on October  and while he may not be in a ditch, Mr Johnson is certainly busy digging himself and his party into a hole.While a General Election may have been inevitable, the timing could hardly have been much worse, with the Christmas season getting into full swing and just over a week before the shortest day even holding it a few days earlier would have been helpful, particularly to the student population. And it is a huge blow that the amendment was not taken which, as is the case at Scottish elections, would have given voting rights to EU nationals living in the UK and enfranchised  and -year-olds, who will have to live with the consequences of Brexit without being given any say in the matter.I fear that we can expect Mr Johnsons General Election campaign to emulate the notorious Vote Leave campaign with pledges on the side of a bus et al, so it is encouraging that your poll indicates that Scottish voters wont be duped by this guiser of a Prime Minister and his Halloween tricks and no treats.Ruth Marr, Stirling.AS we gear up to a December election, the first economic assessment of Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal has indicated the incredibly damaging impact it will have on the UK economy.Research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchhas revealed that GDP would be . per cent lower in  yearsrsquo time under the deal, leaving the UK a staggering pound billion worse off than we had remained in the EU.This is not quite the ldquosunny uplands the Brexiters have repeatedly promised.NIESR said approval of the Prime Ministerrsquos deal ldquowould reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU. However, despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ldquohinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would bethe UK stayed in the EU.The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa Mayrsquos deal of last year.When voters mark their X in the box, these figures lay bare the economic future that faces the nation and the major impact that their choice will have.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon has agreed to a General Election to further her own political aims. Has she miscalculated  The SNP is standing on a  to cancel Brexit and allow indyref but the two are mutually exclusive. If Brexit does not take place, the foremost \"material change in circumstances\" that triggered the need for indyref disappears. Many SNP supporters who still want Brexit to happen will be in the position of having to vote for a pro-Brexit party. Those wanting to remain in both the Union and the EU can find security with the Liberal Democrats. The pro-independence position is therefore weakened and even more so as the SNPs warnings on a climate emergency might boost those voting Green.The SNP hype, up until now, is for almost a total victory in all Scottish seats to be in the bag. The expectation is being ramped up, therefore disappointment is almost inevitable. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon ought to have declined Boris Johnsons invitation after all.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.AS they say, politicians campaign in poetry but have to govern in prose. Flamboyant promises fill the airwaves, restraint only coming into play when the serious business of taking office hits home.The starting pistol for a Christmas election has been fired.This is no ordinary election where policies are put on display, allowing the electorate to vote for the party most trusted by voters. The waters have been muddied by the inclusion of Brexit on the normal agenda in the hope that the result will finally define the direction demanded by the choice of the winning party.We have two contrasting personalities leading the two main parties.Both are pale imitations of the two giants of their parties, Boris Johnson representing a Churchillian figure, Jeremy Corbyn approximating to Attlee.What cannot be denied is that this election is a battle for the soul of Britain, one side the champion of neo-liberal economics, the other verging on responsible capitalism under the guise of socialism.That is the stark choice facing the voters, who will have to wade through the murky rhetoric to work out which campaign they should choose to ensure viability for their families and personal welfare.That will mean looking beyond narrow self-interest and focusing on the broader perspective of what is better for the national interest.They will have to ignore the caricatures painted for them by the wild words of politicians hoping to depict their opponents in the worst possible light.This is a generation-defining election.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.I REFER to the ongoing furore about the career of Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservatives .I recall from a comment that one writer made that she was resigning to spend more time with her family he also pointed out that she was actually resigning to spend more time with her constituents, which she had not actually done heretofore.As the story developed, she was really to be spending more time with her consultants, Tulchan and her own consultancy company.Ms Davidson has now agreed not to accept the role with Tulchan what she will do with her own company is not known as she omitted to properly register it, and someone  has registered the domain name. Her failure to register her own company shows a distinct lack of business sense, where the Tulchan episode just shows her lack of common sense.On a related matter the Scottish Tories are producing election leaflets with her pictureshe actually stood down because she fundamentally disagreed with the Prime Minister, Boris Johnston ndash she did launch ldquoOperation Arse about his candidacy, did she not  Strange indeed that she and the Tory Party are now punting him as hard as they can.Jim Lynch, Edinburgh EH.FOLLOWING on from your article re Ruth Davidsons pamphlet to the East Renfrewshire electorate: today I received one from our local Conservative MP, well I think it was.

One loyal socialist could be overheard berating Boris ldquof***ing Johnson over something or other. The mood was set.Then came the flow of Labourly love. After several minutes of wild acclamation, the chief comrade took to the lectern to speak. ldquoWe love you Jeremy, shouted one devotee.As Jezza progressed through his speech, the audience cheered and applauded at the end of each paragraph. At this rate, the launch threatened to stretch into the evening.ldquoLabour will put wealth and power in the hands of the many Boris Johnsonrsquos Conservatives, who think theyrsquore born to rule, will only look after the privileged few.Lines like this were met with people shouting out ldquoYes!. And at other times when the party leader askedit was not too much to ask to end the Conservativesrsquo ldquogreat rip-off on public services or that people should receive a pay rise, there was an equally forceful ldquoNo! making the even feel like a religious rally.Of course, the trick or treat launch provided Jezza with an open goal: Bozzarsquos ldquodo or die October  Brexit pledge. When the hairy Leftie referred to how the PM had insisted he would rather be ldquodead in a ditch than seek a Brexit extension, one loyal socialist shouted out ldquohooray!The comradely uplt reached its height when Jezza mentioned Labours great creation, the NHS, and his allegation of a post-Brexit ldquoTrump sell-out. When he declared the health service was not for sale the audience rose up and began to chant ldquonot for sale, not for sale.The Labour chief warned his chums that the nasty Tories would fight ldquoharder and dirtier than ever before to cling onto power. When he pledged to take on the tax dodgers, the dodgy landlords, the bad bosses and the big polluters, Jezza asked the question: ldquoWhorsquos side are you on  and duly got the expected response: ldquoYours!There was more whistling and hooting from the Lavender Hill Mob when the socialist prophet declared: ldquoTogether, we can pull down a corrupt system and build a fairer country that cares for all.Arguably, Jezzarsquos best line came when he told the comradely echo chamber: ldquoWhen Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins. We all win. Not surprisingly, it prompted another standing ovation and more cries of ldquowe love you Jeremy.After the prophet closed his speech with the pay-off line, ldquoitrsquos time for real change, the audience jumped up to offer more love and devotion to the great leader and, needless to say, ultimately broke into the chant of ldquooooooh Jeremy Corbyn.As Jezza was spiritually lted up, insisting: ldquoI love doing this job, the key question to be decided is whether the adoration inside Battersearsquos Grand Hall can be replicated across the country and convey the chief comrade into the Downing St hot-seat."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10613950.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-places-keeping-vegan-food-scene-thriving","story":"Tchai-OvnaHidden down a wee cobbled lane in the heart of Glasgowrsquos West End, on entering Tchai-Ovna you would be forgiven for thinking you are stepping into a Himalayan tea room or a Turkish bazar.Tchai-Ovna was founded in  by a group of Glasgow University students tired of the prevalent alcohol culture.

For example the fact that Scotland has added around a further pound billion to its debt since  and become a ldquojohnny-come-lately Europeanwill not be up for public scrutiny.Furthermore, it would appear that tactical voting will play a major part on the outcome of the General Election with a number of people holding their noses to vote for the party which can deliver or safeguard either Brexit, Remain, the Union or an independence referendum. Under these circumstances surely the best outcome would be for an orderly Brexit and also for a Scottish referendum to be put on the back burner for at least a ldquogeneration to allow UK businessescertainty to invest for the future to the advantage of us all and not self-serving narrow nationalism either by the SNP or the Brexit Party.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.IT is timely to remind the First Minister in particular and the SNP in general that sovereignty in Scotland is vested in the people and not in parliament. It is possible to win a majority of seats in Parliament, whether Holyrood or Westminster, by obtaining the votes of a minority of the electorate or a minority of votes cast this being an insubstantial basis to demand Scottish independence.William Durward, Bearsden.SO the fates have decreed that we get an early Christmas present in the form of a General Election. While the date is clear, it is less obvious for whom one should vote where one is not already a paid-up member or ardent supporter of one party or another. It has to be said that the selection of party leaders is not overly impressive. It has to be one of the poorest list of leaders promoting election campaigns in our history.For the Conservatives we have the incorrigible Boris Johnson, who has been known to be economical with the truth on occasion. For Labour we have Jeremy Corbyn, who was once vocal in his support of Venezuela. The current tragic condition of that country illustrates how dangerous the implementation of his doctrinaire socialist policies would be for the UK.The Lib Dems have the opportunistic Jo Swinson, lacking in gravitas, who sees herself, somewhat delusionally, as the next Prime Minister. For the SNP we have the doughty Ian Blackford, the investment banker, living the le of a ldquosimple crofter. His party at Westminster basically and repetitively sings from one song sheet . Do not let us forget the ex-Ukip leader Nigel Farage, now calling the shots for the Brexit Party. In spite of all the predictions of the subsequent profound adverse effects, he would prefer to leave the European Union without a deal.While not being spoiled for choice with regard to the leadership qualities of those at the head of parties and their policies, more and more I have inclined to the view that there is a case for extending the choice available on the list of candidates on the ballot paper,by adding a box to be crossed with the wording ldquonone of the aboversquo.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.PLEASE help our memories by answering the following questions:.

Behailu Kebede, in flat , was found to be entirely blameless, having done all the right things on being woken by his smoke alarm and spotting the fire.:Clutha crash caused by pilots failure to check fuel pumps, inquiry findsHe called for help, closed the kitchen door, alerted neighbours and waited for the fire brigade. Hours later  people would be dead.What becomes more complex - and what is under dispute - is who was, then, to blame for the events of June , . There has been outrage at the suggestion the London Fire Brigade is responsible and pleas that fire fighters should not be made scapegoats for the fatal incident.At the same time there have been calls for the services chief, Dany Cotton, to resign after failures from the service to alter its \"stay put\" advice to residents inside the burning building. Sir Martins report makes clear that more could have been saved had the building being evacuated sooner.The inquirys second phase, expected to be finished in , five years after the fire, will be a deeper investigation into how the fire could have happened in the first place.Footage being shared earlier this week showed Boris Johnson in , responding to concerns raised about cuts he made to the fire service while Mayor of London, with the words \"get stuffed\". The video of the meeting, held not long before the Grenfell disaster, shows a colleague of Mr Johnson raising the issue of a lack of fire safety in housing as a result of the cuts. Get stuffed.It seems far too simplistic to blame the fire crews when, at the top, there was such utter disdain for the service and the resources needed for fire safety.:Inside Clutha pub after helicopter crash revealed as FAI rules pilot errorAt the Clutha Fatal Accident Inquiry it was clear from the start that families of the victims who died when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of the Glasgow pub did not want the pilot to face sole blame.Instead, they wanted to know whether there had been systemic failings at the top - was there a problem with the helicopter  Had there been problems with training or management or maintenance It was a far cry from the last major Fatal Accident Inquiry in the city when automatic sympathy for the driver of a bin lorry that ran out of control on Queen Street and killed six people quickly turned to disgust as it became apparent he, Harry Clarke, had lied about previous health problems.Yet in the one case where blame did appear to sit with the man at the bottom, rather than come from the top down, Mr Clarke faced no criminal charges.While suspicion of pilot error had been an immediate suggestion and then constant explanation almost since the day of the crash, the Clutha families, and bar owner Alan Crossan, were clear that they did not simply want Captain David Traill to take the blame for the deaths of their loved ones.Captain Traills fianceacutee Lucy Thomas was represented at the inquiry, which ran from April to August this year, and her QC, Shelagh McColl, asked that Captain Traill - an \"extremely accomplished and experienced pilot\" - not be blamed for the crash.Sherf Principal Craig Turnbull could not give her what she asked for. His findings stated that the crash could have been avoided had Captain Traill followed procedure set down in the Pilots Checklist, realised that two fuel transfer pump switches were \"off\" and so not sending fuel to the supply tanks, and switched these on.Had the switches been turned on, there was enough fuel on board to feed the twin engines and the helicopter would have made it back to Glasgow Heliport.This is baldly put and stood out as unfair to the families who had heard evidence lead which gave reasons why Captain Traill might not have checked the switches and why he might not have responded as per the Pilots Checklist in response to low fuel warnings.Captain Traill was wrong to ignore the five low fuel warnings that sounded during the final flight but the court heard clear reasons - relating to issues with fuel sensors in the EC helicopter - why he might logically have ignored them.A less highlighted fact, and one important to mention, is that Sherf Turnbull also found that had Airbus included an aural attention-getter that sounded when both fuel transfer pumps were switched off, the crash might have been avoided.So, disappointment for the families with regards to blaming Captain Traill and not anyone further up the chain.Disappointment too at feeling removed from the process of the inquiry which they waited six years to attend.On behalf of Mary Kavanagh, the partner of victim Robert Jenkins, QC Donald Findlay said that those who died and their families had \"merited scarcely a mention\". It was a sentiment repeated by those loved ones who turned up day after day to the inquiry and sat, dignied, through what must have been evidence traumatic for them to hear.Some wanted questions put to the emergency services who had attended the victims. \"No evidence has been led to show what more,anything, could have been done to save them,\" Mr Findlay again. \"It is submitted that this is what people would wish to know and are entitled to know.\"Of course families wanted clear answers to their questions but, without a black box recorder in the helicopter, any answers were only ever going to be hypotheses. The sherf, too, cannot be solely motivated by pleasing the victims and relatives when conducting a fatal accident inquiry. That is not his role.For those intimately involved it is impossible to separate emotions from proceedings and emotions do not always guide us well.However, it has been acknowledged by James Wolffe, the Lord Advocate, that the FAI system must better involve the bereaved and survivors with improved information sharing. He had pledged additional funding to achieve this, and to speed up a system whereby y delays can further traumatise victims.Sherf Turnbull, in his Clutha conclusions, also highlight the issue of the impact delays have on those involved.The families of those who died in the Clutha accident are not satisfied with the outcome of this inquiry but they will perhaps be satisfied with these acknowledgements.One certainty, at the end of six years, is that the families involved deserve praise for the dignity with which they conducted themselves throughout. Those at the top must match them in a resolve to speed up and improve the system."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2020-nationals-rally-independence---everything-need-know","story":"The event marks the first time that the paper has arranged a rally.

It is clear that these people were exploited by criminals with no care for their welfare ndash or even whether they lived or died. This devastating case brings home the brutal cost of human trafficking and exploitation.Yet we must never make the mistake of thinking that human trafficking is an unusual or uncommon crime, or one that would never happen in Scotland. In fact, there have been cases of human trafficking reported in every single one of Scotlandrsquos  local authorities. From our cities to our villages, no community in Scotland is untouched by trafficking.Worryingly, the statistics show that reports of human trafficking are growing. These victims are among the most vulnerable people in our society. They suffer the most appalling abuse of their human rights, forced to live and work in terrible conditions and under constant physical and psychological abuse. Across all the categories, the numbers in Scotland are increasing: children and adults male and female labour exploitation and sexual exploitation UK nationals and migrants.And those are only the cases we know about. Human trafficking and exploitation are hidden crimes, taking place under our noses but unrecognised.:Human trafficking action partnership at Glasgow Airport suspended lsquodue to BrexitrsquoAll over Scotland, there are women forced into sexual exploitation, coerced into prostitution by traffickers who exploit their vulnerability and lack of English language skills.

And children are trafficked by organised criminals to work in the ldquocounty lines drugs trade.Scotlandrsquos councils are working to improve how we identy and help the victims of trafficking. As the sphere of government closest to our communities, local authorities play a key role in responding to human trafficking across the country. In Scotland, the local government workforce is over , strong ndash our social workers, licensing officers, refuse collectors and housing officers are all well-placed to spot the signs that someone has been trafficked, alert the authorities and provide support. We owe it to the survivors of trafficking to improve how we do this.That is why last week Cosla, the membership body for Scotlandrsquos councils, launched guidance aimed at the local authority workforce, giving them information on how to spot the signs of human trafficking and what to dothey suspect it is taking place. Councils are advised to have proper processes in place to ensure frontline staff receive the training to spot any signs of human trafficking they might witness in the course of their day-to-day duties. Every council is advised to have strategies and effective plans for what to do when they encounter victims and to provide the critical support and refuge that a survivor needs.:Ian McConnell: East Renfrewshire Tory MP ignores Brexit economics to point at SNPWe also need to make sure we share all relevant information with the police, to ensure that they can arrest the perpetrators and disrupt the trafficking networks.The NHS has launched similar guidance for health workers and our colleagues in Police Scotland, the Scottish Government and the third sector are working to improve their response to human trafficking too.There is also a role for members of the public.

If unsure, it is always right to call  rather than not report at all. Human trafficking is a hidden crime, which means that the outside signs can be hard to spot. The more information the authorities have, the better the response.It can be hard to spot the victims of trafficking. Victims can be threatened with physical violence to themselves or their families, and they can be psychologically controlled and isolated, making them reluctant to speak out. Sometimes, victims donrsquot always recognise that they are victims, particularlythey see their current situation as an improvement.This can be the case, for example, for an orphaned street child living in extreme poverty, who is offered food and shelter in exchange for cleaning, cooking and looking after children in a family home, and who may see this as better than living on the streets at risk of greater exploitation. We all have a role to play in reporting suspicions of human trafficking, to free people from this exploitation.The terrible case last week in Essex underlines so tragically the importance of working to fight trafficking. We hope the perpetrators of this awful crime are brought to justice swtly. But we must never assume such crimes could not happen here. They do. For the victims in Scotland, we must do all we can to fight back against human trafficking and exploitation.Councillor Alison Evison is the COSLA President and CouncillorKelly Parry is the COSLA spokesperson for Community Wellbeing"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-only-listening-corbyn-not-voters-claim-tories","story":"The party said the SNP and Labour leaders were ldquoalready having private chats with an eye to him granting Indyref infor her propping up a minority Labour government.Acting Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw made the accusations as he campaigned in Aberdeen and unveiled a new poster depicting Ms Sturgeon with her fingers in her ears.:Nicola Sturgeon says Labour will grant Indyref\"She still wont listen, so tell her again,\" it says.Mr Carlaw said the SNP had lost  seats and almost half a million votes at the  general election after trying to make Brexit a ldquospringboard to Indyref.He said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon is not listening ndash she is obsessed with independence and we must send her a message at this general election.ldquoPeople have had enough of the ision and we just want to move on.ldquoHere in the north-east of Scotland, voters overwhelmingly rejected independence in .ldquoYet, here we are in  and the entire SNP campaign is based on a re-run of that decisive vote.

He identied some of the capitalist criminals Labour is coming for, including Sir Jim Ratclfe of Ineos. Though its not clear under what law the polluting plutocrats could be prosecuted.So, is this class war in the UK  Are we on the road to Venezuela  Whatever the polls say, a Labour victory this Christmas is quite possible with Nigel Farages Brexit Party now splitting the Tory vote. There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Atlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labours policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a le-long member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Mr Corbyn will still enter Number Ten with a raft of left wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich till the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools, and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axing tax reliefs worth about pound.billionSimilarly, seizing ten percent of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by share-holders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labours policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed form Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, child care for  and  year olds, scrapping the right-to-buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax - these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnt be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labours Green New Deal. A majority of voters agree there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thats only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution. Labours policy would mean decarbonising transport, home heating and agriculture in a decade. Millions of cars would have to be scrapped along with millions of home heating boilers. Air travel would all but cease.Labour promises a huge investment in renewable industries, to compensate, but that is unlikely to replace the jobs lost in the car industry, oil and gas, road haulage, retail.So expect the Green New Deal to become somewhat lighter green in government. There is likely to be a rt between the Thunberg-supporting ldquode-growthers and Labour MPs, who traditionally see economic growth as the best way to address poverty and inequality.However, Britain already has a rather good record on eliminating greenhouse emissions, and this will continue, albeit with the  taget reduced to % net zero. In sum, Labour offers a practical social democratic programme which could be very attractive to voters, especially younger ones. However there is one very big problem: Brexit.Labour is committed to negotiating a new Withdrawal Deal to replace Boris Johnsonsand to putting this to another Brexit referendum. This will consume a vast amount of political capital and will surely dominate the first year of a Labour government.Mr Corbyn wants to reintroduce the Customs Union, and Brussels would probably agree to that. But Labour also want close regulatory alignment with the European Single Market, which the EU  would probably reject. If Britain wants to be in the single market, it will have to join the single market, probably via the European Economic Area, along with Norway.Labour could go along with that in the end, since it wants friction-free access to the EU markets. Single market membership would solve the Irish border problem, for sure. But it would also mean Britain continuing to contribute to the EU Budget, while having no say over decisions taken by Brussels. Customs Union membership requires oversight by the European Court of Justice, which will displease many.But that wouldnt be the main problem. If Labour got this wonderful deal, including workers rights and environmental standards, and got it through parliament , would it really then campaign against it in the confirmatory referendum Interviewers have largely stopped asking this question, because they never get an answer, but Europe remains a huge question mark hanging over Labours government agenda.Labour is still a Brexit party, though you wouldnt know to listen to most MPs. Many figures in the party are closet Brexiteers, like Jeremy Corbyn himself. Others are openly pro-Brexit, like the party chairman Ian Lavery and the MPs who voted for Boris Johnsons Deal.Equally dedicated Remainers ndash mostly Blairites and supporters of the deputy leader Tom Watson ndash would fight back, insisting that Labour effectively promised to back Remain in the general election. Brexit wrangling could delay the confirmatory referendum and ide the party, just as it split the Tories.Corbyns enemies will ignite further ision by condemning him as antisemitic. It will take immense powers of leadership to prevent a Labour government being halted in its radical tracks by Brexit. The question for voters is: does Jeremy Corbyn posses it "},{"url":null,"title":"birds put on a show at forvie reserve","story":"Photographers have captured stunning images of wild geese and waders flocking to a local nature reserve.Images taken at Scottish Natural Heritagenational nature reserve at Forvie reveal the mass migration of wild birds from Iceland, Greenland and Svalbard.Stuart MacQuarrie, SNH’s Head of Nature Reserves, said: “To see a flock of geese as they lt off from their night-time roost is one of Scotland’s greatest wildle spectacles.

In Orkney, Police have joined up with Orkney Road Safety forum, to encourage cyclists to remain safe and visible, with not only education, but the handing out of bike lights.Police are reminding cyclists that along with obeying all traffic signs, traffic light signals and not cycling on pavements, they must equip their bikes with the appropriate lights and make sure they are lit when it starts to get dark.Officers in Orkney will be proactively looking to address cyclists who ignore the legislative requirement to illuminate their bikes in darkness, and will be providing bike lights to those who need them. Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ruling on Huaweirsquos participation in UK G had already been delayed from July after the Government said it was not in a position to make a final decision because of uncertainty created by the US Government placing trade restrictions on the firm over security fears.Major network operators have already begun rolling out their G networks across parts of the UK.Mr Tugendhat said: ldquoThe Foreign Affairs Committee has been investigating the way the autocratic states intervene in democracies.ldquoMany members have been concerned about the Chinese technological dominance, nowhere more than in the G market.ldquoI wrote to the DCMSSecretary to ensure that no decision would be made in the tail end of the Government.ldquoIrsquom pleased to hear that a decision that could nest a hostile statersquos technology deep in the central nervous system of the UK communications network will be taken by a new administration after a full debate.ldquoThis decision has major foreign policy implications as it calls into question our most important security partnership, the Five-Eyes Alliance, and our economic relationship with other nations around the world including Australia, Canada and the United States.copy -.

It is made therefore by the BBCrsquos in-house news department.ldquoPoints Of View is a non-news entertainment programme which ranges across every TV genre that the BBC makes.ldquoThere is a clear distinction between the two shows, and their genres, which is reflected in their broadcasting slot and their audience.Mr Rangarajan said one key dference between news and non-news shows was presenter appeal.He told the  that the personalities of the presenters did not greatly impact the appeal of news programmes such as Newswatch, but had a role in non-news programmes including Points Of View.ldquoWhen people turn onto the news, they turn on to see the news that day, he said.ldquoHowever,you have a dferent presenter for a non-news show, the audience will go up or down and the appreciation they have can be seen.Mr Rangarajan, who has been director of strategy for the broadcaster since , said Ahmed and Vine ldquoperform very dferent roles in the corporation.ldquoNewswatch requires a trained, experienced journalist able to ask dficult questions of senior executives where necessary, he said.He added: ldquoThe public profile of presenters is signicant in a non-news context and is more important than in news.ldquoProfile is one of the ious inidual factors in news presenter pay, but it is not dominant.ldquoThe most high-profile presenters can become channel-defining for broadcasters.He went on to say that Newswatch is less newsworthy than other news and factual programming by the BBC, measured by how often the shows were mentioned in the press.Mr Rangarajan added: ldquoThe Today Programme has around ,, BBC Breakfast has around , and Newswatch has .He later referenced the average audience figures of , with , adults watching per week for Newswatch and , per week for Points Of View.Showing the tribunal  a graph of viewing figures by time, the tribunal heard there were ldquodips in viewing including shortly after Newswatch began.ldquoThe dip happens one or two minutes or so in the case of Newswatch. The programme begins at : and the dip occurs at :, Mr Rangarajan said.The pay for on-air roles is determined by the long-term impact they have on the BBCrsquos audience and its core editorial impact, known as Band F positions.Mr Rangarajan said Newswatch and Ahmed did not meet the Band F criteria, and was instead at the top of Band E when assessed.Rachel Crasnow, QC, representing the BBC, previously said Newswatch was broadcast on the ldquorelatively niche BBC News channel.However Claire Darwin, representing Ahmed, highlighted the wider reach of Newswatch and the BBC News channel.She said: ldquoThe news channel reaches about % of the UK population for at least three minutes a week, so about eight or nine million people. So itrsquos not really that niche.She also added that the average audience figure has remained stable over the past seven years, despite general television viewing figures falling among all broadcasters.ldquoIf your audience figures for a programme stay the same from  to , yoursquore doing quite well, Ms Darwin added.The tribunal continues.copy -.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-BACK-CHOIR-4.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":null,"title":"exceptional period residence","story":"#Prospect House# is an exceptional period residence occupying a choice mature setting yet is within a short walk to the town centre and facilities of Ballymoney.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38648579.ece/3f117/BINARY/Sundae.jpg","title":"mcdonalds in portugal apologises for halloween social media campaign","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Terry Wright, former Vice Chair of the UUP that unionism must jettison treating Brexit solely as a constitutional watershed and move towards a transformed Northern Ireland.  Since government determined solely by a headcount Unionist majority in Northern Ireland proved unsustainable, Unionism has faced a number of internal crises resulting from actions by Westminster governments. Deemed unpalatable and unacceptable, many of these have been met, not with creative strategies but with protest, strident but ineffective pseudo-sectarian - posturing and, on the basis of where unionism stands today, flawed decision-making resulting from deceptive election results and occasionally favourable arithmetic in the House of Commons. googletag.cmd.push Content to agonise rather than organise, Unionism has travelled unerringly down the road of its own failings to become a danger to the Union. It seems that Brexit could soon claim a place as yet another milestone. Whilst the Brexit process, even after three years and more, remains in limbo, with Parliament still to sign off a final Withdrawal Agreement, No Deal, People’s Vote or General Election before detailed trade negotiations can begin, political Unionism is not well-placed. Characterised by disarranged and expedient strategic thinking, it seems ill equipped for relevant political discourse even with the broader pro-Union constituency, many of whom see a need to re-evaluate long held positions. Unionism has moved beyond an age of careless and stereotypical single labels. Within the pro-Union constituency identities are hyphenated and erse. Some identy as pro-Union, economic-unionist, civic-unionist, liberal-unionist and cultural-unionist or a fluid combination of two or more to ying degrees. A large proportion voted to remain in the EU and, in an increasingly personalised society, have no major issues with the delivery of marriage equality, the de-criminalisation of abortion and the provision of choice within ethical parameters. They also see a need to reach accommodation and exercise perspective without bias on rights, cultural and language issues which currently serve as a forum for mutually exclusive combat between the two major parties. In pursuit of their Brexit strategies, the unionist parties, mainly the DUP, instead of engaging in the modern issue-centred discourse which the debate requires, have been content to wrongly categorise Brexit as mainly a constitutional issue and rely on the de-sensitisation of its constituency to the blurred truth, spin and inaccuracies promoted by the Leave campaign. In an act of collective self-deception, it took a reckless gamble with the future and has served to produce the opposite of what it claimed to prioritise with ergence from the remainder of the United Kingdom, a situation which is not itself unusual for the DUP and other Unionists. It grasped an opportunity to wring money from Westminster and allied itself closely to a questionably optimistic pro-Brexit  but in so doing, failed to address the broader ramications of what Brexit could mean for Northern Ireland, socially, culturally and crucially, in terms of reconciliation and stability. It ignored not just the large and erse Remain vote but Unionists, already disenchanted by lack of movement on social issues and concerned by economic and political uncertainty. Had it explored the possibilities within the Good Friday Agreement structures which it now so vigorously defends and embraced the North-South Bodies more energetically, a process might have produced an internalised all-island solution with EU endorsement which facilitated preferred aspirations. Notably, the Ulster Unionist Party moved belatedly toward this position. Now, presented by proposals it does not like, yet facilitated through its tactics, the main party of unionism seems likely to adopt the default position of retrenchment to a place of fear and resistance. Abandoned by erstwhile friends in Westminster who are the epitome of political insincerity and who, seeing Northern Ireland as a handicap to Brexit, have made their priorities clear, this seems a forlorn hope likely to add to the current sadness of spirit within unionism flowing from the trickle-down dys of the DUP leadership. The DUP engaged in a mutually commodied accommodation more to do with opportunism than leadership and the outcome could be predicted. Communal conflict has remained in the minds of too many of its political leaders and this, allied to narrow defensive and cultural politics has led unionism, already discredited by expense scandals which lay bare the moral and pampered relativism of unionist politicians, into a cul-de-sac. As many voters, no longer prepared to be associated with political mediocrity abandon the toxic terminology and one agenda politics of unionist to opt for a pro-Union identity, political unionism needs a re-boot. Those who wish to lead could begin with a robust analysis of the turmoil and abandon the self-deception that Northern Ireland is a place where the will of a unionist majority can always prevail. Unionism is living in the long shadow of Home Rule where diminishing support at Westminster with demographic and changing generational profiles in Northern Ireland indicate that the maintenance of a pro-Union position is no longer guaranteed on the basis of a communal headcount and rests on persuasion for a preferred future. A post-Brexit world that will present challenges is unpredictable, but unionism must look for opportunities that may also present to re-generate. Too often it has lacked an ear for the wrong notes. The Brexit deal which Boris Johnston has brought back from Brussels with its proposals for Northern Ireland bears all the hallmarks of effective lobbying by a business sector, supported by Remain parties, anxious to protect trade and explore opportunities for growth but the obvious uncertainty and confusion of Ministers indicates cause for concern and that all the boxes are not yet ticked that Northern Ireland could be worse off than at present. The clumsy manner in which the values and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement are appearing to be compromised and thrown over by Westminster only serves to tighten the knots. To meet the challenges, Unionism needs to inject stability and focus on a shared future to address the developing situation and build a consensus to solve potential problems across and within regulatory and alignment areas. Livelihoods and public services depend on this being resolved. Now is the time for problem-solving coalitions to build an Agreed Northern Ireland. It will not be achieved by tokenistic changes of label from traditional to expedient grandstanding on second-hand radical liberalismyou still enable sectarianism, segregation and prejudice. The values and attitudes which inform actions are how unionism will be measured and it is presently found wanting by large swathes of its constituency. Substance will always be more important than style and it is the only ethical basis on which you can create the conditions for the realisation of political ideas. Late in the day, Unionism can benefit by sharing responsibility for creating a transformed Northern Ireland and abandoning any desire to dominate the old. Brexit seems to be consigning the dying embers of that particular flame to the dustbin.

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty Gallagher with friend Barry Smith after London marathon No closure Martin and Elizabeth were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

Two days later, two further sinkholes appeared, and a huge split broke the pitch in half and spread to the clubhouse and car park. The grounds were immediately shut down, and the misery was compounded a few weeks later when the club were relegated from senior football for the first time in  years.This season they have made use of alternate venues as the work continues to re-establish their own home, with a GoFundMe page raising tens of thousands towards the project. The club – who have appeared in six of the last  Monaghan Senior Club Championship finals, with the most recent appearance in  – have secured their position back in the senior ranks for next season, but first they must deal with the business of Ulster.For Foreglen, it’s a familiar position. At the start of the Derry championship they were ranked as dark horses, but were few people’s out and out favourites. Bar a first round replay against Faughanvale they barely faltered on the way to the showpiece, but still there were few in their corner against Claudy. It mattered little as they held the Mitchel’s to one score – a free – in the second half to claim a - to - win. O’Brien’s coach Muldoon believes they can take serious confidence not just from the result, but from the nature of the performance.“I think after the replay with Faughanvale, as the championship went on our confidence just got better and better and we’re going into this game now off the back of a big performance,” the Ballinderry man told the Derry Post. “My team talks are very brief before a game because we do the work in training. The boys know on the day what they have to do, who they’re marking, what the plan is for kick outs – it’s all organised.“We’ll sit down this week and look at Magheracloone. There’s not a lot of information or videos out there but we’ll get our planning done and be ready for the challenge. It will probably be a case of giving it five or ten minutes and then making the switches that we need to.“It’s bonus territory for us, and it’s unknown territory too. We know they’re going to be a very good, strong side and we’re expecting a tough challenge but it’s one that we’re all looking forward to.”From the scenes on the pitch in Celtic Park after their victory two weeks ago to the social media posts from Foreglen clubhouse in the following days, the togetherness of the whole community has come to the fore. Even as a man not from the club, Muldoon said it was something special, and something they’d like to repay. “After the final whistle I stood back and saw my two boys running onto the pitch in their Foreglen tops and I shed a tear. They’re a small parish, and I know a lot of them are the same, but in that clubhouse on the Sunday night, I’d never seen a crowd like it. “We said to the lads last week that when it came to Ulster there was a choice to train a few times or put the heads down and give it a rattle. We want to set an example for the county and to be fair they’ve put the shoulder to the wheel for their community.“It’s a day out for everyone to jump on a bus together and head down. Who knows what’s going to happen, but we’ll all be sticking together as a team and with the supporters and we’ll give it everything for them.” googletag.cmd.push FORGET ODDSDespite all their dficulties last year, Magheracloone still managed to reach the senior championship semi-final, defeated by eventual title winners Scotstown. The enormity of the task at hand isn’t lost on Muldoon, but he insisted that the underdog tag hasn’t been an issue for his men so far – they’re relishing it.“We’ve been happy enough to take the underdogs tag. Before the Claudy game there were a lot of people who thought we had no chance, but we didn’t care,” he insisted. “The boys all got it out of their heads and we focused on ourselves.“To be fair, Claudy were rightly favourites because they were head and shoulders above anyone in the league, but we knew what we were about and we knew what we were doing. The whole favourites thing is all part of the build-up, but we won’t read too much into it this time either.”Both played five championship matches on their way to their provincial titles, with the Monaghan side both scoringand concedingmore than Foreglen, who scored - and conceded -. Even with county level players like Gavin Doogan and Tomas Freeman on the other side, Muldoon reiterated his faith in the O’Brien’s defence, and he feels the forward line can take confidence knowing that they will get opportunities.“In training and in all our games we have the same set up – it’s man to man marking, no sweepers and no hiding places, and we’ve no plans to change that,” explained the coach. “In the build-up to the final nobody was giving our defence any credit, it was all about the Claudy forwards, and vice versa about our attack.“Our defence is tight, the boys talk to one another, you have the likes of Oisin and Shane Duffy in there and they’re all told what to be doing before the game. Them boys don’t have the cover of a sweeper, but they do their job, they back themselves against their man and they have confidence as a unit.”For the seasoned professionals like Oisin Duffy, Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor, the pressure of an Ulster quarter-final won’t weigh too heavy on the shoulders, but Muldoon said he is particularly delighted that the younger squad members, like Liam O’Hara, Sean, Cahir and Caolan O’Connor, have all shown that they can handle the mental pressure of the big occasion. It’s a quality he feels will stand them in good stead come Sunday afternoon.“I sat down on the Saturday night before the game with Claudy and rang some of them young lads and said to them that I knew what they were feeling, and they’d got us there through talent and enthusiasm. They worked hard all year in the gym, but they had to go out and treat it as any other game,” he explained. “In fairness to them they did, and I thought every one of them were immense. “Now getting the chance to play in Ulster – it’s a brilliant experience for them young cubs and it’s one that will definitely stand to them.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

Co. Tyrone mumpreneurs - Joanne Gallagher and Stephanie Rice – launched Good Vibes in their home town of Strabane in June this year, after identying a gap in the market for alternative and holistic treatments in the town. Joanne said, “I felt the benefits of alternative and holistic treatments personally and wanted to know more, so after much research I trained to become a Meditation Coach, Reiki Master and NLP Practitioner. “I have always been passionate about wellness and in recent years have practised privately, offering holistic treatments such as reiki and meditation to clients who experience symptoms including anxiety, stress, aches and pains, among other things.“I feel passionately about the benefits of alternative therapy and since Stephanie, my best friend from secondary school also practised within the field, it just made sense for us to join forces.”Joanne and Stephanie offer a iety of alternative therapies, including reflexology, massage, meditation and yoga in a safe and friendly environment that allows clients to explore which practice works best for them. Joanne and Stephanie welcome a wide range of clients to their studio, from alternative therapy veterans to those who are new to holistic healing techniques. Stephanie, who is a reflexologist, Indian head masseuse and Aromatherapy Specialist and plans to train as a yoga teacher next Spring. Said: “Helping others is something I have always loved doing. I am passionate about alternative therapies and have experienced first-hand the effect these, combined with the power of positivity, can have. “Opening my own business was something I had always dreamed of and with Joanne also working within the industry, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for us to partner up to bring the dream to le. Joanne and Stephanie turned their idea for a business into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme, which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies.The Go For It Programme, provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn people’s ideas for a business into a commercial enterprise.Stephanie commented, “We had the passion for health and wellbeing, but beyond our qualications and training we didn’t know how to put it all together into a sustainable business model. That’s where the Go For It Programme came in and really helped us. “The programme helped us with everything from marketing strategies to financial planning. The Business Advisors were very attentive and explained everything to us in great detail, and we both felt really informed and supported throughout the whole process. With the help of the programme, we were really supported to set up the business.Orla McNulty, business adviser with Strabane Enterprise Agency on behalf of Derry City and Strabane District Council, said, “It was a pleasure to assist Joanne and Stephanie in the start-up stage of their business. They have a real passion for health and wellbeing and that passion for helping others really underpins their business ethos. ““I sat down with Joanne and Stephanie and together we planned a clear strategy for their business start-up. A business plan was developed with detailed financial forecasts, marketing strategies and addressed legal issues.”“I’m delighted to see that the business is thriving for the ladies, with so many people availing of the fantastic services they are now providing in Strabane town centre. With their passion for health and wellbeing, their vast experience in alternative therapies and their specialist qualications, Joanne and Stephanie are well positioned within the marketplace and have a bright future ahead of them.”If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It team on    or visit: www.goforitni. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

British Prime Minister Harold Wilsons oft-quoted aphorism proved true once again this week, with the EU granting Britain yet another Brextension.March  came and went, October  the same, then, on Monday past, British Prime Minister Boris Johnston accepted Friday, January , , as the day Britain would, maybe, finally leave the EU. Undeterred by the interminable political machinations, multi- disciplinary artist, Duncan McKellar, on Simdau ast staged his “Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders” fields adjacent to Killeas Church of the Immaculate Conception.Speaking before the event, Mr McKellar said he was “very happy” with the support from the gathering local communities. He had plotted out a -metre-wide circle in two fields taking in both sides of the border with participants standing beside little bamboo markers he had placed in the ground.“It is at the same time, a protest against hard borders and a celebration of the communities around the hard borders. “Hopefully, we will end up with some nice video from the drone and some nice photographs,” he said.Mr McKellar arrived in Killea  days before the “Giant Artwork” took place and said the local “engagement” had been “fantastic.”He said: “People are enthused by the novelty of the idea. There is a palpable warmth. The Irish stereotype holds up very well.“I have been getting lots of help and lots of advice. People have been bending over backwards to help. Just this morning, Ive laid sawdust at the entrance of the field to cover up the mud and Miacuteċeaacutel, who runs the timber merchants, took it round on a truck and said, Anything I can do just let me know.”Introducing himself to the assembled crowd, Mr McKellar explained his work often used mirrors and often took place in border communities. He said: “Last year, I managed to organise a long line which stretched for  kilometre on each side of the US   Mexico border.“We also had a huge group of people on the White Clfs on March , the day Brexit was originally meant to happen. “We sent a giant SOS call to mainland Europe with our mirrors.“With the focus turning to the Northern Ireland border, I thought it was an appropriate time to come here. We are going to form a big circle, to symbolise the strength within the community here and also to show the strength of feeling against hard borders because obviously it used to be right there, the checkpoint.“We will walk to the brow of the hill. The border itself is the Liberty Burn at the bottom of the field. The sun will hit the mirrors and, as well as adding a bit of fairy dust to the images and drone footage, they symbolise the human spirit,” said Duncan.Patrick ODonnell who owns a garage in Killea said he got involved in Duncans Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders to support the artist.Patrick said: “I came along this morning to support Duncan and to protest against Brexit. The artistic aspect of the protest appealed to me.“The idea of hands across the border appealed to me. We dont want a hard border again, we dont want a border at all, basically.“As a business person, I think a hard border would be a disaster, a disaster totally,” said Patrick.The next thing Duncan has in the pipeline is maybe an installation in Palestine. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

would follow the lead by NHS England and make Cystic Fibrosisdrugs Orkbambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco available to eligible patients.It is hoped that their two year-old son, Lorcaacuten, and other CF sufferers will be offered the drugs within weeks.The initial cost of a yearrsquos supply of the drug was estimated at pound, per patient.Last night Jen told the Recorder that she and her husband were ldquoecstatic but the news still has sunk in after they were called to a meeting with Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly at Stormont.The surprise announcement came as the couple were preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

believes that Lorcaacuten will be on the drug before Christmas and recognises this as a gt of le.ldquoItrsquos not that this is just a good Christmas present but that we have actually been given extra Christmases with our son, said Jen.ldquoOne of the models for the drugs suggest thatyou start it at age six, you can have an extra  years on top of the normal le expectancy for a CF sufferer. ldquoItrsquos like we have been given  Christmases with Lorcaacuten, that it what it really means to us.Lorcaacuten currently needs two sessions of physio each day and uses a nebuliser five times a day along with  tables to absorb fat from his food.He has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last Christmas.Jen said: ldquoHopefully, by taking the drugs, it will mean that will be the end of the infection and he wonrsquot get other infections.ldquoIt gives us even more time to keep him healthy until the better drugs come along.The  year-old has been one of the most vocerous

true for singer Mark McMullan, who has just landed himself the lead role in a major touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Mark will follow in the footsteps of Jason Donovan and Philip Schofield who played Joseph when he takes to the stage in Doncaster for a five-month tour from December .The role is Markrsquos first major performance in a national stage musical and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars

Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager. I speak every night to my Mum and him and he wants to know everything.Mark will continue with his job as architect while living in Newcastle-upon-Tyne with his partner, Zoe Hunter, who he met while they were students at Down High, until he feels confident that a secure future lies ahead of him in musical theatre.ldquoIrsquom also doing a Masters degree in architecture so between work, studying and rehearsal, le is very busy at the moment, he added.Bill Kenwrightrsquos production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webberrsquos musical will play in Doncaster from December  to January  before continuing its UK tour in Peterborough, Aylesbury, Wimbledon, Coventry, Bradford, Chesterfield and Sunderland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting on bypass plans  ","story":"ROADS issues topped the agenda during a meeting in Downpatrick last week including progress on the multi-million pound Ballynahinch bypass scheme.South Down MP Chris Hazzard led a Sinn Fein delegation which met with senior Department of Infrastructure officials at Rathkeltair House.The MP was joined by South Down MLAs Emma Rogan and Sinead Ennis and councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Cathy Mason and Willie Clarke.Mr Hazzard said roads officials provided the delegation with a detailed overview of the local situation, including the impact of successive government austerity budgets on the departmentrsquos ability to maintain the network, invest in much-needed new public transport infrastructure and deliver the appropriate winter service in the months ahead.The MP said that despite the dficult operational environment, it was pleasing to hear that the roads department is continuing to deliver much-needed improvements, including progressing with the final legal stages of the Ballynahinch bypass.It was also confirmed that work is continuing on congestion alleviation schemes in Downpatrick and much-needed road safety enhancements in Mayobridge.ldquoWe also discussed the imminent public inquiry of the vitally important A junctions scheme, perhaps the highest priority local roads scheme given the huge road safety advantages that scheme is likely to deliver and the Newry southern relief road, said the MP.ldquoI was also pleased to hear roads officials speak passionately about delivering a number of park and ride facilities that will help meet the growing demand for modern, fit-for-purpose public transport options in the local area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Niall.jpg","title":"Niall backs start up loans plan  ","story":"THE founder of a Castlewellan business which makes an intelligent outdoor storage solution has been chosen to champion UK start-ups by the government-backed Start-Up Loans programme.Niall Greenan from The Smart Bunker was one of  business founders honoured at a reception at Westminster last week to celebrate some of the UKrsquos most successful small businesses.The Smart Bunker is an easy-to-use dispensing system which releases coal with a simple pull of a lever to fill the bucket to the required amount that can be carried.Mr Greenan , came up with the idea when he realised how dficult it was for his mother, who has arthritis, to fill a coal bucket from her traditional coal bin.He used a pound, Start-Up Loan to develop the device, which has gone on to win several awards.Mr Greenan has also expanded The Smart Bunker to include safe storage of wood pellets, ice treatment and animal feed.The product has attracted attention for its sustainability credentials, providing a good alternative to the plastic bags usually usedfor agricultural storage.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Atlantic Sessions will kick off on November  with a special event to commemorate the remarkable collection of Coleraine native Sam Henry, who was born in .Sam Henry, who was born in Coleraine in Carolyn Mathers of organisers Snow Water said: “What we’ve done at the recent festivals is open up by celebrating the area’s musical heritage.

It will be followed by a QA with the producer and live performances.Across the four day festival audiences will have the chance to hear Northern Ireland’s finest talent, including over  of the  Music Prize nominees, in unique, intimate venues. New locations have been added this year such as the Causeway Lass Boat, Holy Trinity Parish, Star of the Sea Chapel, as well as favourites such as the Arcadia, Yacht Club, Harry’s Shack on the beach, the Anchor and Atlantic.Discussing the success of the festival, Carolyn said: “Causeway Coast and Glens Council set it up over  years ago to bring people to the area when it was out of season. Like any coastal resort it’s so busy during the summer but there’s a couple of dark months coming up to Christmas when there’s nothing happening.. The book was launched by Mary McAleese .

The party has shrunken considerably in North Belfast over the last decade. Robert Foster, an Antrim and Newtownabbey councillor, was the UUP candidate in the  assembly election, the last time the party contested North Belfast in an election. Last night he told the News Letter he had no ambition to be candidate this time, citing his business and council work.Another potential candidate, Mark Cosgrove, the UUP’s treasurer and the party’s group leader on Antrim and Newtownabbey Council, said that due to business commitments and his council work he did not want to be a full-time politician.Yesterday the Belfastpublished a letter signed by  north Belfast unionists who called on Mr Aiken not to contest the constituency. One of those who signed the letter, Dean McCullough, was described as chair of Rathcoole Neighbourhood Renewal. It did not mention that Mr McCullough is also a DUP councillor, and therefore might be expected to endorse the party policy of allowing Mr Dodds a free run.When asked about that, Mr McCullough told the News Letter that his DUP political role was not mentioned in the letter because he had signed it in his community capacity.The letter was signed by other unionists from ious backgrounds, including PUP leader Billy Hutchinson and Belfast County Grand Master of the Orange Order, Spencer Beattie.NI people offended as McDonalds Portugal apologises over Sundae Bloody Sundae Halloween advertising campaign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was also signed by a sitting UUP councillor, Frazer Agnew, and someone who was a UUP councillor until May,Davy Browne.The letter set out “strong opposition” to the policy espoused by Mr Aiken, arguing that the “only consequence” of challenging Mr Dodds would be to help Sinn Fein.The letter, which was restrained in tone, said: “The North Belfast seat holds a special place in the heart of the unionist community across Northern Ireland. The seat once held by Edward Carson, since its creation, North Belfast has always ed a unionist Member of Parliament.“For decades the unionist community in North Belfast faced the brunt of the sectarian murder campaign of the IRA. It was the collective unwavering resolve and unity of purpose amongst our community that gave us the strength to carry on. It is that sense of unity and standing together that continues to define the unionist community in North Belfast to this day.“Whilst we the undersigned come from dferent political viewpoints, as unionists, we are all united in our desire to ensure North Belfast s a unionist Member of Parliament.”It went on: “Nigel Dodds has been the collective choice of our united unionist community in North Belfast.“The only consequence of running a candidate against Nigel will be to help Sinn Fein. Only Nigel can retain this seat.”When asked for Mr Aiken’s response to the letter, the UUP responded with a brief statement from a party spokesman.The statement did not state unambiguously – as Mr Aiken did earlier this week – that the party will unquestionably be standing in North Belfast.Instead, it simply said: “The letter has been received and we are listening respectfully to all views in the community.”The last time the UUP stood in North Belfast constituency was the  assembly election the party took , votes. In the  general election, even with the UUP standing aside, Sinn Fein was just , votes behind Mr Dodds.l Morning View, page ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- Traffic and Travel   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Traffic and Travel      .\"  Larne Bus Station upgrade worksUpgrade work is scheduled to get underway on Monday, November , at Larne Bus Station.

There was no power or water so we had to boil water at home for tea and coffee.ldquoThe new one has a sink, microwave and wersquore getting a fridge.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
