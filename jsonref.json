Ms Foster wanted to wait and see what legal advice would be given about the new Backstop proposals before deciding whether to back it or notThe Northern Irish party  said it cannot see how its members can back the prime minister\u0027s Brexit deal in a vote today, according to the Financial Times.When a DUP source was asked if they could see the party supporting the PM\u0027s deal in the Commons tonight after reading Geoffrey Cox\u0027s legal advice, they said no, the paper reported. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said in Parliament after the statement was delivered: \u0027We know already from the Irish government and others what they see as the ultimate destination for Northern Ireland - the backstop is the bottom line.\u0027From what the Attorney General is saying today, provided there is no bad faith, the fact is that Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom could be trapped if it\u0027s a question that the EU does not agree with the United Kingdom to a superseding agreement.\u0027On the Continental, Jean-Claude Juncker appeared to make a sex joke about Theresa May when speaking in the European parliament in Strasbourg today.Corbyn blasts May\u0027s \u0027failed\u0027 Brexit negotiations and vows to...Bullied by customs thugs under the pretence of Brexit:...May returns to Downing Street after winning \u0027legally binding...Share this articleAccording to reporters he said: \u0027Allow me to tell you a secret. I didn\u0027t sleep much last night because of Mrs May...but long enough to be able to dream of Slovakia and Bratislava.\u0027Mr Juncker tweeted after the proposal was announced yesterday, that was retweeted by chief negotiator Michel Barnier, saying British MPs had a choice between either Mrs May\u0027s deal or possibly no Brexit at all. He wrote: \u0027Our agreement provides meaningful clarifications \u0026amp legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement \u0026amp #backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal, or #Brexit may not happen at all. Let\u0027s bring the UK\u0027s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.\u0027           Leo Varadkar urged British MPs earlier today to lift the \u0027dark cloud\u0027 of the withdrawal process and back the new \u0027legally binding\u0027 documents Mrs May secured last night           Theresa May leaving from Downing Street ahead of a crucial Parliamentary vote on her deal for the country\u0027s withdrawal from the EUGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said today that the European Union made \u0027clear, far-reaching proposals\u0027 to address Britain\u0027s concerns about its withdrawal deal.Merkel said at a brief news conference in Berlin with visiting Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel that \u0027today is an important day\u0027 and she will watch closely what happens in Britain this week. She stressed \u0027we want an orderly British withdrawal\u0027 and that \u0027we made an effort to address British sensitivities, British wishes and British concerns\u0027.In a series of tweets this morning Leo Varadkar said the legal guarantees given by the EU provided and \u0027additional layer of clarification\u0027.He wrote: \u0027The documents published by the EU and UK last night are complementary to the Withdrawal Agreement \u0026amp Political Declaration \u0026amp provide an additional layer of interpretation, clarification and elaboration to the UK.\u0027However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer further guarantees \u0026amp reassurances to the UK of our good faith \u0026amp intentions. The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing \u0026amp represents an unambiguous statement of what has been agreed.\u0027Withdrawal Agreement represents a fair compromise by all sides.\u0027Mr Varadkar was due to fly to the US on Monday evening for his annual St Patrick\u0027s celebration trip, but his plans were changed at the last minute to accommodate Monday\u0027s unscheduled cabinet meeting.The Taoiseach said: \u0027The instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed.\u0027It does not reopen the withdrawal agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application.          Mr Juncker said British MPs had a choice between either Mrs May\u0027s deal or possibly no Brexit at all. He is pictured speaking during a plenary session at the European Parliament today\u0027It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the protocol (backstop), particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met.\u0027Luxembourg\u0027s finance minister, Pierre Gramegna said EU has \u0027gone the extra mile\u0027 with its Brexit reassurances.He told Bloomberg: \u0027Given the reassurances the United Kingdom is asking for, I think on the European side we have done everything that we can. I hope this extra effort from both sides will pay off.\u0027Mr Varadkar said the Irish Government was committed to exploring alternatives to the insurance policy in a timely way, in the event that the overall future relationship cannot be concluded in a satisfactory and timely manner.He warned: \u0027But it does not call into question that the backstop will apply unless and until better arrangements are agreed, with all parties using good faith and best endeavours to that aim.\u0027He said the newly-agreed texts recalled the dispute resolution mechanisms in the Withdrawal Agreement that could be invoked were either party to demonstrate bad faith, including the possibility of seeking a ruling from a panel of arbitrators.\u0027I hope that, together with the joint statement on the political declaration, it will provide a basis on which we can move forward again.\u0027Mr Varadkar said the threat of the UK leaving the EU with no deal had been a dark cloud for many months.\u0027A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the EU.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/12/00/06C8DDFE000007D0-0-image-a-1_1552349349487.jpg","title":"PETER OBORNE stakes not higher MPs prepare fateful vote history","story":"    \u0027At lunchtime yesterday Theresa May (pictured) looked finished. Negotiations with Brussels had failed. It appeared that Britain’s last days in the European Union had turned into a fiasco, and the Prime Minister’s heroic three-year quest to deliver Brexit was doomed\u0027This last-minute dash meant only one thing. The Prime Minister smelt a deal in the offing. One that could help her muster enough support in the House of Commons.But is she right?Has Mrs May extracted enough from Brussels to satisfy the 118 Tory Brexiteers who voted down her deal in January – in the process inflicting the largest defeat on a sitting prime minister in living memory?We won’t know the answer to that question till later today, but the problem is simple to explain. Mrs May cannot hope to get the support of Tory rebels if her withdrawal arrangement leaves Britain stuck forever in the Irish backstop – meaning that Northern Ireland must stay in the customs union, subject to European rules but with no decision making capacity.Brexiteers say that such an arrangement turns Britain into a ‘vassal state’. Not in a million years will they vote for it.However, if Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of Commons.Last night the Government and Brussels agreed a plan that could enable Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to alter his legal advice on the backstop.The package includes a new legally-binding document that should allow the UK to seek an exit from the backstop if the EU tries to make it permanent, along with legal status for a separate package of assurances offered by Brussels in January.The MPs’ vote today is one of the most fateful parliamentary votes in British history.The mere fact that Mrs May went to Strasbourg yesterday evening for a meeting with Mr Juncker sends a strong signal that the Prime Minister is confident that she’s got a deal.          \u0027If Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured), and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of CommonsMay returns to Downing Street after winning \u0027legally binding...Trouble for Jeremy Corbyn? Almost 100 Labour MPs and peers...Share this articleShe hardly want to risk a humiliating failure.But remember this. The Prime Minister is not the ultimate arbiter. She will have to defer to her Attorney General. In uncanny ways Mr Cox finds himself in the same situation as his predecessor Lord (Peter) Goldsmith found himself in ahead of the Iraq war in 2003.Tony Blair was desperate to invade. But he could not give the order to send troops to Iraq until he received a formal undertaking from Goldsmith that the war was legal. And we now know that Blair twisted Lord Goldsmith’s arm to ensure that he came to the ‘right’ decision.Geoffrey Cox is thought to be made of sterner stuff. Unlike the hapless Goldsmith, MPs believe he is his own man.Last January he struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’.That is why Mrs May needs Mr Cox to confirm that the Irish backstop problem has been solved. A Cox veto – and she and her deal are both finished.Crucially, Mr Cox did not fly to Strasbourg with Mrs May. He stayed at Westminster, keeping his distance.          \u0027Last January Geoffrey Cox (pictured) struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’Very wise. More than anyone else, Mr Cox has the future of Mrs May in his hands. And – far more importantly – Britain’s future in the EU.Brexiteers insist, nevertheless, that even he does not have the final say. Members of the European Research Group of hardline rebels have employed a team of eight lawyers to make their own judgment. Who can say what advice they will give?Nevertheless, matters were looking much more hopeful last night. There was a spring in the Prime Minister’s step.We will know later today whether she achieved enough to convince the Tory rebels.If she hasn’t, Britain is on course to crash out of the European Union without a deal on March 29.Matters will no longer be in Mrs May’s hands. With time running out, Parliament could move to delay the implementation of Article 50 and rule out No Deal. In which case, political and economic upheaval looms. The stakes could not be higher. "},{"url":null,"title":"Princess Margarets love heavenly nephew Prince Charles revealed newly uncovered letters","story":"Margaret with her friend Sharman Douglas at Royal Ascot in 1950.

But what was the point of going up there to stay there on my own?What should I do with a house that had been such a huge and emotional and beloved part of her life for so long?For most of the past 30 years we had lived there half the year, roughly from May till October. We made a rule never to come to London when we were there, and vice versa. We broke it a few times, for family dramas, and of course they made visits, but it meant we only made that awful M1M6 journey once a year. How perfect is that?In each house, Loweswater and London, both by chance dating from the 1860s, our basic working life was exactly the same. We were at our desks each morning, moving words around. In Lakeland, my wife sat with her pen and ink, smiling quietly to herself when she heard me effing and blinding as the electricity went off, yet again, or the broadband was down.In the afternoon, we walked. In London, walking down Kentish Town High Road, going for my regular swims, you have to try hard to breathe — not quite the same as rambling round beautiful Crummock Water.A few years after we moved in I bought five fields, around 15 acres, which surround the house. I created an orchard, tree house and rebuilt the drystone walls.I loved our little town of Cockermouth, an architectural gem, where I swam three times a week, poked around the antique shops, met local friends, had lunch. I did get upset when anyone asked, ‘Enjoying your holidays?’ ‘Do you mind?’ I’d say. ‘We live here.’I liked to think I was part of the community all those years, entering for the Loweswater Show, taking part in events, getting to know everyone. It took time. Cumbrian farming folk winter you, they summer you, winter you again — then they say hello.

We hesitated and said London, but only when the time comes, so we stressed. London is, after all, where our children and grandchildren live.Alas, with the death of Margaret, the time came to decide. What would happen if I was living there on my own? Aged 80, what would happen if I was ill, with my local GP seven miles away?As for hospitals, God knows where they are now.

HUNTER DAVIES reveals the joys and...How do I work the dishwasher again? Writer Hunter Davies,...Share this articleSome months after Margaret died, I spent six weeks on my own in Loweswater to see if I could stand it, if I could survive being on my own in a fairly large and remote house.It was a strange feeling. In London I had grown used by now to the absence of Margaret. At first I’d think I could see her through the window, sitting reading on the downstairs couch when I came home through the back way, walking across the garden, but that soon faded. I was so busy in London, so active, so many social activities.In Loweswater, though, during those weeks on my own, I imagined she was there, in the house with me, all the time.Each day when I came back from my walk to the lake, or from Cockermouth, I opened the front door and I expected to find a note from her, written in her bold and impeccable handwriting.The notes normally contained one of three messages:Do not disturb. I am working. Answer your own bloody phone calls, it has gone non-stop.Have gone to the lake, down the Lonning, back the Scenic Way.If it was the latter, and she had put the time she left, I would immediately turn round and go and meet her.In Lakeland, it had always been just us, we two, at constant close quarters, in a remote rural situation. Little wonder I now sensed and saw her presence all the time.In London, we had our three children living near by, and grandchildren, friends and neighbours we had known for 50 years, visitors for work and pleasure popping in. In London there were always distractions. In Lakeland, I was alone with my thoughts and memories. So I decided to sell.          It was a strange feeling. In London I had grown used by now to the absence of Margaret. In Loweswater, though, during those weeks on my own, I imagined she was there, in the house with me, all the timeThe local estate agent I contacted to do the dirty deed — well, it seems dirty to me, awfully disloyal to Lakeland — boasted that they employed a drone and a fully qualified drone pilot. The idea was to hover in the air, about 400ft high, film and photograph our lovely house, and my lovely five fields, and show the three lovely lakes within walking distance. Isn’t modern technology grand?I had decided to show all prospective buyers round the house myself, to talk to them, find out where they were from, what they were really looking for.After all, I knew the house, knew the problems and pleasures — unlike the estate agents.It was such an intimate experience, showing strangers your bedroom, watching them lift up carpets you would rather they did not, avoiding sinks for fear of catching the plague, or entering a room and making a face at your wallpaper.In the end there were six who were seriously interested. Four were roughly local while two had come from farther afield. One was from London and the other from the West Country, both men who had left their wives at home. They each stayed overnight locally, returning the next morning for a second look.I was amazed they were investing so much time. Then I remembered that when we bought the house I had come from London on the train for the day, on my own. It could well have been a total waste of time.Blow me, next day both men made offers — at the asking price. I suppose I could have tried to get them higher, but I was so delighted by their enthusiasm for the area, which they already knew well, and their clear love for the house.I had cross-examined each about their finances when I had taken them round, subtly of course. I am known in our family for being subtle and discreet — har har. The one from the West Country would be getting a mortgage on his existing house while the Londoner appeared to have the cash already, having sold some internet company. It could have been a lie of course, but I believed him.He turned out to be a Tottenham Hotspur season-ticket holder, so clearly a man who was totally sensible and reliable. I don’t think I could have sold it to an Arsenal fan. So I accepted his offer.He then wanted a full survey done, which was a bit of a worry. When I bought the house at auction, I never had a survey. I decided I loved it so much that I would accept any faults. Just like falling in love with my dear wife.But the survey was OK and the Londoner hurried me into a quick sale, offering to exchange contracts and complete all on the same day. Usually there is a gap of about a month. It meant I had to clear up and empty the house much more quickly than I had planned.In a way, the speed made the agony less. I was too busy to mope and mourn or have any second thoughts — which I had been having, thinking, Oh God, what have I done? It was not just that Margaret had died. I now felt part of me was dying as well.I had to quickly get rid of all the furniture and my treasures — or what I call my treasures. The real rubbish I dumped, lesser rubbish went to charity shops, while some of the choicer items I gave away, such as an 1810 guidebook to Lakeland, written anonymously by Wordsworth, which I gave to his home, Dove Cottage.The ordinary domestic stuff went into Mitchells auction house in Cockermouth in their ordinary domestic weekly sales. That was agony, seeing items of furniture we so loved, comfy fireside easy chairs we had spent a fortune re-covering, going for piddling sums.I don’t know why people ever buy new stuff when you can get excellent second-hand furniture so reasonably.Yet the price fetched for one tatty item, a stuffed red squirrel in a wooden case which was falling to pieces, amazed me. I had kept it in the fireplace in my office and looked at it every day as I sat down to work, thinking I really should repair it or at least dust it. It must have been harbouring appalling germs. It went for £60.I didn’t go to any of the sales. I couldn’t bear to see any of my beloved objects being brutally dismissed, going for peanuts or, worst of all, ending up with that dreaded word beside them — unsold.I SPENT the final two nights in an empty house, lying on a mattress on the wooden floor in an empty bedroom. All the contents, the domestic junk as well as the treasures, had gone.Getting down on the floor was relatively easy — you just flop, collapse — but getting up, oh my God, that was agony. I had to roll over and somehow prop myself up with my elbow. I had not realised how low a floor is, and how high a normal bed is. Or how old I was. So I flopped back on the mattress again. I felt like a squatter in someone else’s neglected, forgotten home.I stared round at the bedroom walls. I could see the faded patches where our prized paintings had been. I stared out of the naked windows at Grasmoor, the looming fell after which our house is named.All 14 windows in the house have stunning views, back and front, of the fells and fields, lakes and landscape. The curtains had gone as well, after the man from Mitchells pointed out they were Sandersons, in William Morris design, and would fetch some money. Good job Margaret never told me how much she had spent on them. I would have moaned.Lying there, with my eyes closed, I could see the family and all the visitors to the house over the years. I could see John Prescott, whose autobiography I ghostwrote, and his lovely wife Pauline both sitting in our garden, with two heavies in a corner, keeping an eye on him, as he was deputy prime minister at the time.I could hear my fellow Cumbrian Melvyn Bragg admiring my conservatory, asking how I had got planning permission. I could see all our three children and grandchildren at my wife’s 70th birthday party eight years earlier.On my very last day in the house, our son Jake and his wife Rosa drove up to help me bring stuff back to London — the personal bits and pieces, photographs and mementos, nothing really valuable, just things I wanted to keep. We reminisced of course about their memories of the house and of Margaret in it, such as the time, on her 50th birthday, she had got up at five o’clock and climbed Red Pike.The night before, when asked what she really wanted on her birthday, she said her special treat would be to climb Red Pike first thing in the morning with me. I said great, I’ll come. Alas, I slept in and never heard her getting up.She brought me tea in bed at eight as usual and I remarked that her hair was wet.‘Oh, is it?’ she said. ‘Probably because I got up at five and climbed Red Pike and had a swim in Crummock. I nearly woke you, but you were sound asleep . . .’I love this story, even if it is at my expense. It has become a family legend — the image of her going off on her own, enjoying herself so much, then gently boasting about it.Jake now does not quite believe it. He recently got out the map and thinks she could not have got as far as the top of Red Pike and back in three hours from our house. But she had obviously been somewhere, I said. Her hair was wet. She must have had a swim. He still does not believe it.Margaret did tend to ‘improve’ stories, exaggerate, but then she was a proper novelist. I plan to believe that story for ever, that she did climb Red Pike and swim in the lake on her 50th birthday.And that was the house sold, 30 years of our life cleared away, packed up, gone for ever. Only the memories remain.AS you get older, many things mean less. Money for example. I can’t afford any more time or energy to think about making money. Time is too short.My only worry now, as I write and as I lie awake in the middle of the night, is that something awful will happen to my back, or my hernia will explode. So far, so good.I don’t really worry, or get depressed, or not for long — half an hour perhaps. It is usually to do with my stupid computer playing up, trying to buy or book something on the internet.But if I become housebound or bedridden, in constant pain and agony, I don’t know how I would cope. My cheerful-chappie character might prove a mirage.I would never willingly end my life, which Margaret always said she would, sending regular donations to Dignitas. In the end, she did not have the strength to leave the house and go to Switzerland.I am staying here in this house, whatever happens. I plan to finish myself off with an enormous amount of Beaujolais.I had a drink recently with an old friend and neighbour who used to be the chief economic advisor at the Treasury. He said that economic studies indicate people in their 70s underestimate how long they have to live — in other words, they fear they will pop off soon, so they start worrying about spending too much, saving hard in case they will be a burden and end up with a long and expensive and awful ailment.In fact, most of the 70-year-olds today do reach their 80s, and then they overestimate — thinking, Hurrah, got this far, got ages to live yet. And, of course, they have got this wrong.We folks entering our 80s have to realise we will be lucky to reach 84. In fact, only a quarter of people in their 80s end up suffering a long and expensive illness, which is why people who die in their 80s leave more than they intended to, luckily for the Treasury. I never really quite believe or understand these economic surveys, but I intend to take two morals from what I think my friend told me and intend to follow them from now on.Live, live, live. Spend, spend, spend.

The Prime Minister smelt a deal in the offing. One that could help her muster enough support in the House of Commons.But is she right?Has Mrs May extracted enough from Brussels to satisfy the 118 Tory Brexiteers who voted down her deal in January – in the process inflicting the largest defeat on a sitting prime minister in living memory?We won’t know the answer to that question till later today, but the problem is simple to explain. Mrs May cannot hope to get the support of Tory rebels if her withdrawal arrangement leaves Britain stuck forever in the Irish backstop – meaning that Northern Ireland must stay in the customs union, subject to European rules but with no decision making capacity.Brexiteers say that such an arrangement turns Britain into a ‘vassal state’. Not in a million years will they vote for it.However, if Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of Commons.Last night the Government and Brussels agreed a plan that could enable Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to alter his legal advice on the backstop.The package includes a new legally-binding document that should allow the UK to seek an exit from the backstop if the EU tries to make it permanent, along with legal status for a separate package of assurances offered by Brussels in January.The MPs’ vote today is one of the most fateful parliamentary votes in British history.The mere fact that Mrs May went to Strasbourg yesterday evening for a meeting with Mr Juncker sends a strong signal that the Prime Minister is confident that she’s got a deal.          \u0027If Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured), and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of CommonsMay returns to Downing Street after winning \u0027legally binding...Trouble for Jeremy Corbyn? Almost 100 Labour MPs and peers...Share this articleShe hardly want to risk a humiliating failure.But remember this. The Prime Minister is not the ultimate arbiter. She will have to defer to her Attorney General. In uncanny ways Mr Cox finds himself in the same situation as his predecessor Lord (Peter) Goldsmith found himself in ahead of the Iraq war in 2003.Tony Blair was desperate to invade. But he could not give the order to send troops to Iraq until he received a formal undertaking from Goldsmith that the war was legal. And we now know that Blair twisted Lord Goldsmith’s arm to ensure that he came to the ‘right’ decision.Geoffrey Cox is thought to be made of sterner stuff. Unlike the hapless Goldsmith, MPs believe he is his own man.Last January he struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’.That is why Mrs May needs Mr Cox to confirm that the Irish backstop problem has been solved. A Cox veto – and she and her deal are both finished.Crucially, Mr Cox did not fly to Strasbourg with Mrs May. He stayed at Westminster, keeping his distance.          \u0027Last January Geoffrey Cox (pictured) struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’Very wise. More than anyone else, Mr Cox has the future of Mrs May in his hands. And – far more importantly – Britain’s future in the EU.Brexiteers insist, nevertheless, that even he does not have the final say. Members of the European Research Group of hardline rebels have employed a team of eight lawyers to make their own judgment. Who can say what advice they will give?Nevertheless, matters were looking much more hopeful last night. There was a spring in the Prime Minister’s step.We will know later today whether she achieved enough to convince the Tory rebels.If she hasn’t, Britain is on course to crash out of the European Union without a deal on March 29.Matters will no longer be in Mrs May’s hands. With time running out, Parliament could move to delay the implementation of Article 50 and rule out No Deal. In which case, political and economic upheaval looms. The stakes could not be higher. "},{"url":null,"title":"Creators Peppa Pig admit cartoon initially bored people","story":"    Neville Astley (centre) and Mark Baker (right)nmade their fortune thanks to young Peppa, whose children’s programme has since been broadcast in 180 territories and translated into 40 languages          The creators of Peppa Pig admitted they were worried the idea would never get off the ground, and that people were initially bored of the idea‘People in the pub would ask us, “What are you drawing?” We’d say, “A pig, called Peppa, it’s going to be big.” They’d lose interest and wander off’, explained Astley.The pair created Peppa and her family working in each other’s houses or at the local pub.They told the Radio Times they were inspired by 1970s cartoon classics including Roobarb and Pingu, after realising that children ‘like stories about animals’.The beloved show has now been running for 15 years.Revealed: The real cost of spending a penny at night as...Amazon Alexa, children\u0027s books and herbal tea are added to...Share this article‘We’d made this little trailer for Peppa but hadn’t got anywhere,’ recalled Baker.‘It’s very difficult to sell your own creative work.

Holidaymakers took to social media to voice their concerns. Lucy Barcoo asked TUI on Twitter: \u0027Can you please tell me which type of aircraft my flight home from Ibiza will be on please?

Had I known I\u0027d probably still be where I was at.\u0027And a woman named as Carly M. added: \u0027It\u0027s really scary.\u0027Boeing has described the MAX series as its fastest-selling family of planes, with more than 5,000 orders placed to date from about 100 customers.But not since the 1970s - when the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 had successive fatal incidents - has a new model been involved in two deadly accidents in such a short period.The weekend crash sent Boeing shares noseing as much as 12 percent on Monday.The plane involved in Sunday\u0027s crash was less than four months old, with Ethiopian Airlines saying it was delivered on November 15.It went down near the village of Tulu Fara, some 40 miles (60 kilometers) east of Addis Ababa.One witness has told The Associated Press that smoke was coming from the plane\u0027s rear before it crashed in a rural field. \u0027The plane rotated two times in the air, and it had some smoke coming from the back then, it hit the ground and exploded,\u0027 Tamrat Abera said. Inhabitants of the remote area looked on from behind a security cordon as inspectors searched the crash site and excavated it with a mechanical digger.The single-aisle Boeing jet had left a deep, black crater.Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot was given clearance to turn around after indicating problems shortly before the plane disappeared from radar.The airline\u0027s chief executive Tewolde GebreMariam said the plane had flown in from Johannesburg early Sunday, spent three hours in Addis and was \u0027dispatched with no remark,\u0027 meaning no problems were flagged.The crash cast a pall over a gathering of the UN Environment Programme as it opened in Nairobi - at least 22 staff from several UN agencies were on board the doomed flight.Delegates hugged and comforted one another as they arrived at the meeting with the UN flag flying at half-mast.Other passengers included tourists and business travelers.Kenya had the highest death toll among the nationalities on the flight with 32, according to Ethiopian Airlines. Canada was next with 18 victims.There were also passengers from other countries including Ethiopia, Italy, the US, Britain and France.Among those on board was Italian archaeologist Sebastiano Tusa, 66, his wife Valeria Patrizia Li Vigni was quoted as saying by the Corriere della Sera newspaper.On Sunday, \u0027the friends I met at mass said I shouldn\u0027t worry because bad news travels fast,\u0027 she said.\u0027In the end it arrived anyway, and it destroyed my life.

An email from the medical student was circulated to all postgrad, third year and final year computer science students by the department on Monday. The email said the proposed mobile phone app, called Consent, would “ensure consent is recorded” prior to sex. The head of computer science at UCD Prof Pádraig Cunningham said the email was distributed by the school in error. The email, as well as correspondence forwarding it to students from the computer science department, have been seen by The . The app would allow for a “clear opportunity” for a person to express that they did not wish to “continue in the act”, the email said. The app would also eliminate “the lack of communication which is responsible for the destruction of thousands of lives every year”. Computer science students would be given an equity share in the proposed venture for their work developing the product, the medical student’s email said. The email proposing the venture was circulated by a staff member working in the computer science school. Responding to queries from The , the medical student leading the project said he had received 26 responses to his email. “Out of the 26 responses, we got 24 positive, two misinterpreted it. Perhaps my wording was very flawed and misleading on the primary email,” he said. ‘Legal rights’The app idea would “not change the legal rights of an inidual, only establishingrecording onset of consent”, the student said. “The very instant I feel this app would be doing harm, I will be the first to terminate it,” he said. In a statement to students on Tuesday morning, Prof Cunningham said the “school emailing lists should not have been used to circulate this email. It was issued in error. Please disregard the email”.The email had not been “reviewed and approved” by the school before it was forwarded to students, he said. “On behalf of the school, I would like to sincerely apologise to the students who have received this email and for the offence it has caused,” he told students. Prof Cunningham said the school would “review and improve its approval process for all proposed emails to be sent to students on our lists, to ensure that this can not happen again”.Barry Murphy, head of the UCD students’ union, said he was “appalled” at the contents of the message sent to students. “This app will not solve any consent related issues.

Video: European Commission\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission,   welcomes British prime minister Theresa May in Strasbourg. Photograph: Patrick SeegerEPAThe latest agreement between the EU and UK underlines that both sides will make every effort to avoid using the backstop – and to find a way out of it quickly if it is used. The UK has also given its interpretation of an arbitration system, designed to solve rows in relation to the backstop, arguing that this gives it further reassurance.MPs will vote (referred to as a ‘meaningful vote’) on this tonight. However UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox announced this morning that earlier legal advice he had given – that the UK risked being trapped in the backstop arrangements – remained unchanged, even if the risk of this happening was now less than previously. So it now looks unlikely that tonight’s vote will pass. Let’s wait and see how the afternoon pans out. But by lunchtime the indications were that both the Brexiteer European Research Group and the DUP both felt the deal did not deliver what they were looking for.Why has the backstop become such a big deal?Because it cuts to the heart of the Brexit argument and pushes the UK to define what it wants life after Brexit to look like – something UK politics is finding very hard to do. And because the DUP have the whip hand in the House of Commons, supporting Theresa May’s government. To ensure there would be no hard Irish border – one where checks on goods movements are needed – the withdrawal agreement includes the backstop as an insurance policy, something which would apply unless and until some other way to avoid a hard border was found. This would be achieved by the UK staying in a basic customs unions with the EU and Northern Ireland following all of the EU’s customs and regulatory rules. In this way no checks would be needed at the Irish Border and limited checks would be needed on goods, food and animals crossing the Irish Sea. So what happened last night?Following weeks of negotiation, Theresa May’s dash to Strasbourg produced three items.The first was what is called an instrument, a document which sits alongside the withdrawal agreement and gives an agreed interpretation of it. It underlines the commitment of both sides to try to avoid using the backstop by reaching a new trade deal and also to examine other technological alternatives. Progress would be reviewed regularly every six months under a process in the agreement. It includes reference to both sides making “ best endeavours” to avoid the backstop. It says that if the EU was found to have acted in bad faith by a joint arbitration agreement, the UK could “suspend” the backstop for a period.The second change was in the political declaration, a document accompanying the withdrawal agreement outlining how both sides see the future relationship working. It also underlines the commitment to work quickly on a new trade deal and look at alternatives to the backstop.What does it mean?It does give the UK more assurance that the EU side will do all it can to avoid using the backstop – certainly in the long term. And it does underline how it feels the arbitration mechanism could be used, if the talks do break down. However it does not give the UK a unilateral exit route from the backstop. It cannot decide itself simply to abandon it – it has to use the mechanisms in the agreement. This is more or less what the UK attorney general concluded. He said that what was agreed in Strasbourg does “ reduce the risk” of the UK being “indefinitely and involuntarily detained” within the backstop provisions, at least in so far as this was due to bad faith by the EU or lack of engagement by it in seeking alternatives. However, crucially, his original legal advice is unchanged, which was that the UK could end up with no way out of the backstop agreement. This looks like undermining the chances of the vote passing tonight. However the AG told the Commons that this was a political decision, as opposed to a strictly legal one. It remains to be seen how the different groups will vote.What will the ‘meaningful vote’ mean?If the MPs did vote for the withdrawal agreement – now or later – then the UK leaves the EU with a deal. This means the transition period kicks in once the UK leaves . This would mean no immediate change in trading arrangements and no disruption. The transition period if due to last until the end of 2020, though this can be extended to the end of 2022. The UK is currently due to leave on March 29th, though there is speculation that even if the agreement is passed a short extension could be needed to allow the necessary legislation to pass. However support for the deal looks most unlikely now in tonight’s vote, following the Cox advice.If the MPs reject the agreement again, then what happens after that is unclear. Much would depend on the extent of the defeat – and whether there was any hope of a third vote passing. Theresa May has promised, in the event of rejection, to allow MPs to vote on Wednesday on whether or not they supported a no-deal exit and on Thursday on whether they wanted an extension to the Article 50 exit period. They could well vote against a no-deal and for an extension. But as the EU side has to agree to an extension and it will want some reason to do so, it is hard to predict what would happen.Discussions could move to the EU summit on March 21st-22nd, just a week before Brexit. An extension might be agreed to allow more time to talk or to give more time to prepare for a no-deal. But as the rest of the EU has not formally discussed this, it is hard to predict.Beyond that it is unclear whether the prime minister could retain the support of her party, or there might even be a UK general election. There is support in the House of Commons for a softer Brexit – involving closer trading links with the EU – and speculation that MPs may try to grab control of the agenda to force events in this direction.However a rejection by MPs will also put the risk of a no-deal exit back on the table. By severing trading links between the EU and UK overnight this would lead to disruption and significant economic risk for the UK – and for Ireland . It remains the case that to avoid a no-deal exit, something has to be agreed between the two sides and politically supported in the UK. It is the default option.

Photograp: Frederick FlorinAFPGetty Images.When Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke at length on Tuesday strongly recommending the deal reached between the EU and Theresa May in Strasbourg the night before, he carefully avoided touching on a particular point. That was the third element of the British prime minister’s latest Brexit package — a unilateral declaration by the UK, apparently interpreting its rights in a radically different way.The declaration has not been circulated by the EU Brexit taskforce along with other statements and scripts, and European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker was notably silent on the issue at his press conference with Mrs May. They seem to be saying it is ‘none of our business’. “The British are speaking to themselves,” one Irish source said. And there’s no point in frightening the horses just before they run.The joint interpretation of the withdrawal agreement, which is to be given an enhanced legal status, does not provide the UK with a means it had sought to unilaterally exit the Irish backstop should an acceptable alternative not prove forthcoming. Undaunted, and facing a mountain to climb in winning over a House of Commons majority for her deal on Tuesday night, May has nevertheless decided to assert such a right. Or give the appearance of doing so. MarginalBoth other “agreed” elements of Monday’s package represent only marginal advances on the backstop assurances that had previously been agreed, or on commitments to work urgently and in good faith to replace it. And, having failed to reopen the withdrawal agreement, Mrs May has decided to provide backbench Brexiteers what they have always sought, a macho assertion that the UK can simply do its own thing.Her argument, reprises a case made by the British for some time that Article 50, the departure clause which is the basis of the withdrawal agreement, provides a legal basis only for temporary measures. Should the backstop provisions appear to be acquiring permanence because of bad faith on the part of the EU in negotiations on an alternative, he argues, the UK could deem its obligations under the backstop to be withering away. And it could walk away from them.ArbitrationAdmittedly the declaration appears to hedge its bets by then referring to such a move as being “in accordance” with the withdrawal agreement’s provisions — an ambiguous reference that can either be seen as an acceptance of the latter’s procedures, notably of binding arbitration, or a claim to support for the UK’s unilateralist interpretation of the agreement. But although couched in legal language the declaration is essentially a political document, binding on no-one, whose function is to reassure those looking for an opportunity to back Mrs May. It’s all about the appearance it gives.For the EU and Irish lawyers the British argument is flawed. They say that if provisions are deemed necessary for achieving an orderly withdrawal from the union — and the backstop is such — they can be sustained under Article 50. Ultimately it is a matter for the courts. But that is a long way down the road and if the UK interpretation helps to kick the can down the road, no one is going to argue publicly with it.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May faces defeat in a crucial vote. Photograph: Reuters TVTheresa May’s hopes of securing House of Commons approval for her Brexit deal suffered a shattering blow as leading Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP said they would vote against her agreement on Tuesday night.The DUP said in a statement that the British prime minister had not achieved sufficient progress in her Brexit negotiations “at this time” but that it was still possible to reach a deal with further talks.The so-called “Star Chamber” of lawyers convened by the Leave-backing European Research Group found that agreements reached by Mrs May in 11th-hour talks in Strasbourg do not deliver the legally-binding changes the Commons has demanded.Their judgment came after British attorney general Geoffrey Cox told MPs that the changes “reduce the risk” that the UK could be trapped indefinitely in the backstop, but do not remove it altogether.Mr Cox said that “the legal risk remains unchanged” of the UK being unable to leave the backstop without EU agreement.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Cox had confirmed that “no significant changes” had been secured in two months of negotiations and the Government’s strategy was “in tatters”.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mrs May defended her plan as a good deal compared to a series of unattractive alternatives. “If this vote is not passed tonight, if this deal is not passed, then Brexit could be lost,” a hoarse-voiced Mrs May said. MPs are expected to vote on the deal at 7pm.Mrs May said seeking an extension to the Brexit negotiating period would hand control of the process to the EU.If May’s deal is rejected, MPs will then be given the opportunity on Wednesday to vote on whether to leave without a deal and on Thursday on whether seek a delay to Brexit.“It would not change the debate or the questions that need to be settled – it would merely pass control to the European Union, ” Mrs May told parliament of a possible extension. “They would decide how long an extension to offer, meaning we may not get what we ask for, they could even impose conditions on an extension. That could mean moving to a Brexit that does not meet the expectations of those who voted to leave or even moving to a second referendum.”Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, warned that defeat in the second “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday evening would lead to a general election.Mrs May’s deal was rejected by 230 votes in a Commons ballot in January.Mr Walker told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: “If it doesn’t go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks.“It is not sustainable, the current situation in parliament.”Mr Cox’s advice was issued the morning after Mrs May’s dash to Strasbourg to finalise a deal with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker which she said would reassure MPs that the backstop arrangements to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit would not become permanent.The pair agreed a “joint instrument” setting out the legally-binding nature of their promises to seek alternative arrangements to avoid the need for a backstop, as well as a “supplement” to November’s political declaration making clear that they will seek swiftly to seal a deal on their new trade and security relationship.Alongside these documents was a “unilateral declaration by the UK” which sets out “sovereign action” by which Britain could seek to have the backstop removed if the EU acted in bad faith.On a day of high drama in Westminster, the cabinet gave its backing to the package at its weekly meeting chaired by the prime minister at 10 Downing Street.Mrs May said passing the vote would allow the country to move on to a brighter future, while the alternative was uncertainty with no guarantee of what happens next.Before heading to the Commons to address Tory MPs and make a statement to the House, she concluded the meeting by saying: “Today is the day. Let’s get this done.”But momentum seemed to be shifting against the prime minister, as Mr Cox released his advice.He said that the documents agreed in Strasbourg “reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained” in the backstop if the EU fails to show good faith in negotiating a trade deal to replace it.But he warned that the question of whether a satisfactory agreement on a future UKEU relationship can be reached remains “a political judgment”.And he said “the legal risk remains unchanged” that if no such agreement can be reached due to “intractable differences”, the UK would have “no internationally lawful means” of leaving the backstop without EU agreement.In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cox told MPs: “There is no ultimate unilateral right out of this arrangement. The risk of that continues.“But the question is whether it is a likelihood, politically.”Moments later, the Star Chamber issued its opinion: “Yesterday’s documents considered inidually and collectively do not deliver ‘legally binding changes’ to the WA or to the (backstop) Protocol.“They fail to fulfil the commitment made by government to the House in response to the Brady amendment ‘to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement’.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday morning the agreement reached between the UK and the EU on Monday night is “positive” and “does not undermine the backstop”.Speaking in Government buildings on Tuesday morning, Mr Varadkar said the outcome was “positive”.“I hope and trust that the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons”, Mr Varadkar told reporters at an 8am press conference in Government Buildings.At a late-night joint press conference with Mr Juncker on Monday, Mrs May said she “passionately believed” that three new documents provided the legal assurances critics of her stance had called for.“Now is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and to deliver on the instruction of the British people,” she said.Mr Juncker warned that if MPs voted down the deal a second time, “there will be no third chance”. And he said that any extension of the two-year article 50 negotiation process could not go beyond May 23rd unless the UK took part in European Parliament elections beginning that day.If the package passes the Commons, leaders of the 27 remaining EU states will be asked to endorse the new documents at a scheduled European Council summit in Brussels on March 21st-22nd, before the final step of ratification by the European Parliament. – AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

I contacted the RSPCA and said that I was looking for a male Staffie, around one to two years old, and one evening I was watching the news when Snoop\u0027s story came on.“What happened to him was shocking, and it was clear from the footage - in the way that he tried to get back into the car - that he was a loyal dog. I thought that he seemed like the perfect dog for me and that I could offer him the home he deserved.”CCTV screengrab issued by the RSPCA of a man abandoning a Staffordshire bull terrier in Trentham on Monday December 17 Snoop is still suffering from separation anxiety, as a result of his abandonment, and needed a home where someone was around all day, according to the RSPCA.He now has a large garden and surrounding fields to run around in, and has settled into his new lifestyle so well that he is considered a “regular” at the local pub.Mr Squire added: “He is a fantastic dog and he settled in straight away. As soon as he came into the house for the first time, he jumped on the sofa and it was as though he decided that was the space for him.“He loves to lie on the back of the sofa and if I put the fire on he will curl up in front of it. He loves being warm and if he can find his way into a bedroom, you\u0027ll find him under the duvet with his head on the pillow.”Rachel Butler, from the RSPCA, said the dog\u0027s story had put a “spotlight” on the daily reality of pet abandonment.She added: “He was dumped at Christmas, a time of year which we spend with our loved ones, so for something so unloving to happen to him was heartbreaking. But the love and attention he is getting now from Laurence is wonderful.”The charity said it had other Staffies available for re-homing on its website.Meanwhile, the inquiry into who left Snoop at the roadside is continuing.The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)Will Theresa May win tonight\u0026#39s Brexit vote?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe star of the event – hinted at in the invitation –\u0026nbspis going to be Apple\u0027s brand new subscriptions service. It will be something like Netflix or Amazon Prime, offering you films and TV for a monthly cost.Plenty of the actual shows and films that are coming to this have been leaked in some form, since Apple has had to work with the notoriously chatty entertainment industry. It has meant the process has been a lot less secretive than normal, and there have been months of rumours.Apple confirms March event with TV service and news expectedNow those rumours are coming to a head, and the event will see the launch of that service. It\u0027s likely to come with some exclusive and original content at launch, as well as a range of films and TV by other companies.As well as streaming videos, Apple is rumoured to be offering a news and magazine subscription service. It appears that people will be able to sign up on their iPad or their computer, and then receive regular issues.Apple already offered this kind of service, when the iPad\u0026nbspfirst came out – a feature called Newsstand allowed people to sign up for magazines and pay for them\u0026nbspthrough Apple. And it has been rolling out subscriptions more generally, encouraging app makers to make their products available through regular payments.But the new version is expected to receive new features, as well as more attention.This event has repeatedly been said to be a services one, and they are likely to be the star of the show. But there could be some hardware, if only in service of the software.If that happens, it\u0027s most likely to be an iPad. It makes perfect sense as a way to show off video and magazines from the new subscription services, and the updates do tend to come in March.The new iPad\u0026nbspupdate isn\u0027t expected to be a drastic rethink, and indeed will keep familiar features that disappeared from the iPad Pro, such as the headphone jack and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. But it will probably get the usual changes, like faster processor and better cameras.Ever since they were released, rumours have swirled about an update to the AirPods. And it might finally be coming – soon, if not at this event.Suggested new features for the new earphones have been various: better Bluetooth technologies, improved batteries, always-on Hey Siri and maybe even breakthrough features like health monitoring through your ears.Rumours have suggested that Apple could actually release the earphones and the case separately. So Apple could choose to only launch the new wireless charging box at the event, and then update the earphones later this year.AirPower\u0026nbspwas first mentioned in 2017 – and hasn\u0027t really been heard from since. It was meant to be a charging mat that would allow users to wirelessly power their iPhones, Apple Watches and AirPods all at once, but technical issues appear to have delayed its release.Now would be as good a time as any for it to arrive, if Apple has fixed those problems, or to at least make some mention of where it is. It would also slot in nicely with the new AirPods, since the wireless charging case was always intended to work with AirPower.It\u0027s unlikely that there\u0027ll be much other hardware, and there almost certainly won\u0027t be anything major like a new iPhone.Apple could offer an updated colour for the iPhone XR, for instance, or new bands for the Apple Watch. But those products, and every other, are likely to have their own events and will be held back from this one to avoid them overshadowing it.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not long after he became children’s minister in January 2018, Mr\u0026nbspZahawi announced the appointment of a private company called Spectra First to\u0026nbspget more than 50 businesses to provide work-based opportunities to young people leaving the care system, including every government department.The competition to say the stupidest thing about Brexit has been wonDiary: Slick work brings in the cash for Tory MP Nadhim ZahawiNeigh way! MP Nadhim Zahawi apologises for stables expense claims“My diary secretary here is brilliant, I would hire her in a heartbeat,” Mr Zahawi says of one of his own hires. He has, since this interview took place, made her a permanent member of staff.\u0026nbsp“All they need is an opportunity in life. You just have to think about these kids in the round. You have to think about their life and their experiences slightly different to, dare I say it, our kids.”Mr Zahawi could not have had a more different start. He arrived in the UK at the age of nine,\u0026nbspthe child of Kurdish parents fleeing the war in Iraq. His first school was Holland Park, a comprehensive in west London. He later moved to Ibstock Place, a private school, and King’s College School, at the time an\u0026nbspindependent school for boys in Wimbledon.\u0026nbspHe won a place at University College London to study chemical engineering, but quickly showed an interest in businesses and started a property company after graduating. In business, he is best known for YouGov, the polling company he co-founded in a garden shed in 2000. He remained its chief executive until 2010, when he was elected to parliament.He gave up several additional business interests when he was\u0026nbspmade education minister in a cabinet reshuffle\u0026nbspin January 2018, including a £350,000-a-year, part-time job at Gulf Keystone, an oil company, and a 50 per cent stake in Zahawi and Zahawi, a firm he founded with his wife Lana in 2010.\u0026nbspBut Mr Zahawi\u0026nbspstill remembers how difficult it was to arrive in the country as a young boy, with no way to communicate.\u0026nbsp“You’re wrenched away from your friends and you come to a new country, you have to start all over again,” he says. “I sat at the back of the class, I didn’t want to get laughed at, trying to string the words together to make a sentence.”Language, he quickly understood, would be the key to moving ahead. “I worked out very quickly that if you communicate well, doors open for you,” he says.\u0026nbspI ask him whether he feels young people from Syria and Afghanistan trying to get to this country in search of a better life should be given the same opportunity. He explains that his family went through the weren’t asylum seekers, but\u0026nbspapplied for settled status through the immigration system to\u0026nbspset up a business in the UK. He believed that people who work hard should be allowed to come to the UK.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got a rigorous immigration system to do that,” he says. “We’ll be able to decide our own immigration policy post-Brexit. For genuine asylum seekers we should be welcoming.”Mr\u0026nbspZahawi backed leaving the European Union. “Brexit appeals to me for no other reason than I thought we could reform within the EU, but when that became undeliverable for David Cameron I reluctantly backed Brexit because I thought the direction of travel for the EU is not right for us.”He says he doesn’t believe the German people have bought into the so-called transfer union, in which wealth within the EU ends up supporting weaker southern economies. He also believes Britons\u0026nbspwould never back the idea of a European army, an idea loathed by Brexiteers, but also seen as highly unlikely: “We’re better off exiting and wishing them luck in their endeavours but securing a trade deal so that we have access to the single market.”He never set out to be a politician. But a chance encounter at university piqued his interest.\u0026nbsp“At the University College of London union, on the first week at university, there was a bloke handing out the Socialist Worker\u0026nbspoutside. It was thin and small and I politely declined his offer at which point he was so aggressive, I thought I would go and find out about what the other side thinks,” he remembers.He was elected Conservative councillor in Putney in 1994, where he remained until 2006. In the interim, he helped run Jeffrey Archer’s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of London in 1998. He was selected by the local Conservative association for the safe Tory seat of Stratford-on-Avon in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015\u0026nbspand 2017.\u0026nbspAs a member of parliament, Mr Zahawi has voted for reducing the rate of corporation tax and against an amendment in parliament on homes under a certain rent limit being “fit for human habitation”, notable because he is reported to have spent £25m\u0026nbspbuying property around London for buy-to-let and commercial use.\u0026nbspHis success in property has come later in life. After university, Mr Zahawi started an estate agency, but the business suffered when the property market entered a downturn in the Eighties. Mr Zahawi and his business partners were forced to liquidate.“The lesson there was that you don’t know how hard it is to make money unless you lose money,” he says. “It’s well worth all of us remembering in politics that every morning, millions of people get up and start a business or work in a small business and we have to make sure we deliver for them. It really does matter\u0026nbspthat what we do here does not hurt them and their prospects.”Small businesses are expected to be hit hardest by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Surveys show many businesses have already been affected. Business investment fell for four consecutive quarters in 2018 for the first time since the financial crisis, according to the ONS.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of businesses considered Brexit uncertainty to have already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, according to a survey conducted in October 2018 by the Confederation of British Industry. Falling numbers of migrants have created a squeeze among employers, with the manufacturing industry in particular facing the biggest worker shortage in 30 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.Are we heading for a softer Brexit next week?What exactly will be better for small businesses after Brexit? Mr Zahawi doesn’t pause for breath: “One, we’ll be able to trade with the rest of the world. Two, we should be able to trade healthily with Europe and continue to have that trade. And three we’ll have our own policies on immigration or any other issues delivered in the UK.”Despite the challenges of his work, Mr Zahawi says he pinches himself every morning to think that he has ended up where he has. “Look at me today, a boy born in Baghdad, now a member of parliament for Shakespeare and a minister in Her Majesty’s government,” he says. “This country is an amazing country, it really is.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

In 2008, he joined Lehman Brothers on an industrial placement as part of his degree at the University of Bath. Within three months, global financial markets had spiralled into meltdown leading to the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the US, and battering swathes of other financial institutions beyond recognition.Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and the global economy crumbled. Reflecting on that time, the now 30-year-old understands that he was much more fortunate than some of his older colleagues. As a bright-eyed graduate he was swiftly snapped up by one of the global investment banks that had emerged from the crash bruised but still breathing. He stayed with that organisation until 2012, when he took five months off to go travelling.“I was completely uninspired,” Rocha-Thomas, who now lives in Cambridge, says of his former employer. “The IT team I was part of was so far removed from any kind of purpose,” he adds. So when he got back to the UK, he decided to join The App Business, a start-up which helps large companies build mobile apps. At the time the company\u0026nbsphad 20 employees. In the seven years that Rocha-Thomas has been there, the workforce has ballooned to almost 200 and he feel like he\u0027s been instrumental in driving that expansion. He says it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding and has given him an immense sense of purpose.Rocha-Thomas\u0027 story is becoming increasingly common. Although graduate schemes at banks, consultancies and accounting firms for years represented a well-trodden path for many bright youngsters leaving top universities, signs have emerged that even some of the most prestigious employers are starting to lose their shine.How Lehman Brothers caused \u0027the worst financial crisis in history\u0027According to a study published last year by High Flyers, a market research company which specialises in student and graduate recruitment, employers in eight out of 13\u0026nbspkey industries and employment areas hired fewer graduates in 2017 than the year before, with the biggest drops in recruitment at the top accounting and professional services firms, and banking and financial companies.Just 9.6 per cent of all graduates surveyed applied for roles in investment banking, which represented the lowest proportion since 2009 when banks halted graduate recruitment in the wake of the global financial crisis. And over the past year, that trend is expected to have continued.\u0026nbspWhile some of the move is likely to have been driven by companies cutting their recruitment budget in the face of Brexit uncertainty and other economic pressures, experts say that increased competition from booming tech companies and entrepreneurial start-ups is also to blame.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateSeveral studies have highlighted that young people are no longer as motivated by money as they used to be, and are increasingly prioritising a sense of purpose over pay. Start-ups are tapping into this sentiment by offering professional newbies the opportunity to have an impact from the get go – something that would ordinarily be unthinkable in a large multinational.Gian Power worked at Deutsche Bank and PwC after graduating from Aston Business School in 2014. He quit big corporate life in 2017 to set up his own company called The Lion\u0027s Club, which brings together motivational speakers on subjects around well-being, work-life-balance, and overcoming challenges to reach your full personal and professional potential.Gian PowerYouTube)“When working at PwC, my hours were long and I spent most weekends studying. It was a sacrifice I chose to make but it was hard to find time to explore my own interests and purpose,” he says. “I wanted to be my own boss, I wanted to craft a life that makes me happy and allows me to do things that bring me happiness.”Edwin Lee\u0027s experience echoes this. He interned at RBC Capital Markets before joining JP Morgan full time in 2006 in New York, and rising to the position of managing director. At the end of 2017 he resigned and joined a friend who was setting up his own company,\u0026nbspCastle Ridge Asset Management,\u0026nbspthat uses investment strategies informed by artificial intelligence.He tells The Independent that, particularly during his final few years at the Wall Street stalwart, work-life balance became “a serious issue”.“I ran the corporate trading desk which meant I was at work before the markets opened and didn\u0027t leave until the bankers were done,” he says. Lee often worked more than 15 hours a day and if calls weren\u0027t taking over his weekends and evenings then travel to London, Hong Kong and Tokyo often was. His wife had just given birth to their daughter and he felt like he was not seeing her grow up. “It had to change”.Of his current job he says that it was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and that the autonomy was a considerable incentive. “It would be our team and our firm to build exactly as we like.”Already back in 2014, McGraw-Hill Education commissioned a survey of hundreds of US graduates which found that 73 per cent prioritised finding a job that they enjoy over one that pays well. And almost half of respondents said that they would favour a career that is beneficial to society.iStock)Lovell Corporation, a Canadian marketing company that focuses on connecting businesses with young professionals, published a research report in 2017 based on a survey of 2,000 young people, that found Generation Z – or those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s – to be a generation of “change-makers”. These are the young people currently entering the workforce.The top career choice for that demographic in the survey was entrepreneur, with a large proportion also citing the not-for-profit sector as their top pick.“These statistics demonstrate the inclination of younger workers to seek meaningful work that fulfils their personal goals and creates impact,” the study concluded.Gian Power on meditation and motivation in the face of family tragedyOther studies have shown that the generation of people entering today\u0027s workforce is also more sensitive to issues around ersity and inclusion, and that those people are increasingly looking for a company that reflects those qualities.\u0026nbspScores of banks, professional service firms and consultancies are still marred by a reputation of being dominated by white men, and progress towards a more erse workforce is proving sluggish. Gender pay gaps are stubborn and that\u0027s spoiling the appetite of not just young women.Speaking recently at Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u0027s annual Future Leaders Conference, Ruwan Weerasekera, the chief operating officer at Softbank Investment Advisers, the manager of the massive Saudi-Japanese backed technology fund, said that almost everyone working at his company was previously at Deutsche Bank, UBS or Goldman Sachs.Softbank attracts talent, he said, by being erse, forward looking and representing an “intersection between finance and technology”. Many of the firms his company invests in are focused on social responsibility, which he says is also a big driver for a heterogeneous pool of potential hires, and is likely one of the reasons why his current employer is the only place he has worked where “white men are in the minority”.\u0026nbspDoing well by doing goodSo what are large institutions, like investment banks, doing to combat the start-up-driven brain drain? Kathleen Hughes, a partner at Goldman Sachs, tells The Independent that her firm has recognised and acknowledged the need for change to address the priorities of the next generation.“Around 60 per cent of Goldman Sachs\u0027 workforce is millennial and they have very particular values. As they start their career, they will value things like giving back and making an impact,” she says, adding that this is something Goldman has started tapping into.When Crystelle\u0026nbspPereira\u0026nbspfirst joined Goldman Sachs she felt like she was competing in \u0027both a marathon and a sprint\u0027In recent years, Goldman launched what it calls the Analyst Impact Fund which provides an annual opportunity for the most junior workers to pitch their cases to invest in non-profit organisations they deem to be most worthy. A sizeable grant from the firm is then allocated to the winning organisation. “Giving back is important,” says Hughes, “and that\u0027s what we\u0027re addressing.”Acknowledging issues around work-life-balance and presenteeism is also high up on Hughes\u0027 list of priorities. She says that technology has represented a sea-change for the better in that flexible working is now an integral part of company culture.And the initiatives seem to be resonating where it matters. Arianna Roccio, a recent graduate who has been at Goldman Sachs for three years, says that flexibility has evolved dramatically even in the short time that she has been at the company. “It\u0027s not really about face time in the way you might think,” she says.propsects to entice employees\u0026nbsp(Getty)Crystelle Pereira, another recent graduate who works at Goldman, says that when she first joined she felt like she was competing in “both a marathon and a sprint”. Since then, however, the dialogue between graduates and their managers has improved, “especially around the importance of balance and downtime”.Other banks have also implemented measures to sweeten career prospects for potential employees and tune into the zeitgeist.\u0026nbspChuck Teixeira, chief administrative officer and head of transformation at HSBC\u0027s global banking and markets ision, tells The Independent that his company has had to “completely change our approach”.Forget Brexit. We might be approaching another global recessionCould a no-deal Brexit hit the economy sooner than we think?Political tensions in Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdownHe says that they\u0027ve recently launched internship and graduate programmes, in which new professionals are introduced to careers in data science and engineering – areas not traditionally associated with banking.“To attract talent to these programmes, we have had to get on campus face-to-face, run meet-ups and hackathons where engineers and data scientists work together to rapidly prototype products,” he explains. “We realise that HSBC is not front-of-mind for these capabilities so we are reaching out to the global market and positioning ourselves differently, including targeting talent in other industries,” he adds.\u0026nbspFkexible working needs to be intergal to company culture (GettyiStock)Will Rocha-Thomas, who these days serves on his company\u0027s team that is responsible for hiring and retaining talent, is also encouraged by the progress. But he says that large firms still have their work cut out for them, and it\u0027s not always straightforward for the entrepreneurial start-ups either.Finally, he says that another simple thing that many large and small firms are still getting wrong, is that they are not taking action in response to feedback.\u0026nbsp“This sounds obvious but it’s a struggle for many big, centralised companies where making a simple change is a huge endeavour,” he says. “When people feel unhappy about something, and feel like there’s nothing they can do to change it – even if they give honest feedback – they generally quit,” he adds.Former JP Morgan managing director Edwin Lee agrees. While he admits that there are a lot of things\u0026nbsplarge institutions are able to do to improve the satisfaction and work-life balance of staff, the shift has to first occur in the fundamental, cultural DNA of the firm. Only then can practical changes be implemented. And that\u0027s where he sees the hurdle.He says that measures like paid leave, flexible working arrangements, sabbaticals or even mobility opportunities – that are frequently a given at start-ups and newer tech companies – are still often at odds with managers\u0027 immediate objectives. Those, in turn, often centre around short-term goals and the next earnings report.So perhaps the first step is to simply expand the horizon: teach managers that change happens gradually and that the long-term satisfaction of employees is as critical to the long-term health of the firm as the next quarter\u0027s profit is. Delving into the unknown is always scary, but once you\u0027re in, the opportunities might just surprise you positively.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.Gerads has also done artwork for Batman (DC Comics)It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work. I write to give my kids a better life and the best thing for me has been to draw on what I’ve done. But I think I might be ready to talk about something else, now.”Mister Miracle by Tom King and Mitch Gerads is out now and\u0026nbsppublished by DC Comics.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The animal, which died when it was about seven-years-old, is one of the best preserved mammoths known to science. The team extracted tissue samples from the animal’s bone marrow and muscle, which they described as “well preserved”. They then began searching for cell nuclei remains. In total, 88 nucleus-like structures were collected from the muscle sample.Created with Sketch.Woolly mammoth found in Siberia to be displayed in Tokyo Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A 39,000-year-old female woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia arrives at an exhibition hall in Yokohama, south of TokyoThe snout of a 39,000-year-old female Woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia.

The team said following the procedure a “pronucleus-like structure budded from the injected … mammoth nucleus”.They also found possible signs of repair to damaged mammoth DNA.Despite the successes, the scientists did not observe the further cell ision necessary to create a viable egg, “possibly due to the extensive DNA damage in the transferred nuclei”.This marks a “significant step toward bringing mammoths back from the dead”, researcher Kei Miyamoto, one of the study’s authors told Japan’s Nikkei news outlet.“We want to move our study forward to the stage of cell ision,” he added, but acknowledged “we still have a long way to go”.Woolly mammoth DNA found in illegal ivory samples seized in CambodiaLast woolly mammoths on Earth ‘killed off by lack of water’Farmer digs up 15,000-year-old woolly mammoth in fieldMost mammoth populations died out between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk\u0026nbsppeninsula of Siberia until 9,650 years ago.But the species survived for another 5,000 years on Siberian islands, which became cut off from the mainland by retreating ice following the last ice age. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago – well beyond the dawn of human civilisation, but finally becoming extinct around the time of the construction of the pyramids of Giza in Egypt. There is no scientific consensus on the chief cause for the creatures’ demise, but climate change significantly reduced habitable parts of the globe for mammoths, and they were also hunted by humans.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

This is, as has been widely stated, wrong, and her tweet has been deleted, but there is another side to the story which is more favourable to McVey.First, though, the actual facts. As things stand the UK and Denmark have an absolute exemption from the obligation to join the euro. This was the famous “opt-out” from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which set in train the long process towards adopting the euro across much (though even now not all) of\u0026nbspthe EU. All the other member states of the EU in 1992 have now adopted the single currency some members that joined after 1992 and after the first wave of euro nations abolished their currencies in 1999\u0026nbsphave also adopted the euro – Slovenia in 2007, followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania in 2015.Altogether 19 of the 28 member states are members of the euro, including all of the largest economies except the UK. It has made trade and cross-border movements of money much smoother and made international pricing of goods and services more transparent, reducing business costs and adding modestly to economic growth.\u0026nbspHowever, despite this, others countries have not joined the euro, despite this being a formal accession treaty obligation once certain criteria are met. For example, Sweden, which joined in 1995, still retains its krona and shows little inclination\u0026nbspto adopt the euro nor, it seems,\u0026nbspare the European Commission and European Central Bank pushing the point.Should we purchase euros for a trip to Italy in April?By contrast other, weaker economies that might wish to ditch their own currencies in favour of the euro are not yet qualified to do so. The experience of Greece, which was allowed to join the currency probably before its economy was strong enough, has been instructive.\u0026nbspAs well as the UK and Denmark, other EU members still outside include Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.The problems with the single currency are well publicised, and have caused real economic harm and human misery among those countries that have\u0026nbspendured years of austerity to try and make themselves more competitive, andor pay for the banking rescues required after the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThat is why richer countries – which would be expected to bankroll the system – are wary of joining. The Greek example is why some weaker countries are also cautious about the disciplines imposed by the system, and why the richer countries are also disinclined to hurry them into the arrangement.\u0026nbspPresident Macron’s proposal for a “fiscal” union to complement the monetary union – effectively moving some macroeconomic decisions on overall levels of taxes, public spending and borrowing to the European level – have been rejected by Germany, which usually pays the bills (Finland and the Netherlands also chip in). So this inherently unstable system seems set to continue on its present basis.Whether the UK would be allowed its euro opt-out if it rejoined the EU in a few years’ time is impossible to predict,\u0026nbspbut it would not necessarily be granted.Where\u0026nbspMcVey and her cited journalist have a point is that the euro was originally regarded as essential to ensure a “level playing field” under the single market. Countries, in other words, cannot gain an “unfair” advantage by devaluing or “manipulating” their currency as a way out of their uncompetitiveness (usually stemming from poor productivity, high wages and too much debt).That logic applies as much today and in the 2020s as is it did in 1992. There may come a point when the political pressure on non-euro members to join the currency – whatever the legal formalities – would become so intense as to be unbearable. In that sense non-euro members states are always at long-term risk of being pushed towards the euro – but Denmark and the UK do have that strong international treaty protection in the final analysis.Equally, it is true that the euro might fragment long before such pressures on members to join\u0026nbspre-emerge. It seemed perfectly possible that it would collapse a few years ago. Today the precarious Italian public finances and banking system represent a mortal danger to the euro system, as the Italian economy is far bigger than Greece, and “too big to save”.\u0026nbspSo, in the end, Esther McVey and her critics might both be proved equally wrong.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We must hold our nerve“Nothing has really changed, and it is still a bad deal so unable to vote for this. We must hold our nerve.”Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer\u0026nbspalso quickly responded to the legal advice on the prime minister’s Strasbourg agreement, tweeting a picture with\u0026nbspthe section that states that the “the legal risk remains unchanged” highlighted in green.Sir Keir said: “Attorney general confirms that there have been no significant changes to the withdrawal agreement despite the legal documents that were agreed last night.“The government’s strategy is now in tatters.”The prime minister reached an 11th-hour agreement with the European Union in Strasbourg late on Monday night and said she “passionately believed” it addressed concerns raised by MPs who feared the backstop would keep the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU indefinitely.At a\u0026nbspjoint press conference with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Ms May said the three new documents agreed provided the legal assurances critics had called for.They include a “legally binding joint instrument” relating to the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which the government states “reduces the risk that the UK could be deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely and commits the UK and EU to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020”.The second new document is a “unilateral declaration by the UK” which sets out “the sovereign action the UK would take to provide assurance that the backstop would only be applied temporarily”.The final document is a supplement to the political declaration “setting out commitments by the UK and the EU to expedite the negotiation and bringing into force of their future relationship”.Ms May needs to win over scores of Tory MPs if she is to have any hope of reversing the 230-vote defeat she suffered when the commons considered her Brexit deal in January.The DUP, whose 10 MPs prop up Mrs May’s administration, has pledged to carefully analyse the Brexit deal add-ons, though early signals from party insiders are not good for the PM.If she loses the vote tonight, MPs are set to vote in coming days\u0026nbspon whether to take a no-deal Brexit off the table and extend the Article 50 negotiating period.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This is both a question of legal interpretation and political interpretation.”But he acknowledged that the UK’s ability to end the backstop would rest on it proving “bad faith” by the EU – and ducked an opportunity to state a precedent for proving that in international law.Theresa May faces the Commons after securing changes to Brexit dealThis is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeBackstop not rewritten or \u0027undermined\u0027 by new agreement, says Irish PMMr Barclay said the agreement “reduces the risk” of being trapped in the backstop but did not eliminate it because “one has to prove bad faith”.“To say it eliminates it ignores the fact that one has to prove bad faith,” he told the Commons Brexit committee.Mr Barclay also fell back on arguing that “the starting point for this is that neither side wants to go into the backstop, there are safeguards to prevent it”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

India’s trade and commerce bureaucracy is the most mercantilist and outright protectionist in the world.”His article came as Theresa May rushed to Strasbourg on Monday to agree “legally binding” assurances with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.Ms May said the deal created an arbitration channel for any disputes on the Irish backstop, “entrenches in legally-binding form” existing commitments it will be temporary and binds the UK and EU to start work on replacing the backstop with other arrangements by December 2020.But in a hammer blow to\u0026nbspthe Ms May’s chances of forcing her new deal through Parliament, the attorney general on Tuesday morning\u0026nbspinsisted\u0026nbspthe UK could\u0026nbspstill be trapped in the Irish backstop\u0026nbspindefinitely.Mr Rudd, who was prime minister between 2007 and 2010, and again briefly in 2013,\u0026nbspcautioned a free-trade agreement with India was “the ultimate mirage constructed by the Brexiteers”.He described it as being “as credible as the ad they plastered on the side of that big red bus about the £350m Britain was allegedly paying to Brussels each week. Not”.Theresa May faces the Commons after securing changes to Brexit dealBackstop not rewritten or ‘undermined’ by new agreement, says Irish PMWhat do the changes to May’s Brexit deal mean and what happens next?The former prime minister also warned\u0026nbspBrexit will weaken the EU on the international stage, at a time when Donald Trump’s US administration is becoming\u0026nbspincreasingly isolationist and the West faces growing assertiveness from Russia and China.“The bottom line is that a European Union without Britain will be a weaker international actor than it has been, particularly if the European centre of political gravity increasingly moves in a more populist direction,” he wrote.\u0026nbsp“Without a strong Europe, the continuing idea of ‘the West’\u0026nbspbegins to look very weak indeed. And authoritarians around the world would like nothing more than a fully disembowelled West, no longer confident of what it actually stands for any more.”Mr Rudd called on Britain to “use this critical fortnight to start turning all this around”.“For Britain’s economic self-interest, as well as the wider political interests of the western community of nations, Britain should remain in the EU,” he said.He urged Labour and Conservative Remainers to unite to delay Brexit beyond 29 March, and said they should then support a second referendum to offer Britain “a clear, informed choice between two tangible, concrete proposals: either voting for Theresa May’s deal, or for Britain to remain in the Union”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He says he cannot accept the assertion that there is a minimal legal risk of being trapped in the backstop.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLike Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, they have sewed an apron of fig leaves, he says of the PM and her attorney general Geoffrey Cox.\u0026nbspHe adds: This deal has now reached the end of the road - if it is rejected tonight I hope it is put to bed.\u0026nbspJohnson adds the only route to leave with self respect is to leave on no-deal terms.Tory MP Ben Bradley, who voted against the government in January to oppose the Brexit deal, has today said he will vote for the revised plans.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe told the Press Association: We\u0027ve got the legal text and the attorney general\u0027s advice which makes it clear that the risk has reduced for being tied to something permanently, but it is not totally gone.The deal doesn\u0027t fulfil everything we\u0027ve asked for but we have to weigh things up with balance. To me, the reduced risk of being tied into something is preferable at this point to the ever increasing risk of delay or no Brexit at all.Parliament is determined to make this as difficult as possible and I\u0027m now at the stage where if we are going to leave on the 29th the only way that\u0027s going to happen is with this deal. I don\u0027t like it but we are going to have to play the ball where it lies as we speak and just get things done.I really fear for what could happen. It seems as though this won\u0027t pass tonight, or tomorrow when parliament may have to extend Article 50, which my constituents won\u0027t be happy with.The best course of action now is to pass the deal and leave, then we can think about the long term relationship and live to fight another day.European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen has said if the deal is rejected this evening, the prospect of a hard Brexit moved closer and his advice was fasten your seatbelt.He told reporters in Strasbourg: Depending on the vote in the Commons, we are either moving forward to orderly withdrawal or hard Brexit is closer again, more close than ever it has been.So, keep your hands on the wheel, look forward and fasten your seatbelt.The European Research Group of Eurosceptics Tories will meet at 5pm to decide how to vote on Theresa May\u0027s deal.\u0026nbspIt\u0026nbspwas widely expected that the group\u0027s MPs would vote against, but its chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, tells Sky News he has not fully made up his mind.\u0026nbspHe says: Unusually I haven’t yet made a decision...the only reason for voting for the deal is the fear that if the deal is voted down, that then we might not leave the EU.\u0026nbspThat would be the one thing that would change people’s minds, but I don’t think that is the case.\u0026nbspHe says ERG members need to decide if Ms May\u0027s threat that Brexit may not happen if her deal is rejected is\u0026nbspreal or\u0026nbspphantom, adding: My current view is that it is a phantom and it is safe to vote against her deal tonight\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn added: The unilateral statement is a weak Government trying to fool its own backbenchers because the EU has not even signed up to it.He continued: The Government is in real problems because they are trying to fool the people into somehow believing that somehow or other the deal she has offered is the only one that is available.It is not and they very well know that.The PM urged MPs to back the deal, saying: It was not this House that decided it was time for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, it was the British people.It falls to us here to implement their decision, their desire for change, their demand for a better, more open, more successful future for our country.Today is the day that we can begin to build that future.The PM added: Let us show what this House can achieve when we come together, let us demonstrate what politics is for.Let us prove beyond all doubt we believe democracy comes before party, faction or personal ambition.Ramsay McDonald was defeated by 166 votes in the House of Commons in 1924. Theresa May crushed that record in January with a 230-vote loss over her Brexit deal - the biggest parliamentary defeat ever for a British government.\u0026nbspUnless a significant number of MPs switch to back her deal this evening, she could be on course for the second biggest defeat in parliament.\u0026nbspAfter the DUP announced they would not be supporting the deal, shadow foreign\u0026nbspsecretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: The government will not get their deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament tonight.\u0026nbspThe only question is, how big will the defeat be?\u0026nbspTheresa May is now opening the Brexit debate - and she has almost completely lost her voice.\u0026nbspShe says if this deal is not passed tonight, then Brexit could be lost, or the country could end up with a no-deal scenario.\u0026nbspThe danger for those of us who want to have faith in the British public and deliver on their vote for Brexit, is that if this vote is not passed tonight, if this deal is not passed, then Brexit could be lost.\u0026nbspSpeaker John Bercow has not selected any amendments.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.After losing the vote in January, Ms May said she would head back to Brussels with the aim of reopening the withdrawal agreement, and securing legally binding changes to the Northern Irish backstop. So far, she has failed on both counts, with the EU 27 united in resistance to such efforts.\u0026nbspUnless the prime minister secures last-minute concessions this weekend, in an eleventh-hour dash to Brussels, many in Westminster expect the second “meaningful vote” to be resoundingly defeated too.\u0026nbspBritain does not want a long delay to Brexit saga, poll showsHowever, if parliament springs a surprise and her deal passes on Tuesday, Brexit will be secured – although\u0026nbspMs May would probably have to request a short extension to the Article 50 timeframe so that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspdebate and vote on key pieces of legislation that are required to be in place for exit day.\u0026nbspAssuming the prime minister does not win the day, the scale of defeat will be key.If it is similar\u0026nbspto January, it could be fatal for Ms May, who will undoubtedly face claims\u0026nbspthat she has wasted precious time in the last two months. Her deal will be considered dead.In this case, the prime minister would probably be out of options, and will be under considerable pressure to go down a softer Brexit route. This would risk\u0026nbspa potential\u0026nbspsplit in\u0026nbspher party while she seeks a majority for an alternative deal and effectively forms a parliamentary alliance\u0026nbspwith Jeremy Corbyn.Created with Sketch.

This would almost certainly require a short delay to the Brexit process.Mr Corbyn may also decide the time is opportune –\u0026nbspif Ms May loses badly –\u0026nbspto put down a second no-confidence motion in the government in an effort to force a general election, though\u0026nbspit still does not appear the Labour leader has the numbers in the Commons to win such a vote. \u0026nbspHe has also committed his party to backing an\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspon a second referendum, so this could also be the week in which MPs finally test whether there\u0026nbspis a majority for such a path. The consensus is that there is not, and it may be that proponents of a further public vote on Brexit do not test the Commons just yet.Votes on no-deal and Article 50 extensionCrucially, if the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote” on her deal, she has vowed to hold two further votes this week: one on a no-deal Brexit (due to take place on Wednesday), and a second an approving an extension to Article 50 and delaying Britain’s exit from the EU (Thursday). This is where there might be fireworks.EU accused of ‘playing games’ in last-ditch Brexit negotiationsBanks ‘broke agreement to suspend Brexit campaigning’ after Cox murderCorbyn tells May second defeat for her deal is ‘the end of the road’EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayPound falls after May warns of ‘moment of crisis’ over BrexitIt has been clear for some\u0026nbsptime that there is no majority in the House of Commons for a disorderly (or “cliff-edge”)\u0026nbspbreak from the bloc. As such, it is likely that MPs will vote to take a no-deal departure off the table.The following day there will be a vote on extending Article 50, and it is anticipated\u0026nbspthere will be a majority for this course of action.Ultimately, it is up to the EU 27 whether to grant any extension: if they agree,\u0026nbspterms and conditions might easily be attached. They could, for example, demand a lengthy extension rather than the\u0026nbsptwo-month period preferred at Westminster.Ms May will have to decide whether or not to give her own MPs\u0026nbspa free vote on the contentious issue of the no-deal scenario. It is an incredibly isive topic among Conservatives, and throughout the negotiations,\u0026nbspthe prime minister has deployed the threat of a no-deal outcome. \u0026nbspIf the prime minister decides not\u0026nbspto give Tory\u0026nbspMPs a free\u0026nbspvote, and whips them\u0026nbspto keep no deal on the table, it could easily lead to a significant number of ministerial resignations from the Remain-leaning figures at the top of government who would probably rebel.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister herself said, reject the deal and “no-one knows what will happen”\u0026nbspbut what we do know is that\u0026nbspMs May is about to enter one of the most dangerous weeks of her time in office.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Some Turkish and US intelligence officials, as well as US lawmakers, believe the killing could only have been ordered by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.The Saudi authorities, who launched an investigation,\u0026nbsphave repeatedly denied the prince’s involvement and instead have said\u0026nbsprogue Saudi officials were behind the gruesome death.Created with Sketch.

I want to help others who faced the same problems as me. When you make calls against the government you need help,” he added.\u0026nbspThe royal rebel is part of a wing of the royal family that has clashed with Mohammed bin Salman. He\u0026nbspsaid his own father and sister remain under house arrest in the country.Flight returns to airport after woman leaves her baby in the terminalSecurity concerns as Jared Kushner goes rogue in Saudi ArabiaTrump nominees for Saudi and Iraq ambassadors face grillingGoogle refuses to remove Saudi govt app that lets men track womenSaudi Arabia prepares to prosecute women’s rights activistsPrince Khaled\u0026nbsphad previously revealed to The Independent that he believes the Saudi authorities had planned to kidnap him just 10 days before Khashoggi disappeared in October. \u0026nbspIn eerily similar circumstances, the prince, whose mother is Egyptian,\u0026nbspclaimed he was promised a “large cheque” and millions of dollars if he agreed to fly to Egypt to meet regime officials at the Saudi consulate in Cairo.The prince refused, believing it to be a ruse to lure him back to Saudi Arabia, as part of an escalating crackdown orchestrated by Mohammed Bin\u0026nbspSalman to silence his critics.Saudi Arabia, under the de-facto leadership of Mohammed Bin\u0026nbspSalman, has faced\u0026nbspmounting\u0026nbspinternational criticism for its rights record amid accusations it had\u0026nbsprepeatedly drugged and extradited regime critics, including princes,\u0026nbspback to the country.\u0026nbspIn January a group of British MPs\u0026nbspcalled for access to a group of a dozen women’s rights activists who were arrested and reportedly tortured. They remain in captivity.\u0026nbspThis is despite the fact that Mohammed Bin\u0026nbspSalman has launched a high profile reform drive, including scrapping a controversial\u0026nbspdriving ban on female citizens.\u0026nbspApart from pushing for regime change in Saudi Arabia, Prince\u0026nbspKhaled\u0026nbspaims to support citizens who have fled injustice, torture and harm in Saudi Arabia, by helping them seek asylum in Germany and other European countries.\u0026nbspHe has now teamed up with Saudi activists across Europe\u0026nbspand enlisted the support of immigration lawyers and translators in Germany to create the\u0026nbspnetwork.It also hopes to cooperate with international media to highlight alleged attacks against Saudi citizens and will establish a commission to lobby for the release of those unjustly arrested within Saudi Arabia.\u0026nbsp“I am so far the only royal family member in this movement but I hope others will join me. Jamal Khashoggi is one of thousands\u0026nbspof citizens who have been killed unjustly. We want to rise up against his injustice to save the country from collapse,” he added.Prominent Saudi regime critic Abdul-Aziz Amoud, who has been based in Dublin since 2014,\u0026nbspjoined the movement after setting up an initiative in Ireland to protect vulnerable Saudi women fleeing abusive families in the country, where they are subject to controlling male\u0026nbspship laws.“The most important role of Saudi opposition outside of the country is to help others. And one of the most effective ways to make changes is through international pressure and helping asylum seekers,” he told The Independent.\u0026nbspI am so far the only royal family member in this movement but I hope others will join me“Women in particular are super-vulnerable. The Saudi authorities have repeatedly used their embassies to work against people, even in the case of domestic issues like Rahaf.” \u0026nbspEssen-based legal translator Dr Abdel-Salam Ismail is\u0026nbspamong those who will be a part of the team helping Saudis seek asylum.“Khaled has taken a very important step to break with the royal family in order to restore democratic freedom to the people of Saudi Arabia,” he told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“We will not only be engaging lawyers who are specialised in asylum cases but employing people to take care of things like bringing family members over and integration including applying for schools,” Dr Ismail said.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And he has consistently pointed out that the original dream that gave rise to it is under threat.It is exactly 30 years since Sir Tim submitted a paper to his colleagues at CERN, suggesting a way of sharing data across networks,\u0026nbspunder the title “Information Management: A Proposal”. The humble title belies the importance of what was contained inside, which included a complete sketch for the networked information system that would on to become the internet\u0026nbspwe know today.That would take some time, however. It would take a year-and-a-half for the name “WorldWideWeb” to be proposed, and it would take many months before the public could actually access a public version of the web even then, it didn’t look anything like the rudimentary graphical pages we associate with the early internet, let alone the huge and complex system you and your computer have navigated to get to this article.That modern web has brought with it a series of technologies that would have seemed impossible and unimaginable at the time the web was first being proposed:\u0026nbspinstant streaming of just about any film you would like to watch and\u0026nbspinternet connections inside of fridges. But it has also brought with it threats, some of which could undermine the very fabric of the web itself.In 2017, when the web turned 28, Sir Tim laid out what he saw as the three challenges that threatened it. All of them are at least as pressing then as they were two years ago, and some were eerily prescient about the ways the web would develop.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe first warning was that “we’ve lost control of our personal data”. He noted that many websites run on a business model that lets users have free content in exchange for their personal data, which allows them to harvest vast amounts of personal information, which in turn can make the internet a dangerous place to retain any kind of privacy or to discuss important but sensitive topics.Inventor of World Wide Web calls for crackdown on fake newsSince Sir Tim wrote that message, the world was rocked by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a whole host of other revelations about the amount of data being collected on private people and how it is being used.The second challenge he noted was that it is “too easy for misinformation to spread on the web”. Noting that “most people find news and information on the web through just a handful of social media sites and search engines”, he described how websites spreading hoaxes, and false stories can do so relatively easily, and that the system can be gamed to spread that even more quickly.Third, he said that online political advertising “needs transparency and understanding”. Such advertising is become incredibly sophisticated, he noted, and when combined with the vast amount of data companies like Facebook are tracking can make it very easy to manipulate those people who see it.The scandal over political advertising in events such as the 2016 election and the Brexit vote is still continuing, and campaigners still criticise the relatively limited transparency that has been introduced on platforms that claim to be looking to limit it.A year later, in 2018, he shared another set of challenges, which largely related to the fact that the world has crossed over the point where more people use the web than don’t. That brings a whole host of questions of access and openness, he suggested.The threats that are posed to the web still very much exist, he noted. “But I remain committed to making sure the web is a free, open, creative space — for everyone,” he wrote last year.By closing the digital ide and helping people get online, stopping the control of the web lying with a small number of very big companies, and by making the discussion around the future of the web more erse, he claimed those threats could be avoided.Sir Tim has been consistent in arguing that the web is really a communal endeavour – and calling on that community to help save it from the threats it is facing.“I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what it is today,” he wrote in 2017. “All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos, applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of millions of you around the world building our online community.”That was a vision that was present in the original proposals for the world wide web, begun 30 years ago today. There, Sir Tim described a vision of CERN staff on the web\u0026nbspas “several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And the final category calls for research to understand existing systems and model possible new ones or tweak those we already have.”A global debate is currently taking place over the need for increased regulation of online spaces, with the UK Government expected to publish a White Paper on the issue in the near future.The World Wide Web Foundation is currently developing what it calls a Contract for the Web, which aims to ensure access to the internet is recognised as a human right and is built for the public good.“You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit. Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right, we will need to come together as a global web community,” he said.Sir Tim said the Foundation was working with governments and other organisations on building the contract, but called on politicians and wider society to do more to help build a better web and ensure the contract was not a “list of quick fixes”.“Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online,” he said.“We need open web champions within government – civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web.“Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety. Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, ersity and security in mind.“And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart.“If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web, if we don’t do our part to foster constructive healthy conversations online, if we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agenda of our governments.”Sir Tim, who is due to appear at the Science Museum on Tuesday as part of the web’s anniversary celebrations, concludes by labelling the need to get the rest of the world online as “urgent”.“The fight for the web is one of the most important causes of our time. Today, half of the world is online. It is more urgent than ever to ensure the other half are not left behind offline, and that everyone contributes to a web that drives equality, opportunity and creativity,” he said.“The web is for everyone and collectively we hold the power to change it. It won’t be easy. But if we dream a little and work a lot, we can get the web we want.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If MPs vote to delay on March , Theresa May will be virtually powerless to refuse France’s demands. Why does Grieve still have the Tory whip And yet some Brexiteer MPs still think it’s safe to vote down the deal next Tuesday. That the law’s on their side. That we will still leave, but with No Deal.We would love to be proved wrong — but they seem dangerously delusional.Reject the deal, and a non-Brexit they will regret forever and which will destroy their party seems vastly more likely.Brexiteers will have made the biggest gamble of their lives and lost.THE Sun has always liked Prince Harry. But he needs to remember who he is — and stop talking out of his backside.It is not the job of the Royals, living an immensely privileged le on taxpayers’ money and goodwill, to preach vacuous politics to children.We don’t know, though we can guess, where Harry gets hollow profundities such as “every blade of grass, ray of sun and raindrop is crucial to our survival”. But at least that does no actual harm.Unlike telling kids the media “distorts the truth”, “tries to manipulate the power of positive thinking” and should be ignored. Or to imply the young generation are morally superior to those who, for example, fought the war or suffered the bleak economic hardships since.If he wants to be a social justice warrior regurgitating fashionable conspiracy theories and hippie banalities, so be it.But we can’t help feeling Harry and Meghan are riding for a fall.LABOUR, to its shame, is finally being investigated for illegal anti-Jewish racism by the very equalities body it once set up.Only the BNP merited a similar probe.The Equality and Human Rights ­Commission suspects Corbyn’s mob “discriminated against people because of ethnicity and religious beliefs”.Decent members will be horried, says Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.Indeed they will.

At this time, only four devices have been recovered.Police are now warning relevant businesses and sectors and the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious packages.They added no arrests have been made and Irish cops are also assisting Scotland Yard with the probe.Suspicious activity can be reported by calling the confidential phone line    or filling in a secure form at www.gov.uk act. If it is an emergency, dial .Security chiefs said last week they suspected the devices were a warning from IRA renegades ahead of Brexit and the possibility of a hard Irish border.They bore the hallmarks of IRA firebombs planted in London stores in the early s, which sparked blazes causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.The official threat of a UK mainland terror attack by dissident Republicans was ­lowered from substantial to moderate last year.But there are fears of a backlasha hard border ­between the Republic and Northern Ireland is re-established.If the group is found to be responsible for the packages, it will be the first Republican explosives found on the mainland since .One of the packages exploded into flames at Heathrow Airports Compass Centre - which houses the airports head office - at around .am last week.No-one was injured but the building was evacuated as a precaution and a terror investigation was launched.Officers were then called to reports of a suspicious package in the post room of Waterloo Station at around .am.The package had not been opened and specialist officers were called in to make the device safe.A third report of a suspicious package was then received from London City Airport at around .pm.The package was not opened and no-one was injured but staff were evacuated as a precaution.Then on March , eyewitnesses said students at Glasgow were screamed at to keep away! as police formed an exclusion zone around cleared buildings at the university.A controlled explosion was carried out by police with at least eight buildings evacuated after the package was found in a mailroom at around .am.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or timid David Gauke, or the destructively incompetent Chris Grayling.When rising Tory MP Johnny Mercer called for fresh Cabinet talent he meant himself. But he has a point. He, Kemi Badenoch, Tom Tugendhat, Tracey Crouch and James Cleverly — to name five — would do a far better job instantly.They have ideas, drive, an empathy with modern Britain and comparative youth. “We’ve selected too many of the wrong people over the last  years,” Mercer says.

But some MPs have at least behaved with honour.Our Government of Remainers negotiated ineptly. The EU, meanwhile, focused solely on ­forcing us to vote again. It has soured relations for a generation.Remainer MPs have been a disgrace, initially promising to respect the referendum then plotting to reverse it, openly colluding with Brussels against Britain.And next week comes the killer blow.Remainers from the Cabinet down will vote to end any chance of No Deal and to postpone Brexit, perhaps long enough for a second referendum — apparently unaware of the electoral catastropheThe rogue Speaker Bercow will help.Backbench Brexiteers, by contrast, stuck both to the logic of the Brexit result — leaving the single market, customs union and ECJ control — and the repeated promises politicians made toWe admire that.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal. If that works, she will at least be able to claim victory of a kind.It’s a long shot.

But especially Leave-backing Tories.Yet they are poised to reject a deal which, while very far from perfect, they would have gladly taken had it been offered up before the  referendum.They must think again.ONE thing unites many of Corbyn’s top team: they are rolling in inherited wealth.Take Laura Murray, one of the few self-styled enemies of “the bourgeoisie” who is descended from aristocracy and whose mother sold a Picasso for £million.Or millionaire Seumas Milne, whose papa ran the BBC and sent him to one of Britain’s priciest public schools.Or Corbyn himself, raised in a country manor and sent to prep school.Never having experienced poverty, these super-rich poseurs consider it romantic and noble rather than a trap to be escaped through opportunity.Their failed ideology would turn that poverty into squalor and early graves.But what would these phoney class warriors care  It will never touch them.WE welcome Sajid Javid stripping more terrorist brides of UK citizenship.They deserve nothing from the country they and their genocidal IS husbands swore to overthrow.

These include a fat embolism, when fat enters the bloodstream and blocks a blood vessel.In the lungs, for example, it blocks oxygen from entering the bloodstream, while in the brain it can cause a stroke – both can be fatal.Cheap overseas clinics are contributing to a rise in deaths from having the procedure, Prof Frame, a senior consultant surgeon at Springfield Hospital, Chelmsford, said.Last year a survey of  surgeons from across the world found  patients had died from a condition called a fat embolism - where the injected fat travels to other parts of the body that it shouldnt.Most of these deaths appear to have been caused by inappropriately qualied practitioners working in non-approved facilities, including homes and garages, he added.Other post-surgery problems, such as gangrene and sepsis, can also be fatal.Sarah Hemingway, representing Elite Aftercare at the inquest, told how the firm does not directly employ the surgeons themselves, and has no formal contract with the hospital involved in the surgery.But Mr Paige explained how the companys website claims to employ the best surgeons and nurses for procedures.The inquest also heard how Ms Cambridge had been asked to fill in a patient information anaesthesia form prior to travelling for the surgery, but no direct contact was made between Elite Aftercare and her GP.A provisional post-mortem examination had previously revealed that the mum died from a fat embolism caused by a cosmetic surgical procedure.It had been reported that the beautician had been paranoid about having excess stomach weight from having children, and opted for the butt lt procedure, which involves the reshaping of the buttocks by transferring fat from other areas including the stomach and back.Reports in the aftermath of her death told how Ms Cambridge had three heart attacks during the operation, which took place on August  last year.Patients make appointments at a UK office before travelling to Turkey for the surgery.The clinic’s website claims: “Elite Aftercare aims to provide a UK standard of care.”One reality star who had surgery there said last year: “It’s not a dodgy back street clinic.“I weighed up whether to have my nose job in the UK or over there and chose Turkey.“They’re constantly checking you’re all OK. They’re not going to discharge youthey don’t think you’re fit to leave the hospital. I was fine.”During Tuesdays hearing, the coroner suggested that a three-day inquest into her death would take place in early July, focusing on the contact between Ms Cambridge and Elite Aftercare, any pre-assessments done prior to the treatment, and the procedure itself.The controversial Brazilian butt lt, made famous by US reality TV star Kim Kardashian, involves taking fat from the waist or stomach and inserting it in the buttocks.The operation takes between one and two hours and involves a tiny cannula being inserted into a mm hole to extract fat.The fat is then puried and re-injected into the buttocks.According to Elite Aftercares website, Towie stars Lauren Goodger and Amber Dowding and Geordie Shore’s Chloe Ferry, have had procedures there.Former Spurs footballer Jamie OHara also had liposuction at the same Izmir clinic last year after piling on the pounds by scoffing junk food on Celebrity Big Brother."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000475422161.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"geoffrey cox brexit legal advice how affect vote","story":"Heres all we know about what Geoffrey Cox said about Brexit legal advice, and how it could affect the vote tonight.The Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC is a member of Theresa Mays Cabinet and the chief legal adviser to HM Government.Last night in Strasbourg, the PM worked until midnight to work out last-minute tweaks to the Irish backstop plan intended to allow the UK to exit European control.In a last-ditch bid to stave off Commons humiliation, an exhausted-sounding Mrs May told MPs today: If this vote is not passed tonight,this deal is not passed, Brexit may be lost.However, this morning, Geoffrey Cox torpedoed her chances of winning over rebel MPs - warning that the risk remains unchanged of the backstop lasting indefinitelytrade talks break down.He told MPs that changes secured by Mrs May reduce the risk that the UK could be trapped indefinitely in the backstop, but do not remove it altogether.The Attorney General said the Strasbourg agreements reduce the risk that the UK could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained in the backstopthe EU fails to show good faith in negotiating a trade deal to replace it.He also warned that the question of whether a satisfactory agreement on a future UK EU relationship can be reached remains a political judgement.And he said the legal risk remains unchanged that the UK may have no internationally lawful means of leaving the backstop without EU agreement.In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cox told MPs: There is no ultimate unilateral right out of this arrangement.

UKIP has polled at almost % for much of the decade and won the  European Elections. Their core purpose - their very reason to exist - is to ensure Britain leaves the EU. This was a big moment for them. Perhaps the party’s biggest moment since their referendum night victory. The tweet read: “PATRIOTS SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE” Those of you who are familiar with science fiction will be aware of alternate realities and parallel universes. They’re plot devices often invoked in order to liven up a franchise which is under threat of going stale. The characters you know and love are all present, but there’s a twist. Up is down, left is right. Some detail is dferent, with entertaining results. In Star Trek, you have the Mirror Universe, where Spock has a goatee and people eat Kelpians for lunch.   Marvel Comics has dozens of parallel worlds. In some of them, Spider-Man is a cartoon pig. Perhaps most famous is Back to the Future Part II, in which a tiny change to history makes Bf Tannen a billionaire and turns Hill Valley into Vegas on crack. Most people assume we live in the prime timeline - the one where everything is normal and as it should be. I have long suspected we are living in an alternate timeline. This is the Banter Timeline - where all the things that were supposed to happen don’t, and are replaced by the most objectively hilarious alternative. It was created when a bored London student in the mid-s said to a friend: “Wouldn’t it be funnythat posh blonde bloke off of Have I Got News For You was mayor of London ” And the universe said “Yes. Yes it would.”   “Tell you what, itd be a laughBrexit won, wouldnt it ” “Yeah, and how aboutDonald Trump had a hit TV show ” “The guy from Home Alone   Dream big, my dude. Let’s make him President of the United States.” “Amazing. Now, who’s the most entertaining person we can get to be leader of the Labour Party ” It’s certainly endearing that there are still people out there who believe Brexit is all going to be resolved with some kind of sensible deal, which sees Britain set sail as a buccaneering independent coastal nation. But we’re in the Banter Timeline. In the Banter Timeline, only the most darkly hilarious outcome is possible. Lets face it, weve already had the Attorney General yelling BOLLOCKS at prominent TV news anchors this morning, so I dont know why youd expect anything more sensible from the rest of the day. Of all the plausible outcomes of this evenings vote, Theresa May’s deal getting another embarrassing drubbing from MPs certainly has the most comedic potential. Beyond that, only the god of banter knows what delights are in store. Perhaps MPs will plump for no-deal in their vote tomorrow, plunging us into a Mad Max-style apocalypse, where all there is to eat is freeze dried fish from bags.   Or maybe the most banterric outcome is for MPs to block no-deal AND block an extension to Article  in upcoming votes, leaving us in some weird limbo state. Maybe the Queen will get involved. Maybe Jacob Rees-Mogg will be Prime Minister come June, and will have passed a law demanding a butler on every street corner by Christmas. But whatever the next step, we should probably give up on the idea of this all being sorted out in a calm, sensible fashion. Sorry everyone, that’s a dferent timeline.

The public will rightly be concerned that British airlines are refusing to take them out of service, after Sunday’s accident in Ethiopia and an earlier one off the coast of Indonesia. Safety should be paramount in the aviation industry, which is why international air accident investigators are anxious to discoverthe two crashes were a grim coincidence or evidence of a more widespread problem. We are not prejudging the inquiry’s outcome.   But when Ethiopia, Indonesia and China are among the nations grounding the jets, surely erring on the side of caution is the right choice. US manufacturer Boeing will have to co-operate fully and allow its performance records to be examined. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to people’s lives. Brexit caution Last throws of the dice are rarely as theatrical as Theresa May’s dash to Strasbourg for Brexit talks last night. She’s desperately searching for a solution that forces hardline Tories to start backing her bad deal. But our country will pay the price. The truth is that May’s poundbillion EU orce would be an expensive, avoidable disaster. MPs should hold their nerve, refuse to be panicked, reject her poor offering and vote for extra time to find an answer that is best for Britain.  A growing chorus of Tories are demanding that she quit, but May is prioritising her own position over the national interest. And that isn’t leadership – that’s putting herself first. Halt kne sales Stopping the sale of terrying “Rambo” knives – popular among some gang members – is a small but signicant step towards reducing street violence. We have consistently argued that there’s no single, simple answer to halting stabbings, but fewer weapons is surely part of the solution.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said that the legal position on the UK being able to leave the Irish backstop remains unchanged. It means that Mrs Mays deal is incredibly unlikely to pass when it goes for a vote in the House of Commons this evening. But this isnt the first time the top lawyer has put his foot in it, having once tried to claim p for milk and the money for the fridge to keep it in. Here is everything you need to know about the Attorney General. Who is Geoffrey Cox  Mr Cox, , was born in Wiltshire and before - and during - his political career he was a highly paid barrister - becoming a highly sought after QC. For years this made him one of the highest paid backbench MPs.   In  Mr Cox declared earnings of pound, from outside work. He was branded Tory Gandalf after speeches at Conservative conference last year on account of his soothing baritone. What is his role  Mr Cox is the Attorney General - meaning he is the governments top lawyer. It is one of the oldest positions in government, and historically the position used to represent the monarch in court. While this can still happen occasionally, with them appearing on behalf of the government, they are now head of the Government Legal Service.   But their most important job is providing legal advice to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. In this role, he is supposed to put aside his political views and give legal advice without prejudice. What did his advice on Theresa Mays deal say  In a brutal opinion Geoffrey Cox left the PMs deal in tatters. Mr Cox agreed the deal “reduces the risk” that the UK will be trapped indefinitely in a clause called the Irish backstop. But in a bombshell letter he said that the legal risk remains unchanged that, without some kind of agreement, the UK has no internationally lawful means of quitting the backstop.   It comes despite Mrs May boasting an th hour deal with EU chiefs in Strasbourg last night had addressed Tory Brexiteers concerns. Addressing MPs today, Mr Cox insisted this is not a matter of law and MPs must back the deal - but the damage was done. Has he done anything controversial  Oh yes. In  he found the time to submit four separate claims for p bottles of milk, all of which were refused by the MPs expenses watchdog. The MP also claimed pound for a fridge, because he needed somewhere to keep his milk.

This is eight times the average house price in England and Wales and almost four times as much as a typical home in London.   Savills, which is marketing the property, estimates a poundmillion overhaul could transform it into a stunning modern home worth around pound.million. Euan Rollo, from Savills’ Chiswick branch, said: I’ve worked in [this business] for over a decade and I’ve never come across a home as unmodernised as [the one in] Airedale Avenue. It has to be one of the last remaining opportunities to redevelop a home in one of West London’s most desirable streets and since launching [on Saturday] we have already received signicant interest and enquiries.

The royal pair greeted each other with a kiss on both cheeks as they arrived with their princes at the Commonwealth Day service yesterday held at Westminster Abbey.And the Fab Four put on a united front as they joined the Queen and other members of the Royal Family. According to body language expert and author Judi James although an air-kiss can be considered one of the most chilling greetings, it was not the case with mum-to-be Meghan and Kate. Here, she exclusively tellswhat the pairs body language is giving away about the way they feel. Kate and Meghan managed to pull a double air-kiss out of the bag to hopefully signal some open warmth and a suggestion that they really were pleased to see one another. An air-kiss can be one of the most chilling greetings when performed fashionista-stylebut with Kate instigating the kiss by stepping forward and leaning in there were subtle but telling after-touches from both women to make the greeting a little more meaningful. They lingered very slightly rather than springing apart and the arm-touches were prolonged, with Meghan even moving her hand slightly to make the gesture more emphatic.Meghan’s smile suggested genuine delight and happiness as she used very animated gestures to chat to Kate across their husbands and she used this same congruent-looking smile to chat to Prince Charles in a way that reminded us of their obvious closeness on her wedding day. While William and Harry applied a more cautious-looking approach to their body language rituals yesterday, echoing one another’s body language in a way that reminded us of their strong brotherly bonds while adopting a formal fig-leaf pose that can suggest a need for self-protection. As previously reported , the widely reported rt is claimed to have begun during a dress fitting for Princess Charlotte, where Meghan is said to have made the Duchess of Cambridge cry. However it recently emerged that Kate is reportedly throwing Meghan a second baby shower after missing out on the one in New York.The Duchess of Cambridge is said to be hosting the event in which Meghans glam squad and relatives will be on the guest list. Kate missed Meghans bash in the Big Apple. And it appears she is keen to get involved in celebrating the arrival of the new little royal, who will be a cousin to Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.A royal source told Us Weekly : “There is still going to be some sort of private baby-centric event for Meghan’s UK people, and Kate will host.“Her glam people and other relatives will be there. Not sureit’s a total baby ‘shower,’ but you could probably call it that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle spotted without engagement","story":"NewsMeghan Markle spotted without engagement ring - and fans think they know whyMeghan Markles ring finger was notably missing something very sparkly as she stepped out for events on MondayShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsMeghan Markle was spotted without her engagement ring on Monday \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEver since Prince Harry popped the question to Meghan Markle, her ring finger has been adored with dazzling diamonds from Princess Dianas personal collection. The -year-old has made no secret of her love for the expensive piece of jewellery, which could be worth up to pound,. She gushed over the ring, describing it as beautul and incredible and shes rarely been seen without it on. But on Monday, March  this changed, as the Duchess of Sussex was spotted wearing only her wedding band on her left hand.   Eagle-eyed royal fans noticed the missing engagement ring and began speculating where it could be - especially as she wore it to a  discussion at Kings College on International Womens Day last week. Reasonable explanations for this could be that shes having the ring cleaned or repaired for some reason. But many think its actually to do with a common pregnancy symptom. During the later stages of pregnancy, many women experience some swelling in their legs, ankles, feet and fingers.   Meghan is thought to be around seven months pregnant now, so it would make sense she was having trouble with swollen hands. Milli Hill, author of The Positive Birth Book, told Express that the swelling is caused by water retention and usually comes on gradually. She explained that it was nothing to be concerned about - unless it was sudden swelling, which can be a sign of pre-eclampsia, a condition which can cause complications for both the mother and baby.She added: Its certainly nothing to worry about but it does show our level of fascination with her royal pregnancy as she comes towards her due date. Lets hope she has a fantastic birth experience and influences more women to take an active role in their birth choices.   The Duchess and Prince Harry attended two events on Monday, the first a visit to Canada House where Meghan wore a stunning emerald green embellished Erdem coat and dress. This was followed by a Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey, for which the mum-to-be changed into a printed white dress by Victoria Beckham, which she paired with a white coat and hat. Also at the service were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and royal fans enjoyed seeing Kate and Meghan greet each other with kisses following recent rumours of a rt.

Images of the majestic mammal , known as F_MU, were taken by British photographer Will Burrard-Lucas at a national park in Tsavo, Kenya.Full-time snapper Will, , took the shots shortly before the ft elephant - whose tusks were estimated to be up to ft ins in- died peacefully of natural causes at more than  years old. Will, from Beaconsfield, Bucks, said: Tsavo is home to some of the last remaining big tuskers - elephants with tusks weighing in excess of st lbs [lbs] on each side. It is thought there are less of  of these elephants left on earth, and almost half of them are in Tsavo. When I first saw her I was awestruck, for she had the most amazing tusks I had ever seen.   If I hadnt looked upon her with my own eyes, I might not have believed that such an elephant could exist in our world. If there were a Queen of Elephants, it would surely have been her. When we first caught a glimpse of her she looked skinny and old but she strode forward with stately grace. Her tusks were so long that they scraped the ground in front of her. She was like a relic from a bygone era. Will spent days searching for the elephant, as the national park area she called her home was the size of Switzerland.   His photos show her drinking at waterholes, eating acacia tree branches and striding towards the camera. Will was able to capture intimate shots from below using a specially-concealed remote controlled camera buggy known as a BeetleCam, which he developed in  to capture close-up photos of potentially-dangerous African wildle. His images, first taken in partnership with Tsavo Trust in August , have now been released for the first time as they are set to feature in new book Land of Giants which document his experiences in the conservation area. Will added: We had been looking for this elephant for several days, but finding her in a vast wilderness the size of Switzerland had proven dficult.   We spotted her from the air and we were converging on her position. I had a feeling of great excitement mixed with anxiety that she may yet evade us in the thick vegetation. But over the bushes I caught a glimpse of an elephants back, so when she stepped out into the open seconds later I was speechless.Find out more about the elephant here ."},{"url":null,"title":"reggae listeners more open minded","story":"NewsReggae-listeners more open minded to trying new foods, fashions and booksCatherine Loveday of Westminster University believes adults exposed to a wide array of music at a young age are more likely to try new thingsShareCommentsByEmma Elsworthy:,  MAR NewsHeavy metal and soul music are least likely to contribute to a willingness to participate in anything new\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAdults who listened to reggae and classical music as children are more likely to be open to trying new foods, sports, fashions and books as they grow up, a leading psychologist has claimed. Catherine Loveday of Westminster University in London came to the conclusion after studying the results of O’s research of , adults into the extent to which music affects behaviour later on in le. She suggests adults who are exposed to a wide array of music during their formative years end up with a greater desire to broaden their social and culinary boundaries. Heavy metal and soul music are least likely to contribute to a willingness to participate in anything new. The research found more than a quarter of those whose parents regularly listened to reggae were open to trying new things, compared to one fth of those who were exposed to classical music.   However, by contrast just four per cent of adults who listened to heavy metal and soul at a young age said they are now open to being adventurous and experimental. Prof. Loveday, a music psychologist, said: “Music is a very fundamental way for parents to connect with their children so it is not surprising that musical tastes get passed on. ‘’But it is interesting to think that listening habits might also nurture open-mindedness and flexibility, as well as a yearning for live music. “We have known for a while that exposing young children to lots of new foods will help them to develop a more adventurous palate and it looks like the same thing might be true of music”.   The study also found the age at which people experience their first live gig also has a big impact on their attitudes to new activities. Children who went to their first gig aged between four and six years old are much more open to trying new things nowthan those who attended a musical festival or concert over the age of  . They are also more likely to want to attend regular gigs as they get older, with four in fiveof those going to gigs before seven wishing they could attend live music at least once a month now. Conversely only a thirdof those who waited until they were over  are keen to regularly attend live music events. Further to impacts on behaviour, the research also revealed that continuing to listen to this wide breath of music as we get older increasingly has less of an impact on our characteristics. In fact, the research revealed that after , interests in hearing new music genres is on the decline. People are most receptive to dferent genres and sounds between the ages of  and , with nearly halfin that age group saying they are now very happy to listen to the same music as their parents, after which they become less inclined to listen to new music. Range of music listened to when younger also has an impact on the music you’re most likely to listen to in later le. Those who listened to a erse range of music growing up, are most likely to listen to hip hop, drum and bass and reggae.   Nina Bibby of O said: “Music connects us on an emotional level so it’s perhaps no surprise to see that the music we listen to growing up shapes our approach and attitude to other aspects of our le. “There’s nothing quite like live music to make you feel alive and we want to encourage people to seize the moment and breathe it all in. ‘’The research was carried out by OnePoll as part of O’s Live Experiences campaign, which encourages consumers to ‘Breathe It All In’ by seizing the moment to watch their favourite music, artist or band.Through Priority Tickets our customers have access to over , live shows in more than  venues across the UK so there’s no better time to explore exciting new live experiences.

Millions of people from around the world watched the heartbreaking footage as Snoop was abandoned on the streets of Stoke-on-Trent shortly before Christmas. The pooch was seen chasing his former owners car as they pulled off into the distance leaving him with just his bed. Celebrities including namesake rapper Snoop Dogg offered to rehome the Staffie but the RSPCA said the pooch was suffering from separation anxiety after being left in the street. The RSPCA has now revealed Snoop has found a loving new home in rural Herefordshire with Laurence Squire, StokeonTrentLive reports. Laurence said: He is a fantastic dog and he settled in straightaway. As soon as he came into the house for the first time, he jumped on the sofa and it was as though he decided that was the space for him. He loves to lie on the back of the sofa andI put the fire on he will curl up in front of it.He loves being warm andhe can find his way into a bedroom, you’ll find him under the duvet with his head on the pillow.  With Laurence working from home, Snoop is now free to roam around a large garden area and the surrounding fields. He has also become a regular in the village pub. RSPCA spokeswoman Rachel Butler has revealed Snoop is loving his new le having battled with separation anxiety after being abandoned. She said: When I visited Snoop in his new home, I could tell straight away that he was in the right place - he and Laurence already have a strong bond and Snoop absolutely dotes on him.  She continued: In the days after his abandonment, Snoop was incredibly nervous and anxious, which is no surprise after what happened to him. But staff at Gonsal Farm worked really hard in building up his confidence and it really paid off. The change in Snoop is massive and we at the RSPCA are so incredibly proud of him. His story put into the spotlight the very sad reality of abandonments, something which the RSPCA deals with every day. He was dumped at Christmas, a time of year which we spend with our loved ones, so for something so unloving to happen to him was heartbreaking.

However,you happen to heavily pregnant AND a bridesmaid, chances are youre going to stick out regardless of how much you try to be a wallflower.Not that thats stopped one bride from venting about a member of her bridal party whom she felt was showing off her baby bump in those all-important wedding photos. Now, the bridesmaid has got the hump at the bride, as SHE feels she was trying to be made look fat, rather than glowy and pregnant.   Honestly, its like a law of physics that every wedding has to come with a dollop of drama.Ranting on Reddit , the newlywed said: I got married three weeks ago and one of my bridesmaids is about  months pregnant .Kates belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. The problems occurred in the time between the ceremony and the reception. The bride explained they had a photographer booked to take a few hours worth of professional photos with just the wedding party. A few hours seems like a long time, but moving on...   In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress . I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone . I had to remind her a few more times before wed finished taking the wedding party photos. Fast forward to ing from her honeymoon, and the bride started to suspect Kate was not happy with her. We usually talk every couple of days, she added.   I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is p****d at me because I was trying to make her look fat, not pregnant during the photos. Now Im annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. A number of women whod been pregnant themselves came forward to defend Kate. As someone who was very recently pregnant, I can tell you I posed with my hand on my bump in every picture I took. I put my hand in my bump when I went out in public.  Because it sucks being giant, and yes, you want people to know you are pregnant and not just huge. Posing like that is not trying to make it into a maternity shoot, unless she pulled the camera person aside and asked to take pictures of herself with her bump. She was just trying to feel halfway decent about herself in the pictures. Another mum agreed, adding: Putting your hand on your bump just shows that its a bump instead of letting the bottom of the skirt just flow and risk looking like some giant chfon covered cow.It echoes all the unpleasant backlash Meghan Markle got - and still gets - for having the audacity to cradle her bump.Its a perfectly normal pose for mums-to-be, not a bid to be the centre of attention.

Catherine Shaws body was discovered on Monday, a week after she was last seen leaving a hostel carrying a stray puppy. It is believed the -year-old, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had hiked from Eco Hotel Mayachik to the Nariz del Indio summit, overlooking Lake Atitlan, to watch the sunrise on March . After the search came to a tragic end, a preliminary police report claimed the Brit was found naked and had visible blows to her body and lacerations on her left leg. However a new statement from the Lucie Blackman Trust, which is supporting the family, said it believed foul play was probably not involved and the death was a tragic accident.   Miss Shaws jacket and trousers were found on the mountain shortly before her body was discovered near the village of San Juan La Laguna. Her body was found about ft from where the puppy was found on Friday, said Amy Farrow, an American woman involved in the search for Miss Shaw. Community leader Juan Mendoza said the trousers had been found at the Nariz del Indio summit. Mr Mendoza described the -year-old’s death as a crime and called on authorities to find those responsible. Police sources told local press they believed she had been murdered, although officially Guatemala’s PNC force said only it had launched a “criminal investigation” into the “deplorable incident.”  Miss Shaw was found naked near a popular mountain beauty spot called Nariz del Indio - Indian Nose in English - which is a two-hour hike from the hotel she was staying at and is regularly visited by backpackers who travel to the spot nearly ,ft above sea level to watch the sun come up. The peak of the mountain, where a lookout shack with wooden benches has been built which visitors can climb on top of to enjoy a panoramic view of Lake Atitlan, is the tip of the Indian nose and was considered a sacred site by the Mayans who would pray and conduct religious services. Mr Mendoza, revealing volunteers had found Miss Shaw’s body and another search team had found a pair of trousers believed to be the backpacker’s, said: “It’s terrible this type of thing happens in our area and we urge the authorities to investigate because these crimes stain the good name of our municipality.”  A preliminary police report, leaked to local press, said Miss Shaw was found “totally naked, face down and at first sight has visible blows to her body and lacerations on her left leg. A spokesman for Guatemala’s PNC police confirmed she had “several blows” but said the state of decomposition of her body meant it was not possible to confirm how the injuries had been caused at the scene of the find, and forensic experts would have to determine the cause of death. Guatemala’s Interior Ministry said in a statement after Miss Shaw’s body was found: “After several days of intense searching by police authorities, other institutions and volunteers for the missing British national, participating teams are being coordinated at the scene where her body has been found. “After  hours of an exhaustive search, the result is very regrettable and the Interior Ministry and police chiefs have immediately designated a team which will carry out the criminal investigation.  “This is to determine what has happened and who could be involved in this deplorable incident. Ms Farrow, who lives in the town where Miss Shaw was staying, said the body has been recovered by local authorities. She wrote on Facebook: “We are deeply saddened that it turned into a body recovery mission instead of a rescue. “When we set out to help find her we were hopeful to locate her alive.” She said teams of volunteers, local authorities, a helicopter, drones and search dogs were involved in the effort.  Ms Farrow wrote: “As horrible as it was, we were also relieved to at least know where she was. She was about  feet down from where reports of the puppy was found . She added: “Once the autopsy is conducted, we can determineit was a fall or foul play. “Given how concerned the locals and towns are it was very apparent this incident is pretty rare in beautul #lagoatitlan.” Miss Shaw disappeared in the early hours of March  after leaving Eco Hotel Mayachik clutching a puppy and leaving her mobile phone and passport behind in her room. The stray dog - shivering but alive - was found at the highest lookout of Indian Nose, near to the spot where her body was found, between am and am on Friday morning.  Ms Farrow wrote: We knew from friends that a nature lover spirit like Catherine would not have left the small dog alone. Miss Shaws distinctive woollen pink and cream jacket was found at the base of the hike and handed to police, and her trousers were later found at the summit. Her had been travelling in Guatemala for two weeks, having previously been in Mexico and Calornia, before she disappeared. She was travelling with a friend, who woke up on the morning of March  to find that she was missing. Before Miss Shaws body was found, her parents, Ann and Tarquin Shaw, had said they were desperately worried and her disappearance was unusual.  They said in a statement: She has always been really good about keeping in touch and informing us of her whereabouts and activities. So this is unusual behaviour which gives us great concern for her safety. Please help us to find her. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which is supporting Ms Shaws family, said on Monday evening that a body had been found which is believed to be Ms Shaws. In a statement it added: The Lucie Blackman Trust is saddened to announce that a body has been found in the search for Catherine Shaw. Formal identication has not taken place but the body is believed to be Catherine. Catherines family have been informed. Please respect their privacy at this dficult time. The charity said Ms Shaw had left the hotel in Mayachik, near San Pedro and San Juan, on March  at .am, but then ed at .am.  She then left again for the last time at .am, heading in the direction of the lake. The trust said that at this point she had a puppy with her but no other possessions. A hand drum, known as a hang, previously reported to be in Ms Shaws possession, was left behind and has been located, and she did not have a guitar with her when she left, the trust added. The search encountered many challenges including communication issues due to lack of power in the area. Friends had set up a Facebook page to help to coordinate the search efforts and raise funds to pay for a helicopter to join the hunt for her. A post on Monday evening read: Our diligent searchers have found Catherine Shaw’s body at the top of El Naudiz in San Juan La Laguna. The municipality, police, rescuers and volunteers have been searching the area since :am this morning. We appreciate everyone’s effort and help in bringing resolution to the situation. This is all the information we have at this time.

As a result plenty of pundits are making the Gers favourites to progress on their own patch this evening.However, McInnes insists nothing has changed as Aberdeen look to move a step closer to winning the Scottish Cup for the first time since .The Dons gaffer said: “The Scottish Cup is important and over the history of the club we haven’t won it as many times as we would have liked.“As a club we have not won it for a long time. In my time here we have been close.“We have reached semi-finals and a final but for us to achieve what we set out to do we will have to beat a strong Rangers in Glasgow.“The intention is to win the cup and nothing has changed just because we got a really dficult draw against Rangers.“People think we have missed our chance by being the better team at Pittodrie and not winning.“Just because the game is in Glasgow nothing has changed for us.“It will be two good teams going head to head and our intention is to put Rangers out and get through.“I want to win the Scottish Cup – but I don’t get too dispirited when we don’t.“The intention is to keep on going. We want it to be this year, butit isn’t we will try to win it next year.“Myself and my players know what we want and we have to set about the task of going in and doing it and hopefully we can.”Aberdeen head for Govan this evening following Saturday’s - draw with Celtic at Parkhead. It was a resolute defensive display from the Dons against the Premiership champions.McInnes is hoping his charges can deliver another showing of that ilk and keep another clean sheet against Rangers.The importance of shutting out Steven Gerrard’s side doesn’t need to be emphasised.Both victories for the Reds against the Gers this season have come when they have kept clean sheets – - at Ibrox in the league in December and by the same score in October’s League Cup semi-final.McInnes added: “When you play against good teams who like to dominate the ball like Celtic and Rangers you have to be smart with your work. You can’t give them too much space to operate because good players like space.“Both Celtic and Rangers have got good players with a lot of pace who can punish you.“If we had even resources we could go and take Celtic on and play in a certain way. But we have to find other ways to get our results and win a cup competition.“This game will be similar where we need to pick and choose our fights, be good defensively as a team but also have the courage and confidence to go and play and create chances.“We have scored against Rangers in every game we’ve played them this season, but like Celtic they’re not easy to score against.“The defensive part of the game on Saturday was good and not many teams go to Parkhead and keep a clean sheet.“The last three times we’ve gone there we’ve won -, lost - and drew -.“There’s been nothing in those games and it shows with the right concentration and enough determination you can get the desired results.”McInnes is hopeful of having wingers Gary Mackay-Steven and Niall McGinn available tonight.Both missed Saturday’s draw with Celtic, Mackay-Steven with a calf knock and McGinn with a hip problem."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

He was a former member of shinty#s South of Scotland area executive council and did a lot of work for the Referees’ Association.He was probably best known for his work with young players in Mid Argyll, organising qualying tournaments of the Aviemore Indoor Sixes tournament for many years. His work for that competition was recognised by the organisers when he was given a special award at Aviemore along with his friend Donnie MacKenzie of Lochaber.John helped reform Kilmory shinty club in the mid s along with Ian MacPhee, the late Kenny MacRae, Roddy Munro and Alex Campbell. He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella.

He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob sheilds make new recycling","story":"NewsBob Shields: Make new recycling system in South Ayrshire work for usNew leaflets needed to inform the publicShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a first glance at last week’s report on noisy bin men – I had to check out my calendar to make sure I wasn’t getting a month ahead of myself. Let’s face it, stories about a Mr Paine and some broken glass usually appear on April . But no – it really was only March ! Mr Paine’s issue is the emptying of his street’s bottle bins at am. On the morning of his first collection, he mistook the noise of breaking glass for a robber breaking into his house. “I was terried,” he said. And then added, “This is noise pollution and most of the street must have been up.” Well, I too have suffered Mr Paine’s ‘noise pollution’ - perhaps an even noisier version. Chez Shields is no stranger to a well chilled Petit Chablis washing down the foie gras before Eastenders. In fact, I’ve been known to pop a second cork just to recover from Eastenders! Based on Mr Paine’s video recording, the noise made by the emptying of my bottle bin is right up there - somewhere between a small public house and a decent sized restaurant. Andit wakes up my neighbours – I couldn’t give a Chateau Le Clos! On my street’s first collection, I didn’t wake up thinking I was being burgled. House-breakers don’t usually make enough noise to get “most of the street up”. I seem to remember thinking, “That’ll be the bin men . . .” and going back to sleep. And on the  days a year that the glass bins are emptied in “quiet, residential Masonhill”, I respectfully suggest Mr Paine does the same. After all, we’re talking about saving the world here . . . not saving an hour’s kip! Greenhouse gas emissions are asphyxiating the planet. Plastic bags are strangling dolphins and milk bottle caps are choking sea birds. Our little Earth is throttling itself. To be honest, I’d rather be concentrating on ten decades of industrial pollution than Mr Paine’s ten minutes of noise pollution. And meanwhile, still in bin land, South Ayrshire Council is blaming the public for the latest waste collection problems. I can see the point they’re making – but the word “contamination” is a bit strong for Mrs McGuffie putting Tiddle’s empty Whiskas can in the paper and cardboard bin. And the new recycling system is a little too new for the “red tag” bin police to be targeting offenders. By refusing to lt certain bins – South Ayrshire Council is tempting fate. I’ve heard reports of some people using a neighbour’s bin when their own bin is full and red tagged. I’m also told there are increasing incidences of household waste being stuffed in the street bins reserved for pedestrian litter. And stuck in the middle are the bin men themselves. One told me “If we red tag a bin – we get **** from the householder. If we take back a contaminated bin, we get **** from our supervisors. Basically, were in the **** no matter what we do!” My dear old mum used to use a lovely phrase – “There’s a place for everything . . . .and everything in its place”. That’s exactly how SAC’s new recycling system meant to work. But it’s going to take a little time and a little patience – on both sides. The info leaflets sent out to explain the new system were largely ignored or discarded - most people didn’t understand them. But with the new bins now rolled out – a back-up leaflet might help. “You’ve got your new bins – now here’s how to use them”. Rubbishing the new rubbish system isn’t going to make it go away. It’s here – let’s get on with making it work for ourselves, our neighbours and our community.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironment"},{"url":null,"title":"churches facing end era parish","story":"NewsChurches facing end of era as parish minister calls it a dayCrisis in Kirk conregationsShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email There’s no parish ministers round here, writes Edwin LawrenceThat’s the crisis facing Kirk congregations in Girvan and South Carrick. And it becomes reality with the imminent departure of Rev Richard Moffat from Girvan North Parish Church. The area – in the short term at least – will be dependent on the services of elderly retired ministers and lay readers. Mr Moffat has been a popular parish minister at Girvan North for five years. And he was due to become Moderator of the Presbytery of Ayr in April. But he is set to move to a new charge in Morayshire, to be closer to his daughter and her family. He will conduct his last Sunday service in Girvan North on March . Mr Moffat’s departure is the latest factor concentrating minds in the Church of Scotland. For Girvan South, linked with Barr and Dailly is currently without its minister. Popular Rev Ian McLachlan has been on sick leave for several months. And colleagues say he is unlikely toto full-time duties. Rev Stephen Ogston was parish minister at Ballantrae Colmonell from  until August, . But he moved on to Luce Valley Church, and no replacement has been found. The linked charge of Ballantrae St Colmon also takes in services at Barrhill and Glenapp. So communities right across Girvan and South Carrick no longer have a parish minister in their midst. And there is uncertaintly at how things will be resolved. One solution might be a union of the two Girvan churches. And that could leave Girvan North - with its -foot spire – as the last kirk in town. It would presumably also be used as a hub to minister to village churches. The Post understands there can be as few as six worshippers in Barr Parish Church on Sundays. This isn’t helped by Barr being last in the pecking order for services, after Girvan South and Dailly. So it’s virtually lunchtime before a Sunday service gets under way. A Presbytery of Ayr meeting was due in the Carrick Centre in Maybole on Tuesday this week.And the Post understands this will see Rev Ian Stirling Fisherton Kirkoswald appointed interim moderator at Girvan North. Locum minister will be retired minister Rev Edgar Ogston – father of Stephen – who livesin Girvan.The Post has spoken to kirk elders in Girvan who say they’re uncertain about the future. And a retired church minister suspects that the two Girvan churches will be required to amalgamate. He said: “Things are changing. We’ve been a clergy-centred church for  years. “But one positive thing we’re seeing is the rise of worship groups which are prompting people to think about their faith, without necessarily being preached at.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandAyrMoffatGirvan"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"first minister must act over","story":"NewsFirst Minister must act over Tarbolton landfill, says MSPThe South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsBrian Whittle MSP challenges the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than eight months after Tarbolton Landfill’s owners entered liquidation, MSP Brian Whittle has challenged the First Minister to act, writes Edwin Lawrence. The South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site. He said: “Since the landfill closed its gates, worries have been expressed about smells and also about contaminated water running off the site.” These would normally be dealt with by the site owner, so Mr Whittle took up the issue with both the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand the Scottish Government. However, in the absence of a clear answer on ultimate responsibility, he decided to raise it at Holyrood, during First Minister’s questions. In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:   “I am not able to give that information to Brian Whittle right now. “I undertake to raise the issue with the environment secretary and to come back to Brian Whittle as quickly as possible about our understanding of the lines of accountability and the action that the Scottish Government can take to try to reach a resolution of what certainly seems to be a deeply unsatisfactory situation. “I can understand that people in the local area will be very concerned about any prospect of contamination and it is absolutely necessary that all relevant agencies and organisations respond as quickly as possible.” Speaking afterwards, Brian Whittle MSP said: “The situation with the Tarbolton Landfill has been allowed to drag on for too long already. “Aside from the obvious concerns local residents have, it’s troubling that there doesn’t appear to be a clearly defined process for when the operator of a site like this is no longer able to carry out their duties to protect the surrounding environment. “I hope the First Minister will be able to provide some much needed clarity on this issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"holiday beach made rubble","story":"NewsThe holiday beach made of rubbleSilver strand is lined with brickShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsNo sand castles - but they can be made from brick.

Tons of rubbish, much of which originates from broken sea defences at Newton Shore, was removed. But just a few months on the prom is back to square one. Derek added: “A lot of people don’t even know Prestwick has a beach and that’s something we want to change. “We want to boost the number of attractions at the prom but that has to start with a high standard of beach.” A council spokesman said: “Our beaches are important for the local environment so the Prestwick beach cleaning project is scheduled to take place each year to ensure rubble is removed before the main beach season. “This year work will start towards the end of March, subject to weather conditions. “We will continue to work closely with the local community councils, the Friends of Prestwick Seafront and other community partners so that the amenity beach looks its best for the busy season.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwickAyrAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilReligion"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

He has a levitating sausage, which certainly creates a vision. Special guests circus star Michael Jordan and the ultraviolet specialties of Fantasie de la Nuit promise a thrilling -minute show. Tickets are between pound and pound and there are two shows – am and .pm. Sooty has celebrated his th birthday and Richard says he’s still as young as ever. Richard revealed: “This show is Sooty doing what he does best – magic. “So the Gaiety audience can expect to be saying ‘Izzy whizzy let’s get busy’ a great deal. “Sooty will be performing some amazing tricks including sawing a lady in half, floating a child from the audience and making it snow. “Sweep will be getting in the way with his own disastrous magic tricks most of which revolve around sausages.” He added: “Performing live is what we love most. Of course, making the television show is a lot of fun but Sooty has always been at his best in front of a live audience where he can make not only the children laugh, but all the adults too. Plus after each performance there is a chance for everybody to meet Sooty and it’s always such a pleasure to meet fans old and new.” Sooty and Sweep performed for Prince Charles for his th birthday. Richard added: “I think it was possibly the highlight of Sooty’s career. It was just an amazing experience to be there at the London Palladium at the request of Prince Charles. “It turns out that Sooty and Sweep have always been personal favourites of the Prince. We also received a lovely personal letter saying how much he had enjoyed Sooty and Sweep’s performance.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter 1949 play about europe","story":"Courier readers may be as amused as I was to discover at the commemorative exhibition in Aqualibrium that the winner of the first Kintyre Drama Festival, back in , was Highland Church Drama Club.The club won with a play entitled #Sad about Europe#.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents.

It raises more questions than answers in my opinion.”Officers had argued that continuing with the previously-approved phased increases would be “counter-productive” in terms of encouraging usage and generating income.They also stressed that the proposed .% increase would generate an additional £, against the £, under the initial pricing policy and steer the authority towards recovering some % of its costs.Councillors heard that while the new pricing policy had been successful in meeting income targets in recent years – with facility usage remaining comparable in   to the two preceding years – the latest review had identied a number of key areas where usage trends caused some concern.The current year’s membership sales have “signicantly reduced” by % with the only area of growth being membership types which restrict users to either ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ services for a reduced rate.Membership is also the only area where actual income is predicted to be less than the previous year – down by £,.From a business perspective, Cllr Colin Pike urged caution on the introduction of any increased charges which, he said, people would notice “instantly”.He commented: “We understand that we have to make money but you don’t do that by putting prices up.”Initiatives such as incentivising existing customers to bring along a friend or relative to an activity, he said, would boost user numbers and increase revenue.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The North-east is one of the areas for which Observatree has a shortage of volunteer surveyors.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate.

FACT: Scotland has a mandate to pursue independence.” Ignoring the obvious hood that the SNP is not Scotland and cannot speak for it, it is important to establishthe Scottish people – whom the SNP says are sovereign – have authorised a second referendum in pursuit of independence. It will, after all, be upon the back of any such mandate that denial of the legal process of a Section  order from Westminster will be turned into the mother of all grievances.The chronology for the SNP claim starts six years ago when, in January , David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membershiphe were to command a majority following the  general election. As the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the party published in June  a private member’s Bill to emphasise its intentions. It passed its first and second readings in the Commons but was stopped in the House of Lords.When the  Scottish independence referendum came along the following year, there could be no doubt in anyone’s mind that a referendum to leave the EU could take place and that it would be possible for the UK to vote to leave. Nor could there be any doubt that it would be an issue for the UK to decide as the member state – and so Scottish voters might take a dferent view from the rest of the UK electorate.Indeed, so likely was this scenario to become reality that during the independence referendum the Scottish Government warned Scottish voters that remaining in the UK could mean Scotland would leave the EU against their will. It was also clear during that referendum that, were Scots to choose independence, Scotland would leave the EU the same day that it left the UK – which was being suggested by the SNP would take place before the next general election. By the SNP’s own words, it is beyond challenge that the “circumstances” of the  referendum were that the SNP was willing to take Scotland out of the EU as a price for achieving independence, and that, were Scotland to remain in the UK, it might still leave the EU later, irrespective of how Scots voted. Scots voted to stay with the UK.Once the Conservatives’  general election victory arrived, it was announced that the promised referendum would take place in June  and would be a UK-wide decision.Nicola Sturgeon, by then First Minister, had the opportunity to put at the centre of her May  Holyrood election campaign a promise to hold a second independence referendum. Instead she relegated the idea as a priority, burying it on page  with the caveat there would need to be “a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will”.The Scottish public was by then getting fed-up with Sturgeon’s fixation with holding a second referendum and in May  she lost the SNP’s overall majority. The unionist parties won . per cent of the constituency vote. Together this meanteven her caveat was rejected – she had no moral or legal claim and no public mandate to hold a referendum.The next month the UK voted to leave the EU, but a majority of Scots preferred that the UK should stay. This has been claimed ever since as a “material change” of circumstances that justies the SNP Government demanding the authority to call a second independence referendum. Only it is no such thing.As I have explained above, the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with the majority of Scots opposed was already well known and foreseen the fact that it materialised was not therefore a change – the circumstance had always been there. Furthermore, the SNP had advocated the very same outcome as the price of Scottish independence two years before . The following June, we then had the  general election, by which time Sturgeon had gone on, and on, and on about a second referendum. The result was her party lost . per cent of votes and  MPs. There could be no doubt that with some . per cent of votes going to unionist parties the Scottish public was in no mood for another referendum – be it about Scotland in the UK or the UK in the EU. It is said there is a mandate because the Scottish Parliament passed a motion in favour of being able to hold a referendum, but MSPs voting for their own policies does not make it a mandate from the Scottish people.There is a way round the claims and counter-claims about the existence of a mandate for a second independence referendum. All Sturgeon has to do is go to the country. She can call time on her minority administration and hold fresh parliamentary elections to show once and for all that the Scottish people will not put up with being “dragged” out of the EU. Every party will need to state, for the avoidance of doubt,they will subsequently vote in Holyrood to call a referendum.If Sturgeon is then able to form a new administration, with or without the support of the Greens, she will have an unimpeachable claim that a Section  order to hold a legal referendum should be granted. Westminster would find it dficult to deny one in such circumstances. If Sturgeon is defeated then a new administration could be formed – but without the prospect of a referendum dominating every issue to the detriment of Scotland’s governance.So, what’s it to be, First Minister  Will you put your faith in your fellow Scots to back you ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit nicola sturgeon told she wasn t bright enough to understand may s deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s First Minister was told she #simply wasn#t bright enough to understand how good [Theresa May#s Brexit] deal was# in a meeting with the Prime Minister, MPs have heard.Scotland’s Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell told Westminster’s Scottish Affairs Committee the incident happened the last time he and Nicola Sturgeon met Ms May.Mr Russell said: “When I met the Prime Minister with the First Minister to discuss what we thought we might be discussing, and indeed this was what was being said publicly, we would discuss compromise positions.: Brexit: SNP slam May’s deal“What we actually heard was an explanation of why we simply weren’t bright enough to understand how good her deal was.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"411 000 resurfacing scheme for tully road","story":"A #, resurfacing scheme on the B Tully Road, Ballymena is due to get underway on Tuesday, March .The scheme which extends one kilometre from Moorfields Road junction to Ross Lane Junction, will deliver signicant improvements to both the structural integrity and surface of the road.

The school, which is still teaching children and young people the precise skill and technique of Irish dancing, was founded by Moya Connnolly who told the Andersonstown News that this year’s reunion is very much “a celebration of the school and friendships that were formed”.“Initially we had pupils from the circle of streets in the Andersonstown area,  pupils at the beginning, and we taught from the ages of four up to ,” she said.“The classes just grew and grew and spread down to Clonard. In  we formed a céilí club which enjoyed its own success as well.”Moya spoke of how the school travelled to showcases throughout Europe during the late ’s and ’s and recalls the Andersonstown News covering their trip to Brittany.“It was a great experience and I remember all those involved would have teas in each other houses for a contribution of p to raise funds to go, we would have sat and embroidered all the costumes as well.“The pupils don’t remember who won what, they remember the craic they had, that was the emphasis, the friendships that were formed, it was very much a family thing.”Moya said one of her pupils, John Ferris, is still teaching at the school today and extended a warm invitation to all to attend the reunion on June .“We still have to confirm a venue as we are waiting to see about numbers.

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

He closed it in  having found a daily two-hour wait on either side of the border checkpoints unmanageable.He said Brexit has already had an impact on northern trade, with the number of shoppers from across the border halving in the last year.“The fluctuation in Sterling is having a knock-on effect on people’s salaries so there are less coming south because it is costing them more,” he said.“We are all suffering to a degree. And certainly people are afraid – everyone is afraid. For the last six months business has been stagnant.”Green grocer Ronnie Duke has also done business in the town for the last three decades.He said northern trade has always been an important part of his livelihood.“We would have a lot of people from the north coming over to Ballyconnell,” he said.“Derrylin would consider Ballyconnell as one of the major towns in the area, so we would have a lot of footfall and a lot of business across the border. We would be dependent on the northern trade coming over.”Mr Duke, who owns Ronnies Fruit and Veg on main street, said local people were worried about reports of requiring green card insurance documents to drive on both sides of the border.“The concern with the border would be a lot of people talking about this green card and things like that – in case they may have to be stopped at the border and produce this green card,” he said.“At the moment at the border you can just drive through, there’s no restriction there whatsoever.“Putting up a hard border there would be a big problem for people who live in the area and it would affect the businesses in the area.”Retired Cavan County Council worker Phelim O’Rourke remembers the days when the Army used to patrol the frontier.“When the British soldiers were here and you were travelling north you were stopped and asked a lot of questions – where you were going, that kind of thing,” he said, standing beside a long unused customs station on the outskirts of town.“Thank be to God that has all stopped and I wouldn’t like to see that coming back.”“I hope this is not going to cause any trouble, with tourists or people going across doing their daily business.“I wouldn’t like to see the Troubles come back to the way they were before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland teen upskirter may have to face the teachers he targeted","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is driving us all towards a no-deal crash that would be catastrophic.“At this critical time, the DUP have a choice to make. It is time to put people’s jobs, livelihoods and peace first before selfish party political interests.”.pmSinn Fein’s deputy leader Michelle O’Neill claimed the Democratic Unionist Party is “hell bent” on pursuing a reckless and blinkered Brexit strategy that is “driving us all towards a no-deal catastrophe”.“The EU has shown considerable patience and a willingness to facilitate a Brexit agreement that enables Britain to leave the EU without creating a hard border in Ireland, or undermining the Good Friday Agreement,” she said.“The way to achieve that is through the Withdrawal Agreement and the ‘backstop’ contained within it.“There can be no deviation or diminution from that position.”pm\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Butcher Gerard Crowe said people are ‘afraid’ of the impact Brexit will have .pmBrexit uncertainty hangs like a dark cloud over many border communities in Ireland, local traders have warned.As Storm Gareth rolled in off the Atlantic on Tuesday, people on living on busy roads between Co Cavan and Co Fermanagh expressed concern that the future of the frontier remains unclear.Butcher Gerard Crowe, who has been trading in Ballyconnell, Co Cavan, for  years, used to own a second shop in Derrylin during the Troubles.

Parliament should do its job today and say no to the Prime Minister.”.pmMr Corbyn said: “If this deal narrowly scrapes through tonight, I don’t think it will, butit did, we believe the option should be to go back to the people for a confirmatory vote on it,that is the case, but we do not believe it should go through.”He said: “The Prime Minister set herself a series of objectives, she hasn’t met any of those objectives, she’s brought back exactly the same deal and expects us to vote on it again, I hope the House rejects it.”He added: “The Prime Minister is stuck in a groove that believes only her deal is the thing that should be voted on, she wasn’t listening to what we were saying or what was included in our letter, and that is really the problem. The documents in front of us offer no clarity and no certainty.”He went on: “It’s simply not good enough to vote for a blindfold Brexit, so we will vote against this deal tonight as I urge all members to do.”.pmGet real people.

It’s not a risk I would like to takeit is a real one.”Mr Rees-Mogg played down the prospect of Mrs May being forced out by a heavy defeat, saying: “If it is less than , the Prime Minister will be able to say she is making some progress, so I wouldn’t worry about the Prime Minister’s position.”.pm\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Many people demonstrated in wet conditions outside the Houses of Parliament .pmDowning Street said Theresa May remained “absolutely focused on winning” the vote on Tuesday night and insisted she was not preparing for a general election.A source said: “We are not preparing for and we do not want a general election.

We have listened.“The other week his proposals were rejected overwhelmingly by this House – why is he not listening ”Mr Corbyn replied he spent “a great deal of time listening to people” on the shop floor and in small businesses, and “they want some degree of certainty”, adding “her deal does not offer that degree of certainty at all”..pmMr Corbyn accused the Government of trying to “fool” its own backbenchers and the British people over its Brexit deal.He said: “The unilateral statement is a weak Government trying to fool its own backbenchers because the EU has not even signed up to it.”He continued: “The Government is in real problems because they are trying to fool the people into somehow believing that somehow or other the deal she has offered is the only one that is available.“It is not and they very well know that.”.pm Responding to Mrs May, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said “not a single word” of the Withdrawal Agreement had changed.He said: “After three months of running down the clock the Prime Minister has, despite very extensive delays, achieved not a single change to the Withdrawal Agreement – not one single word has changed.“In terms of the substance, literally nothing has changed … There is no unilateral exit mechanism, there is not time limit, there are no alternative arrangements.”.pmMrs May urged MPs to back the deal, saying: “It was not this House that decided it was time for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, it was the British people.“It falls to us here to implement their decision, their desire for change, their demand for a better, more open, more successful future for our country.“Today is the day that we can begin to build that future.”The PM added: “Let us show what this House can achieve when we come together, let us demonstrate what politics is for.“Let us prove beyond all doubt we believe democracy comes before party, faction or personal ambition.”She finished by saying: “The time has come to deliver on the instruction we were given. The time has come to back this deal and I commend this motion to the House.”.pmOn the political declaration, Mrs May said: “I’m sure we can all learn lessons from how we approach this first phase of the negotiations as we move onto the second.“For my part, I’ve no doubt that the Government does need to build a strong consensus in the House before we go onto negotiate the future relationship. Not least to ensure the process of ratication is smoother than that for the withdrawal agreement.“That’s why we’ve committed to give a much stronger and clearer role for this House, and for the other place during the next phase. Not just a consensus in parliament either, businesses, trade unions and civil society must all play a much bigger part contributing their expertise in a collective national effort to secure the very best future relationship with the EU.“That new approach will start with the withdrawal agreement Billthe deal passes tonight, notice of presentation will be given tomorrow and the Bill will be introduced on Thursday.”.pm\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Anti-Brexit supporters take part in a protest under heavy rain outside .pmWhen askedthe Irish Attorney General’s advice has changed, Ireland’s deputy leader Simon Coveney said that there are no changes to the backstop.“There are no changes to the backstop, what is signicant and dferent, and has legal effect, is around the reassurance of the temporary nature of backstop.“This is an insurance policy that nobody wants to use.”.pmDaniel Kawczynski, a member of the European Research Group, said: “We got the legal opinion from the Attorney General, which was not as strong as we had hoped for.“Then our independent  of legal experts in the ERG, the eight of them, have given us their opinion that those guarantees are not sufficient and not watertight, and now we hear that the DUP will not be supporting the deal.

And that’s the gamble we have to take –we don’t vote for this, what will happenthere is an extension of Article  ”.pmTheresa May said: “This is the moment and this is the time – time for us to come together, back this motion and get the deal done because only then can we get on with what we came here to do, what we were sent here to do.”The Prime Minister added: “We cannot serve our country by overturning a democratic decision of the British people.“We cannot serve by prolonging a debate the British people now wish to see settle.“And we cannot serve by refusing to compromise, reinforcing instead of healing the painful isions we see within our society and across our country.”.pmWhich is why @Anna_Soubry @sarahwollaston and I left the party - she has only ever been interested in working with the hard right of the party, putting them ahead of the country’s best interests. @TheIndGroup https:t.co UeecVLXDIv— Heidi Allen MPMarch , .pm A DUP source told the Press Association that the party’s  MPs will vote against Theresa May’s deal on Tuesday evening..pmSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “We welcome the progress the European commission and the British Government have made on the withdrawal agreement.“The SDLP welcomes the continued protection for the backstop and the recommitment to avoiding a hard border in Ireland.“We are hopeful that the deal passes tonight to ensure exiting without a deal is avoided.”.pmSNP MP Stephen Gethinstold Mrs May she will “lose tonight and lose badly”, which he said “will drag this place and jobs and businesses over the edge with that threat of a no-deal”.He said: “Is the responsible thing to do now not to seek that extension so we can get some kind of way out of this calamity ”Mrs May said MPs needed to “have faith with the British people” and support the deal..pmMrs May reeled off a list of “core elements” she said were delivered by the deal.She said: “It sends a message to the whole world about the sort of country the UK will be in the years and decades ahead … To our friends and allies who have long looked up to us as a beacon of pragmatism and decency and a message to those who do not share our values and whose interests erge from ours. It says this: the UK is a country that honours the democratic decisions taken by our people in referendums and in elections.”She added: “I believe that we should be delivering on the vote of the British people in , but I also believe it is important that we give businesses … the certainty for their future, and there is only one certaintywe do not pass this vote tonight, and that is that uncertainty will continue for our citizens and for our businesses.”She added: “We are a country where passionately-held views do not stop us from making compromises to achieve progress.

No legislation that puts them above the law and no deviation from the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House five years ago.\"Mr McCartney concluded: “These mechanisms need to be enacted and the Stormont House Agreement implemented as the only way to deal with the legacy issue.”"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxNVxcXC8xMVxcXC8xOTA3MzUxMVxcXC9TY3JlZW4tU2hvdC0yMDE1LTExLTE5LWF0LTcuMzQuNTAtYS5tLi5wbmdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9jYWNoZS5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJkY2VhM2ZkMzAzMDk3OTZiMWRmYTk3MjBiNzA5NTljMzI0ODBlMjk4In0=/screen-shot-2015-11-19-at-7-34-50-a-m.png","title":"winning numbers weeks derry city fc lotto draw","story":"Winning numbers in this weeks Derry City Football Lotto draw are - , , , .

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
