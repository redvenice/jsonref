Feeling rejected and confused, he walked twelve miles to return to the people he thought loved him most.But rather than being moved by his journey back to see them, the family still didn’t want Toby around. They took him to an animal shelter and asked for the cat to be put down.(Picture: SPCA of Wake County)Thankfully the shelter wasn’t ready to give up on the sweet kitty.They called the SPCA of Wake County, in North Carolina, and asked if they would be able to take Toby in and find him a new home. They said yes.(Picture: SPCA of Wake County)At the SPCA Toby was properly looked after and showered with love. Just a short while later, he found a new home, with two new owners who won’t reject him.He now lives in a home with one other cat friend and some humans, and has settled in rather nicely. He’s already found some cosy snoozing spots and jumped on his owners’ beds.Toby now has an Instagram, so if you’ve been moved by his story and are now heavily invested in his life (same), you can keep up with him over there.MORE: Why do I feel broody when I see cute animals?MORE: Cats keep bringing gifts to their beloved automatic feeder instead of their humanMORE: Cat village in Taiwan is home to more cats than it is humans"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_8233936.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"instagram stars not glamorous life leaves flat owing 5000 rent","story":"They’re the pictures that this instagram and YouTube star doesn’t want you to see.Kayla Jenkins, a beauty vlogger also known as Okaylaaa, is alleged to have left her flat while still owning thousands in unpaid rent.Her landlords, Paul and Paula Hopwood, revealed the state of the flat after she and her flatmate left.They said that there are make-up smears and dog mess in the flat along with animal urine on curtains, dog mess in a Tupperware box, and bin bags dumped in the garden.They said that some of the curtains had urine stains on them (Picture: Channel 5)Appearing on Bad Tenants Rogue Landlords, Paula said: ‘To just walk in and see that it had been completely wrecked was absolutely soul destroying.’She now fears that the mess left behind by the YouTube star – who denies the allegations – could cost her thousands of pounds.Her management team said that the couple ‘staged the dog mess in the container to make her look bad on TV.’She also claimed that her mum had cleaned the property for her when she left.They added that £9,500 was owed in rent, but because she was a co-tenant she only owed half of it and a payment of £1,950 had been made.Kayla’s management team said the dog faeces was put in a Tupperware box for dramatic effect (Picture: Channel 5)Kayla has more than 100,000 instagram followers and another 600,000 subscribers to her YouTube channel.However she said that she suffered from depression and was unable to work so her income dried up.Mr Hopwood said that they were not supposed to have pets in the home, but she had ‘five dogs, four cats, two budgies, two guinea pigs and three rabbits.’However, she claims that she only had one puppy and that her landlord knew about it.The Hopwoods managed to secure an eviction order at court.Rubbish was piled up in the back garden at the house (Picture: Channel 5)Paula said before they left the property: ‘It makes my blood boil.’Paul said: ‘She is in there, she’s making money in our house, using it as a film set for her videos and not paying her rent and there’s nothing we can do.’During a visit by police, an officer who went into the house told the Hopwoods that the property smelled ‘pungent’.Paula said: ‘To just walk in and see that it had been completely wrecked was absolutely soul-destroying.’Kayla’s management team said she fell into debt because she was unable to work due to depression (Picture: Okaylaaainstagram)‘Ugh the smell, it actually makes me feel like I’m going to be sick.’They now face the task of cleaning the property and repairing it ready for the next tenants.Kayla’s management team said she was ’embarrassed and sorry that she was unable to pay her rent’ adding she ‘could not help the fact that work opportunities dried up due to a bout of depression’."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/922197856-e1524222828917.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"maya jama issues apology dark skin b tweet not ok","story":"Maya has issued an apology Picture: GettyMaya Jama has issued an apology after an offensive tweet about dark-skinned women written by the star resurfaced.In April 2012, Maya tweeted: ‘”Dark skin bitches shaving their head expecting to look like Amber Rose, when really they end up looking like Micheal Jordan.” Looooooooool’.The tweet resurfaced this week – and now, the 23-year-old has broken her silence.She tweeted: ‘A tweet has been brought up from 2012 where I quoted an insensitive joke I saw a comedian say on my timeline.‘It was a stupid joke that I shouldn’t have made light of – especially because it’s offensive to a group of women who I know constantly deal with disrespect.‘My genuine and sincerest apologies go out, not just to dark skinned women but to ALL women.

It said caning remains a form of torture whether it is carried out in public or not.\u0027Torture is torture whether you do it in public, outside a mosque after Friday prayers, or inside a room, banning anyone from taking a picture,\u0027 said the group\u0027s Indonesia researcher, Andreas Harsono. \u0027It\u0027s still torture, it\u0027s still traumatizing.\u0027Human Rights Watch also appealed for Aceh to release four people arrested in March for same-sex conduct, who each face up to 100 lashes under the province\u0027s Islamic criminal code.Hundreds of people have been publicly caned since the punishment was introduced in Aceh in 2005.The heartwarming moment boyfriend gets Jetstar crew to call...A HUNDRED people die from drinking bootleg alcohol tainted...My Indonesian bride, the £3.5m con artist: Forte hotel...Share this articleThe province\u0027s implementation of Shariah law has become increasingly harsh and now also applies to non-Muslims. Last May, the province for the first time caned two men for gay sex after vigilantes broke into their home and handed them over to religious police.Footage of the men, both in their 20s, being caned dozens of times in front of a baying crowd galvanized international criticism of Shariah law in the province and was another blow to Indonesia\u0027s reputation for moderation following the imprisonment of the capital Jakarta\u0027s minority Christian governor for blaspheming Islam.Making the canings private was proposed in July last year after Yusuf met with President Joko \u0027Jokowi\u0027 Widodo amid concerns that tourism and investment could be affected.The last canings were on Feb. 27, when five people including two Christians convicted of gambling were punished in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh.A group of amorous couples and alleged sex workers were publicly whipped for breaking Islamic law in Indonesia\u0027s Aceh Friday, just a week after the province pledged to move the widely condemned practice indoors.Shocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeThieves steal \u0027DIY SOS\u0027 tools as Nick Knowles appeals for helpDisturbing moment man demonstrates to police how he beat childNail-biting CCTV shows schoolgirl hiding from gang behind low wallPrince\u0027s assistant enters pharmacy twice to fill prescriptionsDashcam video shows police urgently speeding to Prince\u0027s Estate\u0027Prince beat the s*** out of her\u0027 Sinead O\u0027Connor reveals allMotorist overtakes car already overtaking in dangerous manoeuvreFast and the Furious wannabe drivers almost cause serious accidents    The public punishments have garnered worldwide press coverage thanks to the prevalence of people filming the brutal ceremony          An Indonesian woman is caned for prostitution in the city in another brutal public punishment witnessed by hundreds of people in April 2018The province has formerly seen three men and five women -

She might have been a relative. \u0027It wasn\u0027t until I saw the news that I realised Dale had died. It\u0027s a shame as he seemed a nice man. I recognised him from the television\u0027. Former neighbours of Winton in Central London have paid their tributes to the TV star.\u0027I saw him a few weeks ago,\u0027 said a woman who lives on York Terrace East and declined to be identified.\u0027He was delightful, always very kind, but he hadn\u0027t been the same since Cilla (Black) died. Since then, he spent a lot more time in Florida.\u0027A man who lives opposite Winton\u0027s former residence said: \u0027He was a very nice man. Very agreeable and cheerful. He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew. Always in my heart.\u0027 It was signed \u0027Go Go\u0027. Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious.

He devoted his life to making everyone else happy, his friends, the public \u0026amp his godsons, even though he found it hard to be happy himself. I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn\u0027t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, \u0027I want to withdraw\u0027.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked \u0027what took you so long?\u0027 \u0026amp he said \u0027sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!\u0027In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner.

He has had some bad picks\u0027.In 2016 Dale  admitted he was too depressed to leave the house after a messy break-up with another man but never revealed publicly who he was dating.An only child, Dale\u0027s happy childhood ended when his father Gary collapsed and died on the day of his bar mitzvah when he was 13 and he came home aged 21 to find his mother Sheree had killed herself with a drug overdose in her bedroom. His own sudden death yesterday came just a month before his 63rd birthday and the 41st anniversary of his actress mother\u0027s suicide, which he admitted he \u0027never got over\u0027.Dale Winton dead at 62: This Morning causes OUTRAGE over...Dale Winton said he\u0027d \u0027had enough and didn\u0027t want to age\u0027:...\u0027I pray he has found peace\u0027: David Walliams leads tributes...Dale Winton: Tributes for Supermarket Sweep host who died...Davina McCall leads celebrity tributes to \u0027generous soul\u0027...Share this articleDale started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he \u0027wouldn\u0027t leave the house\u0027 because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.Not telling his mother was one of his great regrets.He told Ok Magazine in 2008: \u0027She heard me on the phone to my then boyfriend, who was very obviously gay, very camp.\u0027She said to me: \u0027I never want you to feel there\u0027s something you can\u0027t tell me, and I will never judge or discriminate\u0027.\u0027That was the point I should have gone: Mum, I\u0027ll tell you I\u0027m gay\u0027.     Dale failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral in 2015, sparking concerns about his health and he later admitted he couldn\u0027t leave the house    Dale Winton had an unlikely friendship with Liverpool and Scotland hard man Graeme Sounness and his wife KarenDale Winton had an unlikely friendship with Liverpool and Scotland hard man Graeme Sounness.The friends met in a London restaurant after Dale flirted with the former footballer\u0027s wife Karen.Dale shouted across to Mrs Souness \u0027You\u0027re gorgeous, you are\u0027 before turning to her husband and saying: \u0027And so are you\u0027.Graeme would later appear on his mockumentary  wedding to Nell McAndrew where he was Dale\u0027s best man and organised his stag do.Later explaining what their relationship was like Dale said: \u0027It\u0027s great. People always do a double take when I -camp-as-Christmas Dale - walk into a restaurant with the hard man of football and Karen. \u0027Having had so many hard knocks himself in life, Graeme is a brilliant people manager. \u0027And because he isn\u0027t in the same business as me he is able to bring a completely fresh perspective to my problems. I love asking him for advice\u0027.                                                      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/10/4B4F6DF800000578-0-image-m-49_1524130292624.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Charles replace mother head Commonwealth","story":"    Prince Charles dons a traditional feather headband for an Aboriginal welcome ceremony in AustraliaThe 53 men and women who gathered in the lavish state rooms at Buckingham Palace this week knew what was coming - the Royal family has been mounting a charm offensive for months, culminating in Prince Charles touring Australia in searing heat.He even wore a white feather head dress to meet tribal elders, although he refused to remove his shoes or shed his suit on the beach.The Queen has just opened the formal meeting of the Commonwealth Heads with a heart-felt plea for her eldest son to take over her role as their leader, declaring that it was her ‘sincere wish’ that they vote for Charles to succeed her. Should her wish be granted?This group of nations - from Canada to Cameroon, Australia to Antigua - is made up of countries and small islands which Britain inherited, conquered and used to advantage as we built an Empire.We used their people as slaves and cheap labour. We plundered their resources, dumped our convicts on their shores and took hundreds of years to belatedly allow them to claim independence.There’s a strong argument that- in the 21st century - the Commonwealth represents a paternalistic, outdated view of the world.The Queen tells world leaders that it is her \u0027sincere wish\u0027...Theresa May promises to introduce a ban on the sale of...Share this articleNevertheless, ever since the Queen took over as Head following the death of her father George VI, she has enchanted and beguiled the most republican of member states.Elizabeth made the Commonwealth her special project, travelling thousands of miles to visit the 53 territories and realms, and has shown huge compassion and understanding of the issues facing its disparate members.          Her majesty and the heir to the throne (pictured together) are followed out of the ballroom by the Duchess of Wales following today\u0027s Commonwealth summitNow, at 92 on Saturday, she’s anxious to step down, and gave up long-haul travel in 2013.Unlike most of the Commonwealth leaders, Elizabeth was born into immense privilege - she inherited wealth and far-flung places that have few ties to the United Kingdom.There are plenty of reasons why the Commonwealth should not work as a loose grouping of states - but amazingly, it continues to survive, providing a useful forum which draws countries together, rather than apart.Given that the British throne rules a diminishing number of Commonwealth nations - why should the next leader come from the House of Windsor?Would it not be fairer to let the Commonwealth Heads of Government hold a secret ballot and choose who should replace the Queen?The UK’s current immigration crisis - over the British subjects who arrived to work from the Caribbean as part of the ‘Windrush’ scheme, is an embarrassing disgrace during this week of Commonwealth ‘unity’.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe Windrush workers were invited to the UK to help rebuild Britain after the war, and are valued members of society. They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations, his life has been spent waiting on the sidelines, being indulged and spoilt, and his relationship with his children has only recently improved.His relationship with his former wife was disastrous. Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap?

Somewhere around 32,000ft, I heard a loud pop, as we all did. The flight attendants were in the aisle.   Needum was with his mother Julie and wife Stephanie at the press conference. They were on board the plane with him when the engine exploded and sent shrapnel through the passenger window next to Riordan who was sitting seven rows behind them. He fought tears as he told of the moments leading up to the emergency and stopped when he got to that point in the story          Needum, a trained firefighter and EMT, rushed to help ranch hand Tim McGinty who was trying to bring Riordan\u0027s body back into the aircraft. He said McGinty was his \u0027back up\u0027 on the flight and that he was a \u0027big guy\u0027\u0027I immediately looked to them and turned back around and the oxygen masks were deployed,\u0027 he said. Needum was sitting next to his father and his eight-year-old son was by the window.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, neck and torso. She is pictured with her husband MichaelThey all got their masks on and he turned to look at his wife, mother and five-year-old daughter who were sitting directly across the aisle to ensure they too were safe. Before he went back to help Riordan, he tried to help a young mother who was sitting behind his wife with her six-month-old daughter. She was struggling to put the baby\u0027s oxygen mask on and Needum wanted to help her. \u0027I sat back down and looked across the aisle to my wife after we heard some commotion in the rear of the plane. \u0027I looked at my wife, looked in her eyes, and she gave me the approval to go back there,\u0027 he said.  Like McGinty and Phillips, both of whom were hailed heroes for their efforts on board the flight, Needum said he did \u0027what anyone else would do.\u0027 \u0027I felt moved to act and as well as other people on that plane,\u0027 he said.           This harrowing image taken before the plane made its emergency landing shows the state of the exploded engine           \u0027She made a point of speaking to everyone\u0027: Pilot Tammie Jo Shults spoke to every passenger on the flight after making her emergency landing. She is seen speaking to Timothy Bourman in a picture his wife shared on Thursday           Hero: Shults, 56, is seen getting off the plane after all of the passengers had disembarked. She has been praised for her \u0027nerves of steel\u0027 during the catastrophe           Shults is pictured in 1988.

Southwest is a great company and they took really good care of us.                             God put us on that plane for a reason. Everybody acted and everybody stayed strong                         \u0027There\u0027s no question in my mind as to who I\u0027ll be flying with again but they really took care of us. \u0027God put people on that plane for a reason. Everybody acted and everybody stood strong,\u0027 he said.Once the plane had landed in Philadelphia, Shults \u0027made a point\u0027 of speaking to every single passenger on board to comfort them before they disembarked, Needum\u0027s wife Stephanie said. She paid special attention to the children, including their five-year-old daughter. \u0027She took the time to stop and talk to our daughter and she was very good to her, they had small talk about the oxygen mask which, as a five-year-old was what she was most interested in, and she reassured her that in her 32 years of flying that her oxygen masks had never come down so she told our daughter that she was special to try to make it a positive.          Needum and his wife Stephanie (above together) were in New York City with his parents and their son and daughter for a family vacation. They were on their way home to Texas when the engine exploded on the Southwest Airlines flight          Needum said retired nurse Peggy Phillips (shown above with McGinty once they had landed back in Dallas hours later) was a \u0027special lady\u0027 \u0027She comforted everybody. She did amazing, she is an amazing person,\u0027 Stephanie Needum said.  The couple\u0027s children were \u0027shaken\u0027 by the ordeal but are back at school with their friends, they said. Riordan\u0027s immediate family have been too distraught to speak at length. On Wednesday, her sister-in-law thanked Needum and McGinty for bringing her back into the aircraft because now they would be able to have closure with a proper burial.Investigators are still looking into what caused the engine failure. They have so far been able to determine that a fan blade separated as a result of metal fatigue at the hub and that it may have contributed to the malfunction.The Boeing 737-700 was tested three days before the flight.            This was the Row 14 seat which Riordan was sitting in when she was sucked towards the window at 32,00ft           Riordan\u0027s window was smashed by shrapnel from the exploding engine which was several rows in front of her and in fact, was directly beside the Needum family in Row 7"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/12/4B4FC53000000578-0-image-m-7_1524135710143.jpg","title":"Tory Remain MPs force Commons vote EU customs union","story":"Treasury Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan (left), Health Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston (right) and former minister Bob Neill joined forces with opposition MPs to secure the backbench business debateMrs May has insisted Britain will leave the EU\u0027s customs union after Brexit to ensure it can sign trade deals with the rest of the world.

In November, students in Sussex, Bristol, Leicester, Manchester and London all took part in protests demanding an end to Prevent. It was part of a tour of campuses organised by the NUS.A previous tour in 2015 included events campaigning against Prevent at Birmingham, Glasgow and Swansea universities.Terrorism expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said the protest targeting Mr Kaplan was ‘totally unacceptable behaviour’. Prevent is ‘not an obligation on lecturers to spy on students’, he said, adding that staff ‘have a duty of care … to prevent them being drawn into extremism’.‘The hounding of this man is unacceptable and inconsistent with what should go on in a university.’ Westminster University said it supports students’ rights to make their voices heard through peaceful protest, but a spokesman added: ‘The university condemns the public naming of a member of our staff and the calls for his removal.’A Soas spokesman said its approach to Prevent was primarily ‘safeguarding the welfare our students and staff’ but that this is ‘balanced against our fundamental commitment to academic freedom’.Mr Olatunji said: ‘Students from different universities and a wide range of student groups organised independently and protested against the implementation of the widely discredited Prevent duty at the University of Westminster.‘Yusuf Kaplan has been identified as a key figurehead in pushing for draconian implementation of this policy … The protest was intended to disrupt actions at the university and push for increased transparency … which it has successfully done.’Miss Koutteineh did not respond to requests for comment.  Poor, little rich kids who spout hatredMIDDLE CLASS CHEERLEADER FOR TERRORIST GROUPSFarah Koutteineh, an international relations student at Westminster University orchestrated the campaign demanding the sacking of Yusuf Kaplan.

The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested  There could be little doubt about the prevailing view among the members as they assembled at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning for the opening ceremony of the largest Commonwealth summit in the organisation\u0027s history.It came despite reports claiming that some Commonwealth leaders remain \u0027underwhelmed\u0027 by the Prince of Wales, while senior Labour figures, including leader Jeremy Corbyn, have questioned whether he should be honoured with the role.It fell to the Maltese prime minister, as the Commonwealth\u0027s outgoing chair-in-office, to speak on behalf of his colleagues.\u0027We are elated by the vigour with which the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs,\u0027 said Dr Joseph Muscat. \u0027We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0027It remains to be seen whether the leaders decide to formalise this intention in today\u0027s end-of-summit communique. Since there is no constitutional rule about the headship, there is no requirement to do so.And although there is no vacancy yet, this was still a landmark moment. The prince has been quietly assuming more and more of the monarch\u0027s duties – investitures, overseas tours and, most recently, honouring the fallen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.           The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things But the Commonwealth question has always been studiously avoided. The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested.Yet having visited 44 of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth (he has been to ten in the past year alone) and having known all its leaders since birth, he probably understands \u0027the club\u0027 better than anyone alive, with the exception of his parents.Yesterday he spoke fondly of what has been \u0027a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\u0027 and of bygone Commonwealth statesmen such as Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada, and Jomo Kenyatta, former president of Kenya. Both men\u0027s sons – Justin Trudeau and Uhuru Kenyatta – have since followed their fathers into politics. Both of them were seated on the stage yesterday with the other premiers. The Windsors are certainly not the only Commonwealth dynasty.The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things.Over nearly seven decades she has held this argumentative organisation-cum-clan together, listening to their troubles in endless private audiences, wining and dining them, breaking up fights and generally keeping the show on the road.But this was the nearest she has ever come to an instruction.Cleverly, she talked of the prince continuing her father\u0027s work as well as her own.  The Queen has told foreign dignitaries of her \u0027sincere wish\u0027 that they pick Prince Charles to take over as leader of the Commonwealth during a large summit at Buckingham Palace Commonwealth summits are unlike any other, not least because there are no interpreters. The family atmosphere was evident even before the start yesterday as the leaders gathered in the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.Usually, royal guests in the state apartments stand around nervously, trying not to touch anything. This lot swaggered in, many giving each other bear hugs, and cheerfully plonked themselves down on priceless sofas and chairs, making themselves thoroughly at home.It is one of the reasons why the Queen has always enjoyed these summits, and why there was an added poignancy to yesterday\u0027s proceedings. For this was a farewell of sorts – not that anyone put it quite like that.The Queen, who celebrates her 92nd birthday tomorrow, no longer undertakes long-haul travel. These Commonwealth summits, held every other year, take place in Britain only every 20 years or so. The next one is scheduled for Malaysia, and the Prince of Wales will represent the Queen there.She will continue to play an active part in Commonwealth affairs and meet its leaders when they are in Britain. But her days of far-away summits are over.It explains why this gathering had attracted the largest number of premiers in Commonwealth history, with 47 heads of government present among 53 delegations.She attended her first gathering of its leaders as a princess, when her father, King George VI, created the modern organisation out of the remnants of the British Empire. There were only eight members of the Commonwealth when the Queen came to the throne.          Britain\u0027s Prince Charles greets India\u0027s Prime Narendra Modi in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner on Thursday night In 1953, she was the dazzling debutante head surrounded by grand old stagers like Churchill, Menzies and Nehru. She would entertain the Commonwealth prime ministers on their annual trips to London until they decided to rotate these gatherings among the member nations. In 1971 the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or CHOGM) took place in Singapore.Prime Minister Edward Heath formally advised the Queen not to attend. He warned that there would be a row over British arms sales to South Africa and that there would be a toxic atmosphere – as indeed there was. The Commonwealth came close to imploding there and then.The Queen was adamant that she would never miss another one. She has been turning up ever since, holding her audiences, her banquets and her receptions (with the exception of 2013, when the new long-haul ban ruled out a journey to Sri Lanka). All through the 1970s and 80s, all through the bust-ups over Rhodesia and South Africa, she was there in the wings, defusing the tension, raising the tone, nudging the organisation towards consensus rather than polarisation.Along the way, the Commonwealth would enjoy great triumphs – notably the end of apartheid, the return of South Africa to \u0027the club\u0027 and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe fact that dozens of ex-colonies have maintained such a close bond with the once-loathed ex-imperial Crown has been, in no small part, down to the way the Queen has personally reframed that relationship.In recent years, the Commonwealth may have lost its way at a political level, eclipsed by a myriad of grander, flashier copycats – the G20, the EU and so on. Its critics suggest it is an outdated, clapped-out post-imperial has-been. But it still does its best work at the people-to-people level through numerous grass-roots associations, plugging away on tiny budgets.It has plenty of admirers and jealous rivals. The French have done their best to emulate it. There are many nations who want to join.This is a unique outfit with a unique character, forged through shared bonds of history, language, law and sacrifice. Last night\u0027s dinner was proof of that. State banquets at the Palace always have a U-shaped table with the Queen at the top. Not this one.     Last night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt Missing his Markle: Harry and William join the Queen as she...British fishing firm can appeal against a controversial...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...King of Swaziland renames the country Kingdom of eSwatini to...Share this articleLast night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt. She sat between Dr Muscat of Malta and president Adama Barrow of The Gambia (now a Commonwealth member once more, having recently ejected the madman who used to be in charge).All the Royal Family were there, with the exception of a convalescing Prince Philip and a heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Spread all around the Picture Gallery was that old ex-imperial family to which the Queen pledged herself on her 21st birthday.By tradition, a summit newcomer had been invited to raise the toast to the Queen at the black tie banquet. President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana struck a somewhat melancholy note as he expressed \u0027our collective regret that she will no longer automatically be present at our proceedings\u0027.But he voiced a \u0027fervent hope\u0027 that \u0027her deep love for this association will continue to light the way for all of us\u0027. The party is far from over, however.Today this lot head for their summit \u0027retreat\u0027 at Windsor Castle – where the Queen will have a more intimate lunchtime bash for them.

One in five admit they speed for the thrill of driving so quickly.Rob Miles, director of car insurance at Direct Line said: \u0027Speeding is one of the biggest causes of accidents and casualties on UK roads. The research suggests that it is often not deliberate, as drivers may be unaware that they may are creeping above the limit. However, speed limits are set for a reason and 20mph and 30mph zones are often around schools, hospitals and other highly pedestrianised zones, where going over the limit could prove fatal in the event of an accident.\u0027The findings come amid calls from a senior police officer to get rid of the 10 per cent \u0027buffer\u0027 over the signposted limit that most police forces allow.          Millions believe there are \u0027acceptable\u0027 upper speeds they can drive at above the limitThey are typically given another 2mph allowance above this level.This leeway, which also applies to those caught on camera, is equivalent to being allowed to travel at 68mph in a 60mph zone or 35 mph in a 30mph zone.But earlier this year the chief constable of West Mercia police force Anthony Bangham said the days of the \u0027soft\u0027 treatment of offenders must come to an end.Mr Bangham, who is the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council lead on road policy, sparked a backlash from motoring campaigners and MPs for appearing to suggest that drivers should be given a ticket for travelling just 1mph over the speed limit.Mr Bangham quickly backtracked and said his comments had been misunderstood.EXCLUSIVE: Black man arrested in Starbucks was a repeat...Driver jailed for 12 years for running over pedestrian\u0027s...\u0027Ain\u0027t nobody got time for this!\u0027 911 operator is jailed for...Share this articleAnthony Bangham admitted punishing drivers for straying just one mph over the limit would not be \u0027proportionate or achievable\u0027.But speeding remains a huge problem.The equivalent of four people a minute were caught speeding in 2016, according to figures from the Home Office.In 2016 a total of 1.97 million fixed penalty notices were issued for speed limit offences across England and Wales, an extra 25,000 compared to 2015 and 107,000 compared to 2014.The most recent figures available from the Department for Transport show there were 1,792 road deaths reported in 2016 - up 4 per cent from 2015 and the highest annual total since 2011. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/01/4B558DA000000578-0-image-m-50_1524183195220.jpg","title":"UK proposals Irish border Brexit rejected Brussels report","story":"Exclusive: EU rejects Theresa May\u0027s Brexit Irish border solution as doubts grow over whether UK can leave customs union"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/16/4B48725F00000578-0-image-a-8_1524066130829.jpg","title":"Deliveroo effect seen Brits splurge takeaways soar 73 CENT","story":"    The \u0027Deliveroo-effect\u0027 has seen a 73per cent surge in the money spent on home delivery of takeaways in 10 years, taking the figure to £4.2billion (file photo)There were some 673million deliveries in the past year, which is equivalent to ten for every person in the country, according to research by market analysts at the NPD Group.Chinese was the most popular at 179 million, ahead of pizza at 171m, burgers at 82m and curry at 70m.Pizza\u0027s share of the market is falling while the home delivery of burgers is rising rapidly, led by the fact that even McDonald\u0027s now has a tie-up with delivery firms.McDonald\u0027s refused to serve paramedics on the night shift...Sainsbury\u0027s DROP Classic Coke from its £3 meal deal blaming...Share this articleNPD said there were 60per cent more home deliveries of burgers in 2017 than in 2016.

You must be stupid\u0027. Canny, 33, a commodities broker from Essex, told MailOnline after the incident: \u0027Of course I\u0027d do it again. If it happened again tonight, I\u0027d do the same thing again and I wouldn\u0027t even think about it.\u0027He added: \u0027Why should I allow people to break into my property and damage my vehicle? Where I come from, that\u0027s not acceptable.\u0027I\u0027m absolutely not having someone rob my car with me sitting upstairs. If I\u0027m out and it happens, there\u0027s nothing I can do about it.

There were about 20 people watching in the end.\u0027 Before targeting the investment banker, de Silva and a pal stole over £1,000 in goods in thefts from Chelsea and Fulham residents earlier that night.          Former amateur rugby player Stephen Canny tackled the robbers in a pair of pyjama shortsOn Ellerby Street, Fulham, de Silva robbed lawyer Stephen Wisking and stole a Dell Laptop, an Apple iPad Pro, £100 euros, a blue canvas bags containing paperwork and another black bag from his BMW X5.He went on to Roskell Road, Putney, and stole Bose headphones and a red bag containing books and documents belonging to William Bond.In a third robbery at Beaufort Street, in Chelsea, he stole from Ashley Fromberg a black holdall and ID documents.The two Mercedes belonging to Stephen Canny and his girlfriend were the thieves\u0027 fourth target.He pinned de Silva onto the ground opposite Gordon Ramsay\u0027s Maze Grill restaurant in Chelsea, central London, as passersby watched on in horror at around 9.30pm on 7 March.          Mr Canny says he has four brothers so is not strangle to a bit of rough and tumbleMr Canny told MailOnline about why he tackled de Silva in an interview after the incident.He said  \u0027I got out the front door, one guy had smashed the window to my car. A second guy was smashing another vehicle, which was also an A-class Mercedes like mine.\u0027I came flying out wearing a pair of pyjama shorts and a summer jumper and one of them ran round the car and just came straight at me, which was the reason I managed to stop him.\u0027I used to play a lot of rugby, so I hit him with a shoulder and then I punched him a couple of times. I broke the visor clean off his helmet, which was one of those half-helmets with no jaw protector.\u0027He swung a quick sequence of frenetic punches, clearly shocked by my intervention. We exchanged a few blows, but the idea was simply to stop him. I didn\u0027t want to give him a kicking, but we did exchange blows.\u0027A second masked moped rider then stormed over to help his accomplice.He added: \u0027He grabbed my jumper and began to lay into me. I was fending one off and hitting the other one. Then I think it dawned on them. They thought, sh**, I\u0027ve just run into someone I don\u0027t want to be running into.\u0027Seeing he was outmatched, the second man got back onto his moped and raced away, leaving his partner facing Mr Canny alone.\u0027Not a lot was going through my mind,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027My only thought was, those absolute f****** b*******, breaking into my car. The second guy\u0027s hands were in back of my car.\u0027 Of the remaining suspect, he said: \u0027He was strong for small guy and from the look in his eyes I could tell he was off his head on something. He smelled strongly of marijuana.\u0027He was just lashing out at me and trying to push me against the wall. We started grappling and I tried to sweep him.\u0027It didn\u0027t work, but then I managed to get behind him and fold his body in two. I knew that he would eventually run out of steam.\u0027It was the sheer weight advantage allowed me to overpower him and stop him from getting away.\u0027We heard sirens. At that point he panicked, and for a good minute-and-a-half he was really kicking off to get away.\u0027Then he started apologising and offering to pay me and pay for the damage to the car.\u0027I told him to calm down and said I wasn\u0027t going to hurt him, but he had to stay here until the police came to take him away. I told him to stop fighting me, as I didn\u0027t want to have to hit him back.\u0027By this time, the man was sweating heavily and his helmet had entirely come off. He was struggling to breathe, and pulled down the balaclava he was wearing underneath the helmet to catch his breath.\u0027That was when he started to threaten me,\u0027 Mr Canny said. \u0027He said that he knew where I lived and that he would come back. I didn\u0027t take very kindly to that.\u0027I said you\u0027re not coming back anywhere mate, you do not threaten me like that. And we exchanged a couple more punches.\u0027Mr Canny admitted that he put himself at risk. \u0027If he\u0027d have pulled a knife, I\u0027d be in a lot of trouble,\u0027 he said.\u0027When I went out there I didn\u0027t know what I\u0027d find. There\u0027s huge risk involved in putting yourself in that situation.\u0027He added: \u0027I don\u0027t feel like a hero. I\u0027m just a person in the right place at the right time – or the wrong place at the wrong time, depending on how you view it.\u0027\u0027The police were extremely thankful. They said thanks to you catching him in the act, we have potentially solved 10 crimes by catching this guy. \u0027I had no time to think, I just acted.

Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to beIt\u0027s a bitter-sweet moment, even for people like me who\u0027ve been demanding it happen for nearly a decade.Before the comparative misery of recent years – just three (devalued) FA Cup wins in 14 years is not a return \u0027big club\u0027 fans paying the highest ticket prices in Europe should reasonably accept - Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans.We won the Double in his first season 19978, and again in 2002.Then in 2004, we became the first – and to date ONLY – team to go through an entire English league season unbeaten.The \u0027Invincibles\u0027 as they became known were a dazzling side, bursting with incredible talent like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, and a ferocious fighting spirit led by captain Patrick Vieira that cowed many opponents into submission before the game even started.When we won the League that season, at the home of our bitter North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, I was a guest of Lord Sugar\u0027s in the Spurs boardroom.Understandably, it had emptied long before Arsenal\u0027s players stopped celebrating out on the pitch.(Sugar was half way back to Chigwell before the final whistle, so desperate was he to avoid my inevitable gloating.)In fact, there was just me and my dad, ironically a lifelong Spurs fan, left when the door suddenly swung upon, and in walked Wenger and his long time No2, Pat Rice.I embraced them both like they were surgeons who\u0027d just saved my life – arguably, preposterously, this achievement felt even sweeter than that.Then I ordered the most expensive bottle of French red wine the boardroom stocked, at Lord Sugar\u0027s expense obviously, and the four of us sat alone together for an hour chatting about football.I met Wenger many times in those glorious early years and football was pretty much all he ever talked about.But he did it with such passion and knowledge.As anyone in the game will attest, Wenger\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with football.          Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans and he\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with footballHis idea of a great night is sitting at home watching a lower league Swedish reserve game on TV.For my part, that hour I spent in the Spurs boardroom with him remains one of the greatest experiences of my life.I can genuinely say I\u0027ve never loved any man more than I loved Arsène Wenger that day.By yesterday, 14 years on, that love had dissolved into a feeling of such despair I could barely look at the man.As Socrates said: \u0027The hottest love has the coldest end.\u0027And yet now, as I finally write Wenger\u0027s Arsenal obituary and remember the incredible highs I experienced under him in that first epic decade, those old feelings stir once more.Like any elongated orce, this has been a painful process for all Arsenal fans.Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to be.I particularly loathed seeing him showered with vicious personal abuse in the street from time to time by a few idiotic yobs.Contrary to popular belief, I have never hated Wenger the man I\u0027ve only hated his refusal to step down when it was obvious he should, especially when brilliant potential replacements like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola came on the market and were swooped up by Premier League rivals.But now, finally, he\u0027s done so and that allows me to pay tribute to Arsene Wenger, rather than incessantly moan about him.          Wenger pictured when he first arrived at Arsenal\u0027s then-home Highbury in 1996For eight years, he rivalled Sir Alex as the best manager in the world and based on that period alone, he was the best in Arsenal history.He\u0027s won 10 trophies in 22 years and over 1200 games.But his true legacy will be the way he transformed the way English football was played and how the players conducted themselves.Out went the beer, in came the scientific diets and fitness regimes.More importantly, Wenger drove his teams to play exhilarating one-touch, high-speed football of such exquisite skill and style that it made us the envy of the world.\u0027My never ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man,\u0027 he told L\u0027Équipe in 2016.That struggle grew harder in recent years as Wenger\u0027s powers lessened, but this is not the day to dwell on that.This is the day to look back with gratitude for the great times he gave us.Wenger\u0027s announcement hit the perfect note.\u0027I managed the club with full commitment and integrity,\u0027 he said, which is entirely true.Then he added: \u0027I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high. To all the Arsenal lovers, take care of the values of the club. My love and support forever.\u0027          I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirementWhether you were Wenger Out, or Wenger In, that\u0027s a sentiment to bring a lump to the throat.I hope we now go on and win the Europa League for him.That would be the best way to send Wenger off.It won\u0027t be easy because our semi-final opponents are the very capable Atletico Madrid whose manager Diego Simeone is just the kind of youthful, ruthless, dynamic firebrand that Wenger used to be.But I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirement.The Emirates stadium will be packed for every one of the final few home games, and the roars of \u0027One Arsene Wenger\u0027 will once again be heard all over North London.That is no less than he deserves.It\u0027s time for Wenger\u0027s most ferocious critics like me to get off his back and say what we have wanted to say throughout these long, tortuous years campaigning for his exit: \u0027Goodbye, Arsene, and thank you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/15/4B5ABBEC00000578-5638857-image-a-26_1524233083082.jpg","title":"Owner mansion ordered chop huge trees neighbour complained kept shadows","story":"    Dr David Hamilton owns the property Isla Bank House in Keith, Moray, a 12-bedroomed property that was built around 1892 and boasts antique furnishings and extensive gardens          A prolonged row between Dr Hamilton and his neighbour Stacey Chalmers over a \u0027green wall\u0027 of western red cedar trees has seen council bosses order a large section of the 230ft long hedge be cut down Mrs Chalmers said efforts to reach an amicable settlement with her Norfolk-based neighbour had failed despite numerous attempts in the past three years.She claimed the shadow cast by the enormous trees opposite her home forced her to have her kitchen lights on all year round and starved her back garden of sunshine.She used high hedge laws in a bid to have Moray Council order to take action after claiming the attempts at negotiating an agreement had left her \u0027stressed and overwhelmed\u0027.A report issued by council planners following site visits resulted in victory for Mrs Chalmers and an order to chop the trees issued last month.Planners said: \u0027The hedge is currently between approx 45 and 52ft high and therefore results in a significant impact on the applicant\u0027s conservatory and kitchen windows and rear private garden space. Elephants on the rampage in north London: Incredible...My brand new £700,000 house stinks!

You must be stupid\u0027. Canny, 33, a commodities broker from Essex, told MailOnline after the incident: \u0027Of course I\u0027d do it again. If it happened again tonight, I\u0027d do the same thing again and I wouldn\u0027t even think about it.\u0027He added: \u0027Why should I allow people to break into my property and damage my vehicle?

There were about 20 people watching in the end.\u0027 Before targeting the investment banker, de Silva and a pal stole over £1,000 in goods in thefts from Chelsea and Fulham residents earlier that night.          Former amateur rugby player Stephen Canny tackled the robbers in a pair of pyjama shortsOn Ellerby Street, Fulham, de Silva robbed lawyer Stephen Wisking and stole a Dell Laptop, an Apple iPad Pro, £100 euros, a blue canvas bags containing paperwork and another black bag from his BMW X5.He went on to Roskell Road, Putney, and stole Bose headphones and a red bag containing books and documents belonging to William Bond.In a third robbery at Beaufort Street, in Chelsea, he stole from Ashley Fromberg a black holdall and ID documents.The two Mercedes belonging to Stephen Canny and his girlfriend were the thieves\u0027 fourth target.He pinned de Silva onto the ground opposite Gordon Ramsay\u0027s Maze Grill restaurant in Chelsea, central London, as passersby watched on in horror at around 9.30pm on 7 March.          Mr Canny says he has four brothers so is not strangle to a bit of rough and tumbleMr Canny told MailOnline about why he tackled de Silva in an interview after the incident.He said  \u0027I got out the front door, one guy had smashed the window to my car. A second guy was smashing another vehicle, which was also an A-class Mercedes like mine.\u0027I came flying out wearing a pair of pyjama shorts and a summer jumper and one of them ran round the car and just came straight at me, which was the reason I managed to stop him.\u0027I used to play a lot of rugby, so I hit him with a shoulder and then I punched him a couple of times. I broke the visor clean off his helmet, which was one of those half-helmets with no jaw protector.\u0027He swung a quick sequence of frenetic punches, clearly shocked by my intervention. We exchanged a few blows, but the idea was simply to stop him. I didn\u0027t want to give him a kicking, but we did exchange blows.\u0027A second masked moped rider then stormed over to help his accomplice.He added: \u0027He grabbed my jumper and began to lay into me. I was fending one off and hitting the other one. Then I think it dawned on them. They thought, sh**, I\u0027ve just run into someone I don\u0027t want to be running into.\u0027Seeing he was outmatched, the second man got back onto his moped and raced away, leaving his partner facing Mr Canny alone.\u0027Not a lot was going through my mind,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027My only thought was, those absolute f****** b*******, breaking into my car. The second guy\u0027s hands were in back of my car.\u0027 Of the remaining suspect, he said: \u0027He was strong for small guy and from the look in his eyes I could tell he was off his head on something. He smelled strongly of marijuana.\u0027He was just lashing out at me and trying to push me against the wall. We started grappling and I tried to sweep him.\u0027It didn\u0027t work, but then I managed to get behind him and fold his body in two. I knew that he would eventually run out of steam.\u0027It was the sheer weight advantage allowed me to overpower him and stop him from getting away.\u0027We heard sirens. At that point he panicked, and for a good minute-and-a-half he was really kicking off to get away.\u0027Then he started apologising and offering to pay me and pay for the damage to the car.\u0027I told him to calm down and said I wasn\u0027t going to hurt him, but he had to stay here until the police came to take him away. I told him to stop fighting me, as I didn\u0027t want to have to hit him back.\u0027By this time, the man was sweating heavily and his helmet had entirely come off. He was struggling to breathe, and pulled down the balaclava he was wearing underneath the helmet to catch his breath.\u0027That was when he started to threaten me,\u0027 Mr Canny said. \u0027He said that he knew where I lived and that he would come back. I didn\u0027t take very kindly to that.\u0027I said you\u0027re not coming back anywhere mate, you do not threaten me like that. And we exchanged a couple more punches.\u0027Mr Canny admitted that he put himself at risk. \u0027If he\u0027d have pulled a knife, I\u0027d be in a lot of trouble,\u0027 he said.\u0027When I went out there I didn\u0027t know what I\u0027d find. There\u0027s huge risk involved in putting yourself in that situation.\u0027He added: \u0027I don\u0027t feel like a hero. I\u0027m just a person in the right place at the right time – or the wrong place at the wrong time, depending on how you view it.\u0027\u0027The police were extremely thankful. They said thanks to you catching him in the act, we have potentially solved 10 crimes by catching this guy. \u0027I had no time to think, I just acted. But it was great that the police thanked me and didn\u0027t give me a moment of bother.\u0027                                                      "},{"url":null,"title":"Bored construction worker adds twist classic arcade game using workers heads","story":"    Near miss: One of the workers narrowly avoids a direct strike to the head.

He has since grown tired of his team\u0027s poor performances and has been calling for him to goThis season has been even worse than that.We\u0027re currently 6th in the League, out of both domestic competitions, and all that\u0027s left to play for is the Europa League, the ugly sister to the Cinderella-style Champions League that no big club wants to play in.As performances on the field have fallen, so has the size of the crowds.The Emirates stadium, supposedly our bold new platform to the elite of world football, has resembled a half-empty graveyard at times during recent games.Yet still Wenger\u0027s excuses have kept coming there\u0027s always a reason for our persistent failure in big competition, which has nothing to do with him.In the end, there is one statistic that says it all: Sir Alex Ferguson has won the Premier League five times since Wenger last won it, and he\u0027s been retired for five years.It\u0027s been so sad to see the slow, inexorable demise of our once great titan.          Some Arsenal fans have long waged a campaign calling for Wenger to be sackedArsenal legend Ian Wright put it well recently: \u0027Watching Wenger now is like witnessing the ageing Muhammad Ali against Larry Holmes or Brazil\u0027s Ronaldo when he got fat. The problem with Arsène is there is no one in his corner prepared to throw in the towel.\u0027Well, now he\u0027s done it himself.Or perhaps he was urged to throw it by board members at Arsenal? I know at least one who told me a few months ago he was hoping to persuade Wenger to finally see the writing on the wall.It doesn\u0027t really matter.Wenger\u0027s going and it\u0027s the end of one of the longest and most extraordinary reigns by any manager of any football club.          Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to beIt\u0027s a bitter-sweet moment, even for people like me who\u0027ve been demanding it happen for nearly a decade.Before the comparative misery of recent years – just three (devalued) FA Cup wins in 14 years is not a return \u0027big club\u0027 fans paying the highest ticket prices in Europe should reasonably accept - Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans.We won the Double in his first season 19978, and again in 2002.Then in 2004, we became the first – and to date ONLY – team to go through an entire English league season unbeaten.The \u0027Invincibles\u0027 as they became known were a dazzling side, bursting with incredible talent like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, and a ferocious fighting spirit led by captain Patrick Vieira that cowed many opponents into submission before the game even started.When we won the League that season, at the home of our bitter North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, I was a guest of Lord Sugar\u0027s in the Spurs boardroom.Understandably, it had emptied long before Arsenal\u0027s players stopped celebrating out on the pitch.(Sugar was half way back to Chigwell before the final whistle, so desperate was he to avoid my inevitable gloating.)In fact, there was just me and my dad, ironically a lifelong Spurs fan, left when the door suddenly swung upon, and in walked Wenger and his long time No2, Pat Rice.I embraced them both like they were surgeons who\u0027d just saved my life – arguably, preposterously, this achievement felt even sweeter than that.Then I ordered the most expensive bottle of French red wine the boardroom stocked, at Lord Sugar\u0027s expense obviously, and the four of us sat alone together for an hour chatting about football.I met Wenger many times in those glorious early years and football was pretty much all he ever talked about.But he did it with such passion and knowledge.As anyone in the game will attest, Wenger\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with football.          Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans and he\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with footballHis idea of a great night is sitting at home watching a lower league Swedish reserve game on TV.For my part, that hour I spent in the Spurs boardroom with him remains one of the greatest experiences of my life.I can genuinely say I\u0027ve never loved any man more than I loved Arsène Wenger that day.By yesterday, 14 years on, that love had dissolved into a feeling of such despair I could barely look at the man.As Socrates said: \u0027The hottest love has the coldest end.\u0027And yet now, as I finally write Wenger\u0027s Arsenal obituary and remember the incredible highs I experienced under him in that first epic decade, those old feelings stir once more.Like any elongated orce, this has been a painful process for all Arsenal fans.Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to be.I particularly loathed seeing him showered with vicious personal abuse in the street from time to time by a few idiotic yobs.Contrary to popular belief, I have never hated Wenger the man I\u0027ve only hated his refusal to step down when it was obvious he should, especially when brilliant potential replacements like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola came on the market and were swooped up by Premier League rivals.But now, finally, he\u0027s done so and that allows me to pay tribute to Arsene Wenger, rather than incessantly moan about him.          Wenger pictured when he first arrived at Arsenal\u0027s then-home Highbury in 1996For eight years, he rivalled Sir Alex as the best manager in the world and based on that period alone, he was the best in Arsenal history.He\u0027s won 10 trophies in 22 years and over 1200 games.But his true legacy will be the way he transformed the way English football was played and how the players conducted themselves.Out went the beer, in came the scientific diets and fitness regimes.More importantly, Wenger drove his teams to play exhilarating one-touch, high-speed football of such exquisite skill and style that it made us the envy of the world.\u0027My never ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man,\u0027 he told L\u0027Équipe in 2016.That struggle grew harder in recent years as Wenger\u0027s powers lessened, but this is not the day to dwell on that.This is the day to look back with gratitude for the great times he gave us.Wenger\u0027s announcement hit the perfect note.\u0027I managed the club with full commitment and integrity,\u0027 he said, which is entirely true.Then he added: \u0027I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high. To all the Arsenal lovers, take care of the values of the club. My love and support forever.\u0027          I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirementWhether you were Wenger Out, or Wenger In, that\u0027s a sentiment to bring a lump to the throat.I hope we now go on and win the Europa League for him.That would be the best way to send Wenger off.It won\u0027t be easy because our semi-final opponents are the very capable Atletico Madrid whose manager Diego Simeone is just the kind of youthful, ruthless, dynamic firebrand that Wenger used to be.But I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirement.The Emirates stadium will be packed for every one of the final few home games, and the roars of \u0027One Arsene Wenger\u0027 will once again be heard all over North London.That is no less than he deserves.It\u0027s time for Wenger\u0027s most ferocious critics like me to get off his back and say what we have wanted to say throughout these long, tortuous years campaigning for his exit: \u0027Goodbye, Arsene, and thank you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/15/4B5ABBEC00000578-5638857-image-a-26_1524233083082.jpg","title":"Owner mansion ordered chop huge trees neighbour complained kept shadows","story":"    Dr David Hamilton owns the property Isla Bank House in Keith, Moray, a 12-bedroomed property that was built around 1892 and boasts antique furnishings and extensive gardens          A prolonged row between Dr Hamilton and his neighbour Stacey Chalmers over a \u0027green wall\u0027 of western red cedar trees has seen council bosses order a large section of the 230ft long hedge be cut down Mrs Chalmers said efforts to reach an amicable settlement with her Norfolk-based neighbour had failed despite numerous attempts in the past three years.She claimed the shadow cast by the enormous trees opposite her home forced her to have her kitchen lights on all year round and starved her back garden of sunshine.She used high hedge laws in a bid to have Moray Council order to take action after claiming the attempts at negotiating an agreement had left her \u0027stressed and overwhelmed\u0027.A report issued by council planners following site visits resulted in victory for Mrs Chalmers and an order to chop the trees issued last month.Planners said: \u0027The hedge is currently between approx 45 and 52ft high and therefore results in a significant impact on the applicant\u0027s conservatory and kitchen windows and rear private garden space. Elephants on the rampage in north London: Incredible...My brand new £700,000 house stinks!

Mathieu Asselin spent years photographing this damaged landscape – including a creek where the water runs redIn June 1957, Disneyland in California added a new building to Tomorrowland, its vision of a carefree world to come. Made of plastic, the House of the Future looked suitably avant garde and was entirely mechanised. Sponsored by Monsanto, then one of the world’s biggest chemical companies, it attracted 20 million visitors over the next 10 years.However, as Mathieu Asselin points out in his book Monsanto: A Photographic Investigation, a very different vision of the future was unfolding in Anniston, Alabama. There, since the 1920s, Monsanto had been producing PCBs, chemicals widely used in the creation of lubricants, inks, paints and electrical equipment. PCBs were banned in the US in 1979 due to fears about their toxicity, but the damage to Anniston had already been done. Between 1929 and 1971, some 27 tonnes of PCBs were released into the atmosphere, 810 tonnes flushed into Snow Creek canal, and 32,000 tonnes deposited in an open-air landfill site near the city centre, according to a 2005 report by the Environmental Protection Agency.PCBs linger long in the environment and have been detected in water far from their original source of release. Prolonged exposure causes skin rashes in humans and changes in blood and urine that may denote liver damage. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified dioxin-like PCBs as human carcinogens.“I began the book seven years ago and I have often been shocked by what I have uncovered,” says Asselin. Using a mixture of his own photographs, archive material, court files, Monsanto’s own adverts and the stories of campaigners and ordinary citizens, his hard-hitting volume, which is shortlisted for this year’s Deutsche Börse photography prize, attacks Monsanto’s reputation and its practices. His approach is unapologetically crusading. “I am playing with fire for sure,” he says.Asselin’s often low-key landscapes show a town in decline: empty buildings, abandoned businesses, dilapidated houses overgrown by trees and weeds. His equally melancholy images of local residents include one of David Baker, 65, head bowed by his brother’s grave. The caption reads: “Terry Baker died at the age of 16 from a brain tumour and lung cancer, caused by PCB exposure. The average level of PCB in Anniston is 27 times higher than the national average.”In February 2003, residents of Anniston won a $700m (£491m) settlement from Monsanto in a now-famous court case in which they argued the multinational was responsible for polluting the town and harming its citizens – and that the company had been aware of the toxic effects of PCBs on human health and the environment for decades, but had done nothing about it. In 2007, high pollution levels from PCB dumping were still being recorded in the nearby Snow and Choccolocco creeks. In one 2012 photograph by Asselin, the water at Choccolocco creek appears to be red.As Asselin’s book makes clear, the 2003 settlement was just one relatively small legal skirmish in a much larger and longer battle that has pitted a global chemical corporation against communities across America and the globe. That ongoing battle sheds light on a US lobbying system that skews the democratic process and often results in politicians, scientists and experts siding with Monsanto against farmers and communities. “In America,” says Asselin, “the company funds both the Democrats and the Republicans. They don’t have a political standpoint, they just need to make sure everything is OK to make more money. This is the bigger point I am making – global business just cannot go on like this. It has to change.”Monsanto was one of the producers of the highly toxic defoliant, which is now linked to cancer and birth defects among the Vietnamese population, as well as physical and psychological issues affecting returning US servicemen. One arresting portrait is of Heather Bowser, a woman born with several fingers and part of her right leg missing. Another is a closeup of her deformed hand holding a photograph of her late father, Morris, who served in Vietnam and whose own myriad health problems were directly linked to exposure to Agent Orange.Asselin’s installation at the Photographer’s Gallery in London, where the work of the four Deutsche Börse finalists is on show, includes two wall-mounted tablets that have Deutsche Börse apps installed so that they can livestream the daily stock market prices of Monsanto and Bayer. (In 2016, Bayer announced that it was planning a $66bn takeover of Monsanto.) This should please the sponsors of the prize no end, I suggest. “I have to handle the nomination carefully,” says Asselin. “It is a recognition from my fellow artists and professionals – but it is also a prize sponsored by another big multimillion dollar company.” When I mention the Syngenta photo award, which purports to address issues of sustainability while being sponsored by a global pesticide manufacturer, he says: “It’s the biggest bullshit around.” Asselin is a breath of fresh air in a contemporary photography world where conceptual ambiguity too often undercuts social or political commitments. “I often don’t understand what photographers are trying to tell me,” he says, “so I try to make sure there is no room for ambiguity in my work.

Just over 80 years later, another American orcee, Meghan Markle, is set to give the British monarchy a new lease of life. Yet Wallis and Meghan have even more in common than just being American and orcees: they have both had biographies about them by me published this year. Some things are truly written in the stars.Meghan’s has been a remarkable journey. Much has been written about the fact that her mother, Doria, was an African-American woman with liquid brown eyes of slave descent, but what is less well known is that her father’s family can trace their ancestry back to Robert the Bruce. So you could say that Meghan was born into royalty, if you didn’t have much material and were desperate to pad out your book to 80,000 words.Although her parents split up when she was five, Meghan has always felt she came from a very loving and stable background. As she once told a Hollywood gossip column reporter when she was desperate to go into acting: “I come from a very loving and stable background. Do you know anyone who could give me a job?”From a very early age, it was obvious to all those around her that Meghan was possessed of a unique talent. At her private school in Los Angeles, she was even cast as the star in a production of The Princess Bride ahead of Scarlett Johansson, who had only just been born. One of the most formative moments of her early life was watching the funeral of Princess Diana on television. Little did she know that less than 20 years later, she would be marrying the young prince who was walking behind his mother’s coffin carrying a copy of Andrew Morton’s fabulous book, Diana: Her True Story In Her Own Words.Have I mentioned that Meghan is biracial? Being biracial has always been an integral part of Meghan’s identity. Largely because her mother was black and her father was white. Just thought I’d mention it. After leaving university, where she narrowly missed out on winning a Nobel prize, Meghan set her heart on becoming an actress and it wasn’t long before the parts came rolling in. Her first role was in a straight-to-DVD film whose name I can’t remember in which she had to say the word: “Hi.” As the producer later told me after hearing Meghan was getting married to Prince Harry: “She was the only actress we auditioned who could say ‘Hi’ as if she meant it.”Her big break came when she was asked to be a regular on Deal or No Deal, a gameshow in which she had to walk on set wearing next to nothing holding up box number 26. As the girl who carried box number 17 told me: “We could tell Meghan was a natural and was going to marry into royalty.” Filming for Deal or No Deal was a demanding process, yet Meghan still managed to fit in a pilates class and get in some charity work in preparation for meeting Prince Harry.At some point or other, Meghan married a film producer called Trevor, but once she had landed a leading part in a TV series called Suits, she decided to let him go by text, as she didn’t want to put him through the glare of publicity. “Meghan has always been really thoughtful like that,” one of her close friends told me.Have I mentioned that Meghan is biracial? Now that Meghan was a Hollywood star whom almost no one outside Hollywood had heard of, she devoted her life to helping others. Along with posting selfies on Instagram and setting up a website to promote organic kale and other lifestyle necessities for biracial women.After dumping various other men who couldn’t help with her career, Meghan had almost resigned herself to being single. But then Cupid’s arrow went a-quiver under the incandescent African skies. (God, who writes this rubbish?) So Meghan and Prince Harry met on a blind date and it was love at first sight. “Hi, I’m Prince Harry,” said Prince Harry. “You had me at Prince,” Meghan gushed.Things moved swiftly after that, and it wasn’t long before Meghan was invited to have tea with the Queen. Using all the skills she had learned as an actress, Meghan spent days rehearsing sipping tea from a cup and eating cucumber sandwiches. The big day went off splendidly and the biggest hurdle of her life had been cleared comfortably. On the way home, Harry asked Meghan to marry him. “I know it won’t be easy and you will have to give up your charity work, but I’d like you to be my wife,” he said.“Oh don’t worry,” she replied. “I’ve always wanted to be a princess. And you’re so hopeless, you can be my very own charity project.”Meghan immediately settled into her new role and every member of the royal family remarked on how brilliantly she shook hands with strangers. “She’s going to be a real asset,” said a minor royal who was still hoping for an invitation to the wedding.Life under the royal glare is never easy, though, and there are some who worry that Meghan may quickly get bored. But hey! If she does, she knows where to come to tell her story.

The question is whether Trump has more than bluster on Twitter to impact the oil price. He probably does, but these tools are already in use. The US government has already opened up drilling rights on and offshore and US production is soaring as a result, adding to supply to the market.

Economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said:Even though worries about the global economy have been increasing on the back of trade war concerns and a higher oil price, there is still a lot to like for the Eurozone consumer. Inflation has remained subdued despite the higher oil price and unemployment continues to decrease. While consumers may not be on cloud nine anymore, the economic environment remains positive for consumption.Last month, consumer confidence was stable at 0.1, but underlying data revealed another deterioration in consumer sentiment. The lower expectations for inflation count positively in the indicator, making up for deteriorating views on the global economy, personal finances and chances of unemployment. The uncertainty in the global economy stemming from trade war concerns seems to play an important role here. ECB president Mario Draghi recently commented that the direct effects of a trade war on the economy would be quite limited, but that damage through weaker confidence could have a more harmful effect on growth. This release suggests that this channel may not be that concerning for consumers so far, but next week’s PMI release may prove Draghi’s concerns to be more significant for the business sector. Over in the eurozone and consumer confidence rose unexpectedly in April.The European Commission said its consumer confidence index climbed to 0.4, up from 0.1 in March and better than the forecast fall to -0.2. The commission said:The Eurozone’s consumer confidence indicator rose by 0.3 points from the previous month to 0.4 in April 2018, easily beating market expectations of -0.2, a flash estimate showed. In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment decreased by 0.5 points to -0.8. Oil producers meeting in Jeddah have hit back after Donald Trump said they were keeping crude prices “artificially high”. Reuters reports:OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said the pact between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to cut production had halted the collapse in global oil prices, and said the group was a friend of the United States with an interest in its prosperity.Output cuts “not only arrested the decline but rescued the oil industry from imminent collapse and is now on course to restore stability on a sustainable basis in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy,” Barkindo said.Energy ministers from the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, two OPEC members, also rejected the notion that prices were too high.The bid saga surrounding pharmaceuticals group Shire continues, with Japanese predator Takeda announcing an increase in its offer.The terms are improved from £46.50 to £47 a share, comprising £21 in cash and £26 of new Takeda shares.

The MPC had consistently talked up the chances of a May hike, despite a lengthy run of soft economic data, but the Governor gave a clear sign that the Committee is wavering.  There is now a very real chance of the next hike being postponed to June, or even August. But more important than the exact timing of the next move is the degree to which a more rapid slowdown in inflation and weak momentum behind wage growth could undermine the MPC’s case for subsequent hikes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd51f16cbf79df2d1d8a7a185fc70ee63a47bd17/1050_131_2133_1280/master/2133.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9623bc59fff7aba29ee1b932c42214c6 1240w","title":"asia argento metoo harvey weinstein italy","story":"Since accusing Harvey Weinstein of rape, I have been vilified in Italy. But I’ve got a message for these predatory enablersI have been called all of these things and more since I first began to speak out last October about being raped in 1997, when I was 21 years old, by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. For speaking my truth, I have been slut-shamed, victim-blamed, bullied, and threatened on a daily basis. And I am not alone.Women everywhere, emboldened by the #MeToo movement, have had the courage to share their most painful private traumas in public, only to face blanket denials and further assaults, this time on their character, their credibility, their dignity.Six months after the Weinstein story broke in the New York Times and the New Yorker, more and more high-profile establishment figures, from motivational speaker Tony Robbins to Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, are also feeling emboldened – not to confess their cowardice as shameless spectators but to denounce the #MeToo movement. It’s open season on survivors. The larger our number, and the more outspoken we are, it seems, the greater the ferocity and frequency of attacks. The most brutal and vicious response to this flowering of female political thought and action is taking place in my home country, Italy, but the poison seeps out.That is why I spoke last week alongside two formidable and outspoken Italian women: Laura Boldrini and Ambra Battilana Gutierrez at the Women in the World summit in New York.For defending women’s rights in Italy, Boldrini has been subjected to outrageous and at times violent intimidation. Her effigy has been burned in the street. One small-town rightwing mayor suggested that she should be raped by migrants. Matteo Salvini, the extreme rightwing leader of the Northern League, brought an inflatable sex doll that he referred to as “Boldrini” to a political rally. This scurrilous defamer may yet become Italy’s next prime minister. Another member of the Northern League called for her “physical elimination”. Beppe Grillo, founder of the Five Star Movement, is barred from running for election himself because of a manslaughter conviction. But his party won the largest share of the vote in Italy’s recent election, and he asked his two million Facebook followers: “What would you do if you found Boldrini in a car?”Gutierrez is the fearless young model who went up against Silvio Berlusconi and Weinstein. She testified about what she saw and experienced at Berlusconi’s “bunga bunga” parties during the infamous “prostitution trial” in 2011. Two years later, the NYPD asked Gutierrez to wear a wire during an encounter with Weinstein. She recorded what turned out to be an explosive piece of audio. For this, the tabloids smeared her as a prostitute and blackmailer.We have a message for these predatory enablers.What began in Italy is now manifest in the US and beyond, public discourse degraded into a sick tabloid fantasy, of sex, corruption, violence and lies. What began with Berlusconi continues with Trump and Weinstein. All are men in positions of power and of a now all-too-familiar type, who view women as chattels to serve their sexual lust and to puff up their fragile egos, and who then, later, try to cover up their crimes with bribery, threats and intimidation. The exploitation of women has been central to each of their paths to power. Weinstein used his company to hunt for prey. Trump used the Miss USA Pageant to gain power and influence in the business and media world.Berlusconi showed them both the way. He corrupted Italy by degrees through a vast media empire that includes three national TV channels, Italy’s largest book and magazine publisher, Mondadori, and a daily newspaper, Il Giornale. Striscia la Notizia, a weekly TV show on Berlusconi’s Canale 5 featuring half-naked showgirls, makes a mockery of the news, yet it has been the highest-rated and most-watched TV show in Italy since the late 1980s.Over time, the exploitation of women as mindless, unspeaking, submissive sex objects has proliferated across Italian TV. These images of women insinuated themselves into the subconscious of the nation, colonising the culture like a fungus and distorting the ambitions of young Italian women.This, they were told, was how to be admired and to succeed: play dumb, be silent, act sexy. An object of desire without a voice. And Berlusconi was able to achieve this because, in Italy, women were already worth less than nothing, forced into one of two roles: the mother or the whore. Italy has long been sexist to the bone. Misogyny, it seems, is the rule of law, femicide a fact of life. In Italy, one woman is killed by a man every 60 hours. One out of every three women has been subjected in their lifetimes to some form of sexual violence. One in three!Until 1981, charges of rape could be dropped by Italian legal authorities if a rape victim agreed to marry her rapist. That horrendous practice was known as “reparatory marriage”. Until the same year, a husband could kill his wife if he believed she had committed adultery and receive only a minor sentence. Until 1996, rape was not even considered a crime against a person, only a crime against the “public morals”.Think about that. And even after the law was changed, the statute of limitations for reporting a rape runs out after six months. After that, it’s not possible to secure justice. It’s as if the law was enacted to prevent the reporting and prosecution of rape. To pretend it is not even happening. A law written by men, for men. A law designed to protect the rapist.And so, not surprisingly, when I spoke out about Weinstein, Italy was the only place where my story was not accepted or believed. Instead, my reputation was traduced, my story distorted, my credibility made hostage to smears.Almost daily, Italian television featured a discussion panel made up of people who did not know me, people I had never met, who felt qualified to argue whether I had been raped or not dissecting my story, my life, as if they were detectives at a scene that existed only in their salacious imaginations. And the conclusion these great detectives came to was that not only was I asking for it, but I wanted it and benefited from it. What happened to me was not rape, they said, it was prostitution. In their eyes, I was not even worthy of being a victim of this monstrous crime. In their eyes, I was not even good enough to be raped. This relentless dehumanisation in the Italian media eventually gave others beyond Italy the idea they could vilify and slander me with impunity also.Some of the cruellest and most hurtful comments came from those I do happen to have known. The director Catherine Breillat calls herself a feminist but puts her own interests above those of women. In a recent interview she mourned the loss of Harvey Weinstein for European cinema and said not a word in support of the scores of women he raped, assaulted and harassed. By launching a truly vicious character assassination of me, she tried to tarnish the credibility of all Weinstein accusers.Then consider the actor and male model Vincent Gallo. To promote himself and the men’s fashion line he was paid to wear, he used the pages of a British fashion magazine, Another Man, to make a malicious, unprovoked attack on me and Rose McGowan. (I hardly know Gallo, and was only briefly acquainted with him almost two decades ago.) He brought shame on Yves Saint Laurent and its creative director Anthony Vaccarello, who allowed its model to sell its clothes while doing a hatchet job on two survivors of sexual assault. Yves Saint Laurent and Another Man publisher Jefferson Hack shamed themselves by allowing Gallo to do this in their name without censure, or question or qualification, and silently profiting from the publicity. And they call us prostitutes? I will not allow these squalid gaslighters to go unchecked in their character assassinations. Of me, of #MeToo, of anybody. None of us should tolerate them.By contrast, we might all celebrate Nanine McCool. This brave woman stood up in a packed arena before tens of thousands people and faced down the self-styled self-help guru Tony Robbins. This man, a ludicrous, Ken doll manbot stereotype of strutting male machismo, towered over her and attempted to use his physical presence to intimidate her. McCool stood her ground, and did not back down. She won the argument, and unmasked this giant as a naked pygmy. This he clearly regretted only when a video of their interaction went viral online, threatening to hit him where it hurt – his bottom line. It forced him to issue a PR-scripted “apology”.We are all Nanine McCool. I stand with her and all survivors. Their pain is my pain. Their trauma, my trauma. Their fight is my fight. Their voice, my voice. My own experience, my own pain, turned me into an activist, and gave me a calling, a mission and a message, something far more valuable for my self-respect than any career in movies. Six months ago, the world changed, definitively and irrevocably. The balance of power tipped, at last, in favour of the survivors who have been given a voice and platform to speak their truths to the world. If we remain strong, determined, vigilant – if we support each other – the intimidators will fail.What has been done cannot be undone. What has been revealed can no longer be hidden. What has been said can no longer be unspoken. For speaking truth to power, I have been called a whore, a liar, a traitor and an opportunist. The one thing I will not be though, the one thing none us will be, is silenced.• Asia Argento is an Italian actor, director and activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e13ec6c3f9412f20c84395b46dcf8e4b194689/0_153_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=15ff93e735c5453e8a298285c92ce2df 1240w","title":"brexit views 48 percent respected democracy","story":"Given that the UK is split, it’s only fair if the government delivers ‘Brexit in name only’, as is looking increasingly likely“We’re heading for Brexit in name only, so I’m pretty frustrated.”Join the club, Nigel Farage. The tortured process of leaving the EU has been pretty frustrating for everyone, not least the remainers, who see their conviction that Brexit will leave Britons worse off corroborated by every new report about the country’s future. While there are some who believe the whole thing can be stopped, it seems the prospects of that are dwindling. But so is the Brexiteers’ dream of a complete rupture, or a hard Brexit behind red lines. Today, the Daily Telegraph reports that the EU has “comprehensively rejected” British proposals for a magic border-but-no-border in Northern Ireland. The government’s conjuring trick, like David Copperfield’s, has been exposed – except no one was really fooled in the first place. “It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work. None of them,” said the Telegraph’s source. Michel Barnier has apparently stopped the EU’s internal preparations for trade talks until Theresa May comes up with a better plan. EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.The better plan is of course to remain in the customs union. But this is something that May has ruled out, time and again. EU implacability, combined with an opposition that begs to differ and a House the Lords that knows its own mind, now means she may be forced to reconsider. Remember May has agreed that, in the absence of acceptable “specific solutions”, Northern Ireland must “maintain full alignment” with EU regulations. If her “specific solutions” continue to be laughed out of court, she’s in a bit of a pickle. Her government is made possible by the DUP, which would never accept regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain. So we could conceivably end up both in a customs union and closely, if not entirely, aligned with the single market.This will naturally infuriate Brexiteers. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson declared: “Without ... your ability to do things in a different way if you want, and your ability to do free trade deals, there is very little point in Brexit.” We’ve seen that Farage is “frustrated”. Keep a fire extinguisher handy: some of his wackier cohorts might spontaneously combust at the new threat to their “beautiful Brexit”.This is clearly not an electorate that decisively favours Brexit. It does so only very tentatively. It does not matter if, among the 17.5 million who voted leave, there are many, even a majority, who feel strongly that a clean break from the EU is best. The government serves the whole country, and 16 million people wanted nothing to do with Brexit at all. The democratic solution to this split is therefore to enact Brexit, but remain closely aligned with the EU. That is the course that most closely reflects “the will of the people”. It might well mean “Brexit in name only” – a situation that completely satisfies neither side, a classic fudge, stirred in Brussels and left to set in Westminster. But it is a situation that best embodies the results of the vote. It’s a cautionary tale about referendums, for sure. But if there are Brexiteers who finds themselves “frustrated” by it, perhaps they aren’t quite the democrats they claim to be.

Leave.EU says Cambridge Analytica “has never carried out any work on behalf of Leave.EU”.However, the data scandal continues to engulf the firm. The Conservative MP Damian Collins, who is the chair of the cross-party digital, culture, media and sport committee currently scrutinising “fake news”, has said that the story – which led to Facebook’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, recently being grilled by US lawmakers – is “only in the foothills”, and is a broader global issue.Because of my expertise, I was recently asked by the UK’s Electoral Commission, the Information Commissioner’s Office and the digital, culture, media and sport committee to submit evidence relating to electoral campaigns by Cambridge Analytica, SCL and others who were involved in the campaigns.I researched SCL’s war-on-terror work for my book on propaganda and counter-terrorism, for which I conducted numerous in-depth interviews. Over the years I was able to build up enough contacts to place me in a rare position to gain access to interviews on the 2016 US election for another new book about media bias and the rise of Trump, co-authored with professor Robert M Entman of the George Washington University. I have also been working on research and publications about the EU referendum.I was alarmed by what my research uncovered, and it was both a matter of personal conscience and public responsibility as an academic to provide information to the various inquiries and investigations that are now under way.For over a decade, I’ve conducted interviews with government personnel and key contractors, including SCL, working in a very secretive area as part of my research on UK and US propaganda during conflicts. I gained access slowly at first, gradually winning confidence through introductions once I had a few contacts in this tight-knit and suspicious field.In my 2015 book, I explored how a romanticised British military reputation that strives to win over the “hearts and minds” of the public overlays a mythologised notoriety for the “dark arts” of information warfare. This myth helped Britain to extend a perception of expertise, and inflate its importance among Americans during the “war on terror” conflicts. The so-called special relationship between the two countries, and perceptions of “British expertise” in propaganda, aided me in gaining access to research interviews in the US.I’ve observed that this niche perception of British expertise in the dark arts can prove helpful for former military contractors when promoting their work in the US. SCL and Cambridge Analytica appear to have similarly extended their reach in politics by using US perceptions of “Britishness”. By way of example, Cambridge Analytica’s former research director Chris Wylie – who was first to blow the whistle on the company – claimed it had sought to create the impression it was linked the University of Cambridge.Cambridge Analytica, incorporated in Delaware but headquartered in London, was set up in 2013 and is a closely affiliated subsidiary of SCL.My evidence and recent coverage from Channel 4 News show how the ex-Cambridge Analytica CEO, Alexander Nix, would push his firm’s supposed notoriety in the dark arts in brazen ways – such as the invasive psychological profiling of US citizens during the Trump campaign – while a public image of SCL projected its apparent moral compliance and respect for democracy.The top executives – such as SCL boss Nigel Oakes – could be charming in interviews, as I recently explained on BBC Radio 4. For Oakes, the activities we discussed seemed normal. Oakes told me he saw Nix as “the guy who wants to sell the flashy box”.He added: “… frequently people come to us and say ‘we’ve got so many dirty tricks against us, we now need to know the dirty tricks to go back’. Or: ‘We need to know how to counter the dirty tricks and you guys seem to know how to do it.’”My discussions with interviewees on the topic of unethical conduct emerged cautiously, but with a knowing smile, over casual cream teas in a London shopping centre. All this with my recording device on the table.I earned my interviewees’ trust by being open about the purpose of my research and asking the right questions, sometimes very directly, in a way that made them feel comfortable. I told interviewees connected with Leave.EU that I had voted for Britain to remain in the European Union, because honesty helps to build trust.Andy Wigmore, who is the former communications director of Leave.EU – which failed to become the officially designated campaign for British voters who wanted to exit the European Union – told me that the group had copied strategies shared with Leave.EU by Cambridge Analytica. But Leave.EU didn’t go on to hire Cambridge Analytica, and says Cambridge Analytica “has never carried out any work” on its behalf. .He also said that whipping up concerns among voters about immigration was “the main thrust” of Leave.EU’s campaign during the Brexit referendum.Wigmore now claims that his interview with me was “not for publication” and described the release of evidence to parliament as “wilful deception and trickery”. In fact, the entire exchange was on the record and Wigmore’s willingness to contribute to the research is recorded on tape several times.It takes a calm, friendly, diligent approach for a researcher to gather this much illuminating material. A ton of patience and time is also required to move beyond evasiveness and gain access to closed elite networks. As a sociologist, I learned how to navigate Cambridge Analytica and SCL’s subculture and used similar language to build an understanding of how the modern day “propaganda machine” works.• This article was originally published on The Conversation• Emma Briant is a senior lecturer in journalism at the University of Essex"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a13f118d1248efa1ecec5640b4ee2ca5df256bf/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=afffec38ab9a04b871f58413ebe26465 1240w","title":"ministers scroungers lose forms pm windrush","story":"Lose one form, and you lose cancer treatment and your liberty – lose a generation’s forms, and you’re the effing PMIf I were editing a tabloid newspaper this week – and I’m always open to guest stints – I would have had advertising vans out since Monday. They would have been crawling v-e-r-y slowly back and forth past the houses of Theresa May, Amber Rudd, Nick Timothy and David Cameron – and those just for starters. Instead of the repulsive GO HOME message that adorned the infamous vans May’s Home Office sent out, which resulted in the eventual deportation of precisely 11 migrants, I would have something along the lines of STAY HOME. Stay home, permanently.Whether they would get the message is uncertain. Collectively, Britain did its very best to provide a hostile environment for May with the election result. The message was very clear: take a hike. Not a hiking holiday, but the full hike.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Yet the import does not seem to have got through to the prime minister, or the various arse-coverers around her. It’s fair to say we are dealing with a very specific class of unworthy here. There are few groups who take less responsibility for their actions, as this week in the Windrush scandal has laid starkly bare. Some of the most senior political figures in the land are – in the purest sense of one of their favourite terms – shirkers. They are feckless. They act like these things are happening to them, as opposed to because of them. Given the judgments they like to visit on the weaker members of society for comparatively minuscule transgressions, this makes them the most raging hypocrites too.In the Home Office, Amber Rudd can’t even commit to a personal pronoun. “I am concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes loses sight of the inidual,” was the verdict of the specific inidual who is the actual home secretary, and who was clearly very much wishing people would lose sight of her. Complete tools always blame their workmen, and the civil servants union chief has now come out to imply this of Rudd.In No\u0026nbsp10 Rudd’s Home Office predecessor still, bogglingly, resists any personal blame. In one of his newspaper columns, May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, claims – wrongly – that May was against the vans and was on holiday or something, while referring to the “so-called hostile environment policy” when it was literally called so by him and his boss. Meanwhile David Cameron – in pursuit of whose ludicrous back-of-a-napkin immigration targets all this was done – disembarked from the gravy train momentarily this week to ignore the subject entirely in a CNN interview.And on they all go. If the government is in any doubt as to why so many millions think it’s one rule for them and another for the little people, then this week couldn’t be a better primer. You lose one form and you lose your job, your cancer treatment, your benefits, your liberty you lose a generation’s forms and you’re the effing prime minister. Those condemned to battle the systems that ministers design know what happens if they make tiny errors. Furthermore, they know that if they messed up a tenth as badly in their jobs, they’d be sacked. But in the arse-over-tit world of government, you’re safe because your sacking would make the big boss – May – look weak. Just like your HR department, right? Except on crystal meth.I don’t want to fall back on a series of politicians’ best-loved cliches, but this level of irresponsibility is just scrounging with a red box. They play for high stakes – but never their own. It’s the sort of system-milking demonised in a benefits office in Grimsby but regarded as career progression in Westminster. It makes it appear there’s no glass ceiling in modern political life, just a reinforced lead floor. Once you’re in, you basically have to die to stop earning rewards. Take Timothy, who we can’t describe as back on his bullshit, because he’s never been off it. I’ve had yoghurts in my fridge longer than he was in the political wilderness. Or Cameron, whose CNN interview saw him still regurgitating his catchphrase “it was the right thing to do”. I do hope his forthcoming book embraces the absurdity, and is called All the Right Things to Do that I Did.Perhaps the most staggering part – for those of us not being imprisoned or barred from our mother’s funerals, I should stress – is how little self-awareness our leaders have about their failures and their own part in them. May still reckons the worst thing she ever did was run through a wheat field.I saw this show several times. Even if you weren’t the Self-Knowledge Impregnator’s target, you could still see the word every time you shut your eyes for ages afterwards. Don’t tell me we don’t invent beautiful machines in this country any more.Or at least we did. That was 21 years ago. Where is the Self-Knowledge Impregnator now? Has the hour of need ever been greater? Can’t it be strapped to the back of an advertising van and driven at top speed to the next cabinet meeting, in the name of human decency?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dfed3184b10606e5797d883c5d9f5e7ced015fc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=76dff2ba1fd01ee42d0a38bd19dd4c6f 1720w","title":"theresa may windrush equality","story":"The outrage about the exclusion of ‘worthy immigrants’ must not blind us to the outrageous policies that made it possibleOne of the most tragic aspects of writing about gun deaths in America is hearing black parents make the case for why their child should not have been killed. They will impress on you that their children were not gang members, even when you don’t ask. They will make sure you know their kids had never been in trouble with the police, even when it is not relevant. In short they want to make it clear their child was a casualty worthy of your grief and empathy.There are good reasons for this. Parents want to preserve a cherished memory of their child, and by emphasising good character they accentuate the obscenity of the tragedy. But the primary motivation is to counter the assumption that black youth are feral, lethal and essentially criminal, and if they were shot it’s probably because they deserved it.For each family this makes sense and can hardly be criticised. But collectively it lends credence to the notion that there are children getting shot who are unworthy of our grief and empathy: the tragedy becomes not that a kid has been shot but that the wrong kind of kid has been shot.As the British government implodes over the treatment of the Windrush generation we must ensure that the rightful outrage about the exclusion of those who are now, finally, perceived as “worthy immigrants” does not blind us to the outrageous immigration policies that made such exclusion possible and will continue to exclude others deemed “unworthy”.Theresa May is not apologising for creating a “hostile environment”, expressly designed to spread fear in immigrant communities, when she was home secretary. She is simply conceding that the Home Office has been hostile to the wrong people. The apology, as it stands, is not for the existence of a policy that is unfair, unjust and discriminatory and causes anxiety, penury and despair, but for the ostensible misapplication of it. Over the past week, the official regrets have been too narrowly tailored, the memories too selective, the mendacity too brazen and the callousness too pernicious to see the government’s parsed and partial expressions of remorse as anything other than an insult to our intelligence.The government has accepted it has made mistakes. The trouble is that it has confessed to the wrong ones. Depriving British citizens of their jobs, healthcare, benefits, pensions, housing and liberty, if they could not provide up to four pieces of documentary evidence for every year they have been here stretching back over 50 years, is not the result of an administrative error. If it had been, it could have been corrected five months ago, when the Guardian broke the first story relating to this scandal. Back in 2014, May did not set out to create a “rigorous” or “stringent” environment, but a “hostile” one in which all migrants would be considered illegal unless they could prove otherwise, and Britain would adopt a “deport first, appeal later” ethos. This is what it looks like.They were warned. On 30 January 2014 Diane Abbott asked May whether she had considered “the effect that her measures that are designed to crack down on illegal immigrants could have on people who are British nationals, but appear as if they might be immigrants?” They knew they were doing wrong. Virtually every time my colleague Amelia Gentleman wrote about a person’s case, the Home Office would contact their lawyers within a day – sometimes within an hour – of the article going online to say the problem had been resolved.Last month, when alerted to the case of Albert Thompson, who was denied cancer treatment unless he paid £54,000, even though he’d lived in Britain for 44 years, May said she sympathised but would not intervene because he needed to “evidence his settled status” in the UK. As recently as last week, Downing Street said she would not meet Caribbean heads of state, in London for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, to discuss the issue.The mistake the government made was assuming the woes of a few elderly black people born in the Caribbean could not prick the nation’s conscience. They underestimated the pull the Windrush generation could have on Britons’ sense of self. This was not an irrational calculation. When the 2014 Immigration Act that enshrined the “hostile environment” policy was passed, Ukip was riding high in the polls and immigration was the nation’s principal concern. Labour backed the act and only 18 MPs (including Jeremy Corbyn, David Lammy, John McDonnell and Abbott) voted against it. So long as they were talking about “illegal immigrants” and not human beings, that consensus held.But there is, it turns out, a positive story we can tell ourselves about race and immigration. In the week of the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech, we have been celebrating the contributions of black foreigners. We have heard about taxes they have paid, the communities they have built, the families they have grown and the way they have changed Britain for the better. We have been talking about immigrants as though they have humanity and about immigration as though it could benefit us.What is true of immigrants who arrived 70 years ago is true of immigrants today. The fact that these people are being celebrated today is not a product of Britain’s innate sense of fair play. The Windrush generation is far more popular now than it was just after the Windrush docked, when white youths would go “nigger hunting” and signs declared that black people were not welcome in pubs and hostels.And what is true of racists 70 years ago is true of racists and xenophobes today. Over the past week this ageing cohort has been elevated to the status of national treasure. This has been made possible partly through nostalgia and partly through the affection of the communities in which they have long been embedded, but not least through the constant struggle that continues to be waged for equality.So long as the government has a policy of hostility towards immigrants, that struggle continues. These laws are not bad because they ensnared the Windrush generation this just clarified the obscenity and amplified the bigotry on which they were based. They\u0026nbspare bad laws because they are designed to turn every Briton – doctor, landlord or teacher – into a border guard, and every migrant, whether they have a\u0026nbspright to be here or not, into a suspect. Britain owes the\u0026nbspWindrush generation a debt of gratitude. The best way to repay them, after securing the citizenship of all\u0026nbspwho are entitled to it, is by learning the lessons of the\u0026nbsppast 70 years rather than repeating the mistakes.• Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian.

Thanks for all your questions!Miracle of Istanbul still the greatest day ever?Yes. Sadly I was not there I was at home watching it on the telly with my son who was six at the time. At half time I turned to him and said it\u0027s over, this could be seven of eight nil, and he said to me \u0027no dad, we\u0027ll win this\u0027. I thought he was totally delusional but of course now I think he\u0027s a genius. And he\u0027s a diehard Red like his dad.What are your favourite sweets?In The City and the City, do you think there is any deep metaphor for what it is like to live in the modern European city?In The City and The City my character can not see or hear anybody from the other city which is sometimes right next to him. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a stretch of the imagination to see that in our everyday lives. We walk passed people all the time who are in terrible circumstances compared to our own. Sometimes we don\u0027t hear people in distress, closing our ears to things right next to us and China Mieville has taken those circumstances and pushed them in creating the worlds of Beszel and Ul Qoman. So, yes, I do think it has resonance with the way we live today.Are you wearing shorts today?Any chance you’ll be returning as Thorne?Not at the moment. But I did love doing that job, which I also produced. Mark Billingham the writer of the books is a good mate, and we\u0027ve often talking about redoing it. So who knows. I hope so because it is a character I feel there are more stories to tell about.Was Holding On the turning point in your career? I don’t think it’s ever been repeated – I thought it was excellent.I wouldn\u0027t say it was a turning point but it was the job that I met the writer Tony Marchant who became a great friend and I later directed his piece Passerby with Jimmy Nesbitt. That was one of the first directing jobs I had and that started me on a career behind the camera as well as in front of it. It had a great influence on me in that way. I wish they would repeat it. It was a fantastic piece of work and some of the best writing on television.Brecht urged actors to adopt a ‘gestic stance’ in order to help define the emotion within a character and the context. Are you a practitioner of his theory or do you just wing it?I don\u0027t just wing it. I work from the inside out. I work from emotions and my relationships to other characters. The hopes and fears of my character. I\u0027m not an actor who works from the outside in, getting the shoes right or the stance right or external things, although I know great actors who do do this.What felt more life-changing moving from Liverpool to London to attend Rada as a working-class actor or moving from London to America to become a film star?Definitely moving from Liverpool to London. It felt so alien to me. I remember asking someone on the street for directions and they looked at me like I was dirt. That would never happen in Liverpool. I was used to being in a city where you sat on a bus, next to a total stranger and would end up talking for the entire journey like you\u0027d known each other for ages. So I found London a very unfriendly place at first. But once I found my way around and got to meet some \u0027real Londoners\u0027 I made it my home and it has been that ever since.One Summer resonated with a lot of my generation, everyone watched it and talked about it school the next day. Can you remember anything about it? Did you know you were working on something pretty groundbreaking?Yes, I have great great memories of One Summer and Spencer Leigh and Ian Hart still remain great friends of mine. It was the show that made me fall in love with acting and the whole process of film making. I have great affection for it. Someone recently sent me the soundtrack on vinyl, and it brought back so many great memories. It\u0027s also where I met the great James Hazeldine who was not only my great friend but my mentor for many years, sadly no longer with us. He was one of the biggest influences on my life.Mo Salah or Ian Rush in his prime?IT would have to be Rush, at the moment. I love Mo Salah and I think Liverpool have such an exciting team at the moment and a bright future, but they need to start winning stuff. No one can argue with Rushy\u0027s trophy cabinet. Here\u0027s hoping that Mo and the team can start bringing trophies to Anfield soon.I love it when you DJ! Did you ever do it when you were younger? I didn\u0027t DJ when I was younger but I was king of the mixtape. That was my gift of choice. Instead of buying somebody flowers, chocolates etc, they\u0027d get a C-60 (or a C-90 if I really liked them) cassette full of my favourite tunes. Having the chance to play tunes on a radio station and communicate with people has been a dream come true. I really can\u0027t wait to get back to it when I have some time off. Thanks for listening!I admire your work with refugees. What first inspired you to work with them and do you see yourself continuing to do that for a long time?I am a goodwill ambassador here in the UK for UNHCR. I have been doing work with them to highlight the plight of refugees for a number of years now and I will continue to do that for as long as I can. I feel that the refugee crisis and how we handle it is truly the challenge of our age. Reaching out to people, helping people who are fleeing murderous circumstances is a no brainer to me. We\u0027ve seen in history what happens to people when the world turns its back on them and it\u0027s up to us in the 21st century to ensure that that doesn\u0027t happen again.Besides reading the novel, what kind of research did you do for The City and the City’s Inspector Tyador Borlú?One of the things I researched for The City and The City was what it was like for people living under oppressive regimes. How people can be controlled by subtle restrictions of their civil liberties, how the spread of paranoia can control people and how the fear of speaking out is crippling to any society.Hi David! What were your favourite filming locations in Liverpool and Manchester for The City and the City? I know it was special for you being in your hometown.One location on The City and They City was inside the Mersey tunnel. Although it was pretty grubby down there I never thought as a child when I drove to Wales through the Mersey tunnel that one day I would be filming a major TV series in that very place.How was your experience of playing Mark Antony in Julius Caesar at the Bridge theatre? How did your characterisation of Antony come about?It was a wonderful experience all round. Great cast, great crew and brilliant audiences. I think The Bridge is a very special theatre and I will remember the experience for a very long time. What is amazing about Shakespeare is how even now he is relevant to us and can give us insight into human behaviour that illuminates the very situations and times we are living in now.Do you regret Basic Instinct 2?No. Absolutely not. I made great friends on it. I thought it was a great script. I know it didn\u0027t turn out to be the greatest film in the world but I\u0027ve never regretted any job I\u0027ve gone into. You learn from all your work but the knocks that you take whether it be from journalist, reviews etc all serve to make you stronger.What advice would you give to a young person now without any means or support but who is really burning to go into acting?I am very worried about the lack of support for people from low-income backgrounds trying to get into the creative arts. It\u0027s always been a difficult profession to break into but I feel now with drama and the visual arts being taken out of school curriculum it\u0027s even harder. My advice is never give up. Join amateur dramatic groups. Get your friends together to read plays and scripts, make your own film on your phone, it\u0027s about knocking on doors writing letters and believing in yourself.I loved your portrayal of The Governor in The Walking Dead. Is there any chance that you’ll ever play the role again? An adaption of the Rise of the Governor novel would make a wonderful prequel!I would love to play the role again, however there are no plans to do it. Not to my knowledge anyway. He was a character that I felt had great depth and complexity. Not just a cardboard baddy. A lot of my inspiration for the role came from the books written by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga. I think these books are fantastic and I think it would be wonderful to do a mini series of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c13a2ed65aff1ed3884b8694f5d13e588bb2d20/0_0_4480_2980/master/4480.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74395f7560e8f853121508c4e573344b 960w","title":"upcycled denim sustainable lace fashion to feel good about this spring","story":"Ethical and sustainable are the biggest buzzwords in fashion at the moment.

When he shot Robert Loggia (that chazzer) the audience cheered. When he wore a white brimmed ladies hat and flirted with Michelle Pfeiffer the audience cheered. But when he got blown away by a sawed-off shotgun at the end, the audience cheered at that, too. When people say the love Scarface, they love every bit of Scarface.The Oliver Stone-penned, Brian De Palma-directed rags-to-riches fable is 35 years old, and an anniversary screening at the Tribeca film festival that this vulgar, brutal and, um, powdery gangster tale is every bit as entertaining as you remember. Though close to three hours, it zooms from the first electronic Giorgio Moroder beat to its final discharge of bullets. That a dazed, sourpuss Al Pacino slumping in a banquette surrounded by neon-lit mirrors half-listening to Richard Belzer make cocaine jokes is only one of this film’s indelible images tells you something.After the rowdy screening, De Palma, Pacino, Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer came out for a nearly 40 minute chat.Pacino, wearing a yellow scarf over a black shirt, was lively and gregarious, and explained how the film germinated after seeing Howard Hawks’ 1932 Scarface at a repertory theater in Los Angeles in the late 1970s. He dialed up producer Martin Bregman in New York, with whom he worked on Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (and later Carlito’s Way and Sea of Love) and said: “I want to be Paul Muni.”Oliver Stone was commissioned to write a script and Sidney Lumet, who was the original director, had the idea to adapt it to the Mariel boatlift, in which 125,000 Cuban refugees came to Miami in 1980. Pacino and Bauer, who was born in Cuba with the name Esteban Ernesto Echevarría Samson, spent a month together, hanging out and creating backstories for their characters. “He helped me with everything Cuban,” Pacino said, who, in case you don’t know, is not Cuban, of Bauer.At its release, Scarface was notorious for its language. The F-bomb is dropped 207 times, or 1.21 times per minute. (It was a record holder until Eddie Murphy: Raw came out four years later.) “Bombast was part of what we were trying to say,” Pacino offered as explanation. This led to De Palma discussing the difficulty he had with the censors to get an R rating instead of an X.“I’d had battles with the ratings board on all the movies I made, and this was a last skirmish,” he said. He sent three different versions and when the final one still got an X, he went back to his original and said: “We’re going to war with these people. And we won.”Things got cringeworthy (but at least spirited) when the panel moderator, Jesse Kornbluth, asked his first direct question of Michelle Pfeiffer after the 16-minute mark. “As the father of a daughter,” he began, “I’m concerned with body image. The preparation for this film: what did you weigh?”The capacity crowd at the 2,800 seat Beacon Theatre booed and hissed, and one woman shouted: “Why do you need to know?!” As Kornbluth got defensive, Pfeiffer responded: “Well, okay, uh, I don’t know, but I was playing a cocaine addict, and that was part of the physicality of the part.” Being a pro, she was able to spin a yarn out of this inelegant question, and explained how it was supposed to be a three or four month shoot, but the filming went for six months. “I was starving by the end of it. I had members of the crew bringing me bagels, they were so concerned – I was living on tomato soup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dcea5491bdfafbb79f04f869cb6392b8530e1b8/19_130_3393_2036/master/3393.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9de63c88eeb9301db122534bb280811f 1240w","title":"natalie portman israel genesis prize","story":"Jerusalem-born actor was due to receive 2018 Genesis prize but cancels saying she ‘cannot in good conscience’ attend ceremony• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayNatalie Portman has pulled out of a major award ceremony due to take place in Israel, citing her “distress” at recent events in the country.However, Portman informed the Genesis Prize Foundation she would not travel to Israel for the ceremony, which has been cancelled. No specific events were mentioned, but the recent military response to Palestinian demonstrations on the Gaza-Israel border has provoked worldwide condemnation.

And so the credits finally roll. Like reaching the end of some heaving biopic, it may take a while for Arsène Wenger to feel able to shake himself back into the real world, to emerge blinking from that life intensely lived as manager at Arsenal Football Club, to take off the red and white spectacles and not assess everything through that prism.Finally, now, he has reached that point that for so long seemed impossible, the trigger which has pushed the endgame button. The mantra that he would always respect his contract, the stubbornness that made it so implausible that he one day would do that, has been blown. The debate bubbled and frothed around him for years, for quite a lot of that turbulent second half of his tenure in London N5, but the truth is it was something that Wenger could not easily judge for himself because he was always so immersed. Bob Dylan caught the mood in inimitable style in one of his piercing love songs: “I could stay with you forever and never realise the time.” Wenger’s collaboration with Arsenal sucked them in deep, which is why, for club and man, this break will shudder through the both of them. Moving on, after such a long spell entwined, will be strange.Maybe it seems like yesterday, the cool January afternoon in 1989 when Wenger turned quizzically to the taxi driver who pulled up in the terraced streets near to Avenell Road and queried: “But where is the ground?” Retelling the story he remembers the reply – “We are here” – with the same mixture of bemusement and curiosity he had all those years ago. A very first visit to Arsenal, when he was the 40-year-old manager of Monaco passing through London, puzzled him most of all because he could not quite believe a grand and famous old stadium could exist amongst what appeared to be ordinary streets full of ordinary houses. He was charmed. Something of the romance of that first meeting never left him as he would in his later years occasionally drive by the façade of the old place, park up and indulge in some nostalgia.Maybe it seems like yesterday that he walked into a dressing room in the autumn of 1996 to find a squad coming to terms with the fact its inspirational captain, Tony Adams, had only days before announced his struggle with alcoholism. A predominantly British group, with stereotypically British qualities, would soon be open to progressive ideas even if a foreign manager was not initially everybody’s cup of tea. Adams described his own scepticism as “contempt before investigation” but would soon see how much there was to learn from a manager so different to those he came across before. Dennis Bergkamp was already in situ, a fresh-faced arrival with telescopic legs called Patrick Vieira had been ushered in on the incoming manager’s recommendation even before he arrived. Before long Wenger blended old and new perfectly to win the Premier League and FA Cup double.Maybe it seems like yesterday that David Dein, the Arsenal chief executive and friend of Wenger, signed a form to check the manager into a hotel at a gathering of football gliterati and on the section for profession wrote “miracle worker”. How about that for esteem. Arsenal were wowed by him in those early years. The “Arsene Knows” banner that aired frequently epitomised that. Back then dissenting voices were simply nonexistent.Maybe it seems like yesterday that the team were dubbed Invincibles for turning Wenger’s dream to complete a league campaign without defeat into glorious reality. Those peak years included a Champions League final, and a style of football that was widely admired. Some fans took to using the nickname “Wengerball” to explain the high-speed passing, injected with ingenuity and aesthetic combinations, which were a hallmark of the way they played at their very best. Nick Hornby summed it up by describing the surreal feeling for a fan who had seldom had the highest expectations to be watching some of the best players in the world play right there in front of his eyes in his club’s colours.Maybe it seems like yesterday that Arsenal bid farewell to their soulful home, Highbury, and moved down the road to the shiny, new bowl with naming rights that would be known as the Emirates Stadium. It was a change that would have massive ramifications, and conveniently enough, the two addresses are associated with the two contrasting periods of Arsène’s Arsenal.Maybe it seems like yesterday that the tide began to turn and title bids collapsed amid jokes about the top-four trophy. Years without silverware were clocked up and fingers began to point at Wenger as his new project, to attempt to build a successful team out of youth products educated to believe in the club and its ideals, was picked apart by richer, more ruthless, competitors.The more recent yesterdays have been brutal at times. There have been humiliations on the pitch, protests off it, and the atmosphere around the club deteriorated to the point where more seats lay empty on a match day as apathy set in, more of the disaffected sought to demonstrate against their manager and the way the club was run.A glorious history versus an underwhelming present was the nub of the argument that provoked so much friction. In one of his great quotes, Wenger predicted the problems that would ultimately fracture this great footballing relationship. “If you eat caviar every day it is difficult to return to sausages,” he said. It is hard to believe that quote stretches back to 1998, and the weeks after Wenger blazed a trail by becoming the first foreign manager to win the Premier League.Win 2-0 against Blackburn in Wenger’s first match in chargeDefeat Everton 4-0 to win Premier League titleBeat Newcastle 2-0 to lift FA Cup and complete the doubleWenger offers to replay Sheffield United following controversial FA Cup winLost 4-1 on penalties to Galatasaray in Uefa Cup finalWin 1-0 at Old Trafford to win the league titleA 2-2 draw at rivals Spurs confirms third league title winBeat Leicester 2-1 to complete The Invincibles’ unbeaten seasonFinal game at HighburyDefeated 2-1 in Champions League final by BarcelonaLose 8-2 to Manchester United at Old TraffordMarks 1,000th game in charge by losing 6-0 at ChelseaWins record-breaking seventh FA Cup with victory over ChelseaDespite defeating Everton 3-1, they finish outside the top four for first time in Wenger eraAnnounces he will leave Arsenal at the end of the seasonHow do you like your sausages? In many ways that sums up how and why the latter period of his Arsenal career has been so complicated. Arsenal’s owner, Stan Kroenke, and the board who act according to his business plan, have seemed perfectly happy with sausages and shown no obvious craving to do everything they possibly can to get their hands on some caviar.Here’s the thing. Wenger’s own apparent acceptance of more modest fare is perhaps the most intriguing element of all. He knew exactly what ingredients were needed to build a conquering team. So why settle for less? He could have left Arsenal at several points along the way, not least when he knew he was in for a few challenging seasons in the immediate aftermath of the move from Highbury to the Emirates. Finances were restricted, the football landscape was changing rapidly with the arrival of oligarchs and investors from far and wide. He chose not to be tempted by offers from some of Europe’s giants, clubs with more financial muscle and stability, to oversee a huge redevelopment. There was no trophy for that even if Wenger regards that period – keeping the club near the top – as one of his successes.It is interesting to remember there was no serious fan unrest in those first few seasons post-move. The mood has hardened in the subsequent phase, the years that Arsenal were supposed to be on an even keel and able to compete with anyone. The record signing of Mesut Özil in 2013 was symbolic of that shift. But, barring the not-to-be-sniffed-at phase of three FA Cups in four recent seasons, Arsenal’s same old problems of falling out of contention for the most eye-catching honours, the Premier League and Champions League, have loaded critiques at the manager’s door.It remains a mystery that a manager who saw the building blocks for success close up has veered away from those characteristics. Original Wenger teams were based on a defence with a loathing of conceding goals – first from the back four inherited from the George Graham years, and then rebuilt around the steel of Sol Campbell and company. Then came a midfield heart that had both steel and silk as epitomised by Vieira. The attacking embellishment dazzled – bold players who knew how to fight for the right to express themselves in the manner of Thierry Henry, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, Nicolas Anelka, Bergkamp.Original Wenger teams were powerful and fast. The more recent creations have become vulnerable, slower, more predictable. Was he stale? Could he not cut it any more? To the last, he resisted that notion and felt sure he could build one more great Gunners side. Even if critics thought he had been given too many chances his belief never wavered.All Wenger’s Arsenal yesterdays are now in the history books. In time those stories retold will be kinder to him than the critics who have become sharper and angrier than ever in recent times. Act One of his story will be remembered more than Act Two.Wenger has spoken often, and with feeling, about how Arsenal became “the club of my life” and the two decades and counting that came to an end encompassed numerous emotional hits. Along the way there have been spiritually uplifting highs, harrowing lows, and just about everything in between. He wanted to emulate Sir Alex Ferguson in the longevity stakes. He has always said that he wants to manage as long as he feels physically and mentally strong enough to do so and even during the difficult moments his inner resilience, his capacity to come out fighting, has been something he has been able to rely upon.Funnily enough, when he joined in 1996 he envisaged being Arsenal manager only for a few years. But the longer he stayed, the more the club got under his skin to the point that not being in the role was something to dread.Few other modern managers in England had as profound an impact on one club. Ferguson, in terms of trophies, trumps everyone. But in terms of putting an imprint on a club Wenger can stake a strong claim. He was fundamental to the building of a modern, lucrative stadium, pushed for the developmemt of one of England’s first high-tech training grounds, brought an international eye for recruitment that delivered some of the best players to grace the Premier League, and fostered a love for a beautiful style of football that was light years away from the “Boring Arsenal” tag of old.Historically, the influence of Bill Shankly over Liverpool, Matt Busby over Manchester United, Brian Clough on Nottingham Forest shine on to this day. Those managers became part of the fabric of their club, enmeshed in its soul. Arsenal had their first visionary in the 1930s in Herbert Chapman. But the obvious difference between all those luminaries and Wenger is that the others were all products of British football and a British cultural upbringing.Wenger came to Arsenal a foreigner with not much of a name or reputation on these shores at a time when English football was still quite insular and resistant to overseas ideas. Not that long before that it was banned from Europe, a kind of pariah which accentuated the sense of distance between the English ways and continental ways. “What does he know, coming from Japan?” Fergie pondered sharply when Wenger first began to make waves in England following his arrival from Grampus Eight, which was symptomatic of a mistrust of ideas that were perceived to be new wave or revolutionary to an English scene.Wenger became part of the furniture. By the end we all felt we knew him so well, foibles and all. He was a manager who always – always – stood by his values. For better or for worse he did his job with unstinting conviction. As Dein noted when he first came across this intellectual Frenchman with a name that made him think it was destiny he would at some point be associated with Arsenal, he was “different”.He thinks a lot about the human side of management. He prefers to regard his players as people first and athletes second. He has a keen interest in finances and social policies and a view of the world outside the football pitch. As a man, he has many characteristics that seem contradictory but all go to make up this unique manager. He has a razor-sharp wit but can be absent-minded and clumsy. He is kind and generous but a terribly sore loser. He speaks with confidence in public yet remains very private away from the game. He is addicted to the intensity of the best sporting challenges but loathes personal conflict. He is somehow one of the most liberal-minded of managers and also the most stubborn. As a man, his kindness and generosity are held in the highest esteem by those who know him.Whatever lies ahead – and there is as much chance of it getting better as getting worse – one man cannot easily fill the void he leaves. He is the last of the managerial overlords, the long-term managers who dedicate decades to one club. After all Wenger’s yesterdays, Arsenal without Arsène will take some getting used to."},{"url":null,"title":"arsenal announce arsene wenger departure live","story":"As the speculation swirls, perhaps a good time to look back on these quotes from Thursday’s Wenger news conference on the subject of Patrick Vieira, currently manager of New York City FC. “He’s a guy who has the potential one day, yes,” said Wenger. “I’ve followed his managerial career. I think he does very well. But he works in the moment in New York and he works for Man City. There are plenty of former players who played here who have potential and the intelligence and the knowledge to do it. So there’s plenty of choice, don’t worry for that.”Mikel Arteta, currently Pep Guardiola’s right-hand man at Manchester City, is another former player and captain who has been linked. The tributes are slowing up a little but the news agenda may be about to shift when Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal CEO, holds a news conference at 5pm. We don’t think that’s going to be an announcement of the new man, more clarification and next steps. And perhaps what future role, if any, Wenger has to play at Arsenal. And if you want to sign up for The Fiver, here’s the linkHere’s today’s Fiver which is about...well, it’s not about Colin Garlick leaving West Brom. Guardian readers have had their say on WengerThe aforementioned Jupp Heynckes has had plenty to say about Wenger. More Rafa on WengerWhen he came here to England, to do things in the way he did and win in the way he was winning was a massive achievement. His behaviour has always been quite good. He is an example for everyone, but especially a foreign manager like me. He was fighting and winning before me, and it was really difficult to do that. He did really well. I think it is the last time we will see this. There is so much money in football now that everyone wants things quickly and want to change things after a couple of bad results, we saw that ourselves when we had a bad run. The reality is that you have to be patient and have an idea and a plan. If you stick with the plan you have more chances to do well and that is what he did for 22 years.Here’s what Wenger had to say on the occasion of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement five years ago next month. Makes for interesting reading and perhaps suggests he might continue in the game. There’s a few European clubs could do with someone like him, and Wenger in the Bundesliga or back in France seems in no way outlandish. Jupp Heynckes is still at it, and he’s 72, four years older, though due to retire this summer. Now, of course, not everybody has been a Wenger fan down the years and Stewart Robson has been, if not a lone voice in the wilderness, then someone who has never hid his views on Arsenal’s perennial manager. Robson spoke to the BBC earlier. He was fantastic in that period but, like a lot of dictators, they think they are going down the right road - but even when people are saying you need to change, he wouldn’t change. Arsenal under Arsene Wenger in the last few years have been too one-dimensional and behind the times in recruitment and physiotherapy. It is the best thing that could happen to Arsenal that he is leaving now.Simon Smith emails in: “I hope Kim Källström didn’t see that Wenger worst XI. In his autobiography he described scoring his FA Cup penalty as the best 15 minutes of his life – which considering he went to the World Cup with Sweden and won the French league a couple of times at Lyon is something of an achievement. Surely enough to keep him from the list?”In mitigation, Simon, his inclusion was more to do with his being signed injured in an injury crisis and then playing only four matches. He was a good player, no doubt, but maybe not for Arsenal.The news Wenger jumped before he was pushed finally answers the questions of when Arsenal’s execs would have the courage to close in on him. The net had been closing in with the recent appointments of Sven Mislintat as head of recruitment, Francis Cagigao, head of international recruitment, Raul Sanllehi, head of football relations. Wenger had stopped being omnipotent and that spelled the end was coming. Pep Guardiola gave his news conference today. “All my respect for what he has done. The Premier League is about huge personalities like Arsène Wenger, it is because of what he has done, his vision. I wish him all he best in the future, I hope he can be involved in world football in a different way with his experience - at Arsenal, UEFA, FIFA, I don’t know. It was a pleasure to compete against him here, at Barcelona, Bayern Munich.”Sir Alex Ferguson, as would be expected, has spoken with Manchester United’s official website about the man with whom he shared the Premier League’s deepest rivalry. Fergie knows a thing or two about good send-offs.I am really happy for Arsène Wenger. I have great respect for him and for the job he has done at Arsenal...I am pleased that he has announced he is leaving at this stage of the season, as he can now have the send-off that he truly deserves. He is, without doubt, one of the greatest Premier League managers and I am proud to have been a rival, a colleague and a friend to such a great man.Kanu on Le Boss. David Moyes, who takes West Ham to the Emirates on Sunday, has his say.He’s been a great competitor, a terrific manager who has graced the Premier League for many years. He’s a proper football man who lives and breathes it. To do 22 years is an incredible achievement.Sean Dyche has growled his thoughts on le grand départ. He is a legend of the game - the work that he’s done will be remembered. Some things that now seem normal and simple weren’t at the time. Hydration in football sounds a simple thing but was not taken to a high level. Making sure the food they were eating was correct. Their health and well-being. For youngish managers like myself there are not enough good words you can use for what he’s done.There was a fair discussion the other day of Benítez’s credentials to take over from Wenger. He wasn’t a popular choice for many Arsenal fans, but that doesn’t mean he’d do a bad job.Rafa Benítez on his old adversaryI have been talking well about him for a while. To do things in the way that he has done and win the way he was winning, for so many years... we are talking about one of the best managers in football history.All the stories are coming out now. Per Mertesacker has doubled down with a video tribute.Holding back the years?Win 2-0 against Blackburn in Wenger’s first match in chargeDefeat Everton 4-0 to win Premier League titleBeat Newcastle 2-0 to lift FA Cup and complete the doubleWenger offers to replay Sheffield United following controversial FA Cup winLost 4-1 on penalties to Galatasaray in Uefa Cup finalWin 1-0 at Old Trafford to win the league titleA 2-2 draw at rivals Spurs confirms third league title winBeat Leicester 2-1 to complete The Invincibles’ unbeaten seasonFinal game at HighburyDefeated 2-1 in Champions League final by BarcelonaLose 8-2 to Manchester United at Old TraffordMarks 1,000th game in charge by losing 6-0 at ChelseaWins record-breaking seventh FA Cup with victory over ChelseaDespite defeating Everton 3-1, they finish outside the top four for first time in Wenger eraAnnounces he will leave Arsenal at the end of the seasonOne of Opta’s main men with those longest-serving manager stats. Eddie Howe, once heavily linked with succeeding Wenger, with whom he has a good relationship, will become the Premier League’s longest serving manager. John is refreshed after being allowed to see the sun out of the window and eating his sandwich, so he will be back on duty for the foreseeable. The Manchester United manager was also asked about whether he had any regrets over his relationship with Wenger down the years but he was relatively calm on the matter.“It is not about regret. I think your question is a type of question from somebody that was not in this site. You were not a manager or a player. You don’t know the way we respect each other, even when sometimes it looks like in some moments we don’t. Players that get yellow or red cards by aggression against each other or have bad words against each other in the end are probably the ones that respect more each other. It is power against power, quality against quality, ambition against ambition. In the end it is people from the same business. People that respect each other’s career. It is not about regret. What happened for me is the way I respect he person, the professional, the career. For some the memories are short. But real football people, the ones inside the four lines playing or the managers or the referees, we are the real football people. They don’t ave short memories.”Mourinho also certainly knows that Wenger will have a lasting legacy in the Premier League, something he will be eyeing himself.“Three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups and what he did in Japan, in France, what he did for French football, what he gave to Arsenal even in period without Premier Leagues, the transition from stadium to stadium, we know what he did. If he is happy, I am really happy and I hope he doesn’t retire.”Mourinho did not use his pre-match press conference to stir things up over Wenger’s exit. He was very diplomatic with his comments, a surprise considering the number of run-ins he had with the Arsenal boss.“If he is happy I am happy. If he is sad I am sad. I always wish the best for my opponents,” Mourinho said. “I always wish the best. For me that is the point. If he is happy with the decision he made, if he looks forward to the next chapter of his career and life, I am really happy for him. If he is sad I am sad. I am pretty sure that we as a club, especially because Mr Wenger and Arsenal were for many years the biggest rivals of the Sir Alex era, we will show Mr Wenger the respect he deserves.”Our man David Hytner writes that Wenger decided to leave rather than risk being sacked.Fears over the team’s success and season ticket renewals saw some unrest in the boardroom, resulting in a few pondering ordering Wenger’s P45.It would have been a sad end for him to be dismissed, so it was sensible for him to exit.Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has had his say on Wenger’s decision to leave, although he does not seem too worried about having another manager on the market, like the Italian is likely to be in the summer. “My reaction... I think we must pay a great tribute to Arsene Wenger for his career. For his career at Arsenal. He and Ferguson, we’re talking about the last two managers to stay for such a long time in a club. Arsene Wenger worked 22 years for Arsenal. I think that’s great, it’s a fantastic story. He won a lot at this club and, for this reason, I think he deserves a great tribute for his career.“I think Arsene is one of the managers who had a great influence on football because, in every moment in his idea of football, he tried to play good football, creative and offensive football. He deserves great tribute also for this.“He deserves great respect. Not only from Arsenal supporters, but from the whole world of football. He deserves great respect. We are talking about one of the best managers in the world with a great and important career with Arsenal. He deserves a great tribute for his career. It would be very difficult to see in the future another manager staying for such a long time at the same club. I think, maybe, Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were a really good story for football. Now it will be very difficult to see that again, another situation like this.”Former Arsenal defender Alex Scott says Wenger’s departure is a “sad day for the Premier League”.Sky Sports News have got the big exclusive with Arsenal TV’s Claude. Sadly, things have not gone to plan. Claude offered up some top insight: “I don’t want to go into the manager too much.” I think you’re missing the point of your appearance here, Claude.It is testament to Wenger that players who have graced the Arsenal books from those who have played one game to those who stayed for a decade. Graham Stack was the second choice goalkeeper during The Invincibles campaign an he has spoken very highly of his former manager. Might have thought more of him if he was ever give a Premier League appearance.What a day it has been, from an earlier rumour of a statement about something or other from Arsenal to Wenger order a removal firm to empty his office of its content.There’s been no shortage of tributes and a few gleeful celebrations about the Frenchman’s departure but the long and short of it is that Wenger did alter football in England, even if he has not maintained the momentum in recent years.Will Unwin will take over the reins from me for a while. Cesc Fàbregas, on the bench for the best XI, has paid Instagram tribute. He had faith in me from day one and I owe him a lot, he was like a father figure to me who always pushed me to be the best. Arsene, you deserve all the respect and happiness in the world. classact”. Time also, then, to consider a worst Wenger XI. This one is weighted more heavily to the later years. Let’s go 4-3-3 here, to mirror the late-period Wenger era. Some of these were and are decent players but it didn’t go well for them at Arsenal.Email or tweet with your thoughts on both those teams if you’d like. Club captain Per Mertesacker has been speaking to Arsenal’s official website. We have just been informed basically. It is quite emotional. Obviously he has been at the club for such a long time, he has been so supportive to me. One major reason why I’m here is because of him. It’s been emotional and there will be time to digest it but it is a sad feeling right now...He gave us the opportunity to explore ourselves in order to be successful, and he’s always managed to get the team around himself to be successful. The memories of winning titles with him and bringing joy to so many people - something he has done for years - is a heck of an achievement.Arsenal fan Toby Moses on the long goodbye for Wenger. RVP weighs in So, Patrick Vieira is the early bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Wenger. He’s top of the MLS Eastern Conference with New York City FC and his appointment would be something of a punt to find the same success Barcelona once found with Pep Guardiola. It would be the type of move Manchester United rowed back from with Ryan Giggs. Brendan Rodgers is also high in the betting. Such an idea was floated a few months back to real dissent from Arsenal fans, but as Jamie Carragher has said, Celtic’s manager might well be the best British boss of the moment. A random name to throw in? How about Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca? Highly regarded and linked with Everton at the moment but the Wenger news has changed everything.Want to pen your own tribute? Time to think of a best ever Wenger XI? Here’s my potted selection. Needless to say, it combines the late-1990s early days in combination with the 2003-4 Invincibles. It’s a 4-4-2 in the spirit of that age with a subs bench of seven. Sadly, no place for Granit Xhaka.

In 2004, Nintendo abandoned the wildly successful Game Boy portable consoles in favour of an ugly silver clamshell with two screens, the DS. Two years later, when other games companies were focused on improving their consoles’ graphical power, Nintendo popularised motion control with the comparatively underpowered Wii. Both announcements attracted scepticism and even mockery from players and market analysts alike, and both sold more than 100m each.The company’s experimental approach is not always successful, however. Though Nintendo’s most recent console, the Switch, has been a huge success so far, its predecessor, the Wii U, was one of the worst-selling games machines of all time. Nintendo Labo, out today in the US and on 27 April in the UK, is one of Nintendo’s weirdest ever ideas: a set of cardboard construction kits that, combined with the game software packaged with it, can be used to create interactive toys.The key to this magic is the Nintendo Switch’s little controllers, which snap away from the screen. These JoyCons contain a bundle of sensors and feedback mechanisms including gyroscopes, an IR motion camera and rumble. Slotted into a cardboard fishing rod, they can sense movement and velocity tucked in the back of amini cardboard piano, they can see stickers on the back of the keys that tell the console which note to play. The game cartridge includes specially built games for each model, instructions for building them, and a “Discover” section that explains how they work in a kid-friendly but unpatronising manner.“After the development of Nintendo Switch, we worked on creating all kinds of different prototypes, with the theme of creating something that was straightforward and that only the Nintendo Switch and Joy-Con could make happen. Nintendo Labo came out of this process,” says Koichi Kawamoto, producer on the Labo team.Abandoned prototypes during that two-year effort included a model tank and a music box, according to Labo’s creators. “We made a music box prototype where you rotated a cylinder with reflective stickers stuck on it in a spiral shape,” elaborates Tsubasa Sakaguchi, project director. “By using the IR motion camera to detect the movements of the stickers, we could make the rotation speed of the cylinder determine how fast the music played. It was an interesting mechanism, but we thought that consumers wouldn’t actually have that much fun playing with it. The most important thing for us was whether consumers would find it exciting and fun.”The five models that have made the cut at launch include a little house with buttons and dials, a fishing rod with a string attached to an elastic-band reel, a simple remote-control car that judders across the floor powered by the controllers’ vibrations, an approximation of a motorbike with handlebars and a brake lever, and a working cardboard piano. There is also a cardboard robot suit, available in a separate kit, that can translate your movements into a game in which you are a giant robot smashing up a city.The Labo software has a garage mode that lets you experiment with elements of programming, opening up the possibility for players to create their own cardboard contraptions. One example from Nintendo is a cardboard guitar with elastic-band strings. Expect to see a flurry of these sorts of creations from the maker community in the months after Labo’s launch.“The fundamental concept of Labo came from thinking how we could leverage the JoyCon controllers,” elaborates Shinya Takahashi, GM of Nintendo’s development ision. “We wanted to see if there were any attachments that we could put on them, and cardboard was the material that came to our mind instantly. It’s a material that’s easy to modify, shape, and attach on to JoyCons – trial and error and repair are all easy. Through the experiment our development team realised that selling already created cardboard attachments may not be fun enough – the process of creating and learning the process and the mechanics behind it is rewarding in itself.”Like all of Nintendo’s products, Labo is oriented towards families and children. A six-year-old might spend three hours using pens and glue to make the perfect RC car, whereas an older child (or parent) might spend more time learning how the models work. The more complex models would be demanding for many children to assemble by themselves, but with parental help the process is collaborative and fun – reminiscent of hours spent with Airfix models or dolls’ houses in previous generations.When Nintendo announced Labo in January, the reactions ranged from perplexed delight to qualified scepticism: will people really pay £60 (or $70) for some cardboard? It might only be £10 more expensive than a “normal” game, but Nintendo’s madcap ideas often take some explaining before people buy in to them. The next few months will determine whether Labo becomes a fondly remembered curiosity, or another of the Switch’s big sellers.•Additional interviews by Keith Stuart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e32d9dd5c4ca48a9da55d6f4175724d4794d39/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=41b2e445237823b727749c5489dd1dd9 2600w","title":"untouchable myanmar army un united nations blacklist","story":"A handful of recent convictions show troops are starting to be held to account, while the military are listed for the first time on a UN armed forces blacklistThe three young men went out to get firewood and never returned. Their families spent days worrying, then heard gunshots crackling in the distance. Hours later, they found the mutilated bodies, hastily buried five miles from their homes at the Maihkawng internal displacement camp in Myanmar’s conflict-torn Kachin state. They suspected that soldiers from Myanmar’s army were responsible, but they didn’t expect anything to happen to the perpetrators. On Monday, in the UN’s annual report detailing acts of violence carried out by armed forces in 2017, the Myanmar military was listed for the first time. The report, which was presented to the security council, found “widespread threat and use of sexual violence was integral to their strategy, humiliating, terrorising and collectively punishing the Rohingya community”.It’s a pattern of violence that the military, known locally as the Tatmadaw, has repeated for decades – kidnapping, torturing and murdering civilians with total impunity.However, this time was different. Shortly after the murders, a group of lawyers got in touch with the victims’ relatives and encouraged them to give statements to the coroner and demand a post-mortem report. The result was a hand-scrawled document that detailed shattered skulls and bullet wounds, helping to make it impossible for the Tatmadaw to plausibly deny its soldiers’ crimes. In January, seven months after the killings, the six soldiers responsible were handed 10-year prison sentences by a court martial. “Without that report the soldiers wouldn’t have been convicted,” says Khun Naung, chairman of the Kachin Legal Aid Network, also known as Shingnip. In a country where the army is considered untouchable, the lawyers have helped in recent years to secure a handful of rare convictions against soldiers who violate human rights. The group’s 20 lawyers work pro bono and even pay rent out of their own pockets for the traditional wooden house that serves as their office. They founded Shingnip in Kachin’s capital, Myitkyina, in 2011, shortly after the breakdown of a 17-year ceasefire between the military and Kachin rebels caused a spike in abuses by government troops against civilians, says Khun Naung. “They’re working on all the cases no one else dares to,” says David Baulk, a Myanmar-based researcher for Fortify Rights, a group that monitored the Maihkawng case.While these convictions are a “first step” in the fight against impunity, he adds, they are a long way from delivering real justice. For one thing, most of the trial was held in secret. “The Tatmadaw kept the victims’ families in the dark for about five months,” says Baulk.There are even doubts as to whether the convicted soldiers in this and other cases are actually serving their prison sentences because the authorities refuse to say where they’re being held. Even so, with the police under military control, the investigative work of Shingnip and others is the closest thing to accountability for people in Myanmar’s conflict zones.Shingnip also helped secure a two-year manslaughter conviction last year against a soldier who had shot dead a student named Gum Seng Awng in front of several witnesses on the streets of Myitkyina. Most were too scared to talk, but Shingnip found two willing to give statements. The sentence was much lighter than the family had hoped Shingnip was pushing for the soldier to be tried for murder. But their work on the case led to the release of Gum Seng Awng’s friends, who had been part of the altercation that led to his death. The military claimed the friends had tried to steal soldiers’ guns and shoot them, but the witnesses disputed that. Other claims were easier to debunk. “The soldier said in a press conference that he drove back to his base this way and was attacked by Gum Seng Awng on the way,” says Khun Naung, sketching a crude map of Mytikyina on a whiteboard at his office. But that doesn’t make sense because there was a much shorter route, he adds. “It’s obvious the soldier followed them and then the trouble started.” It’s unclear exactly why the military chooses to prosecute certain cases, but the work of activists, lawyers and journalists who uncover the truth is a major factor.Earlier this month a court martial sentenced seven soldiers and officers to 10 years in prison for taking part in a massacre of 10 Rohingya men during a military crackdown in Rakhine state that the UN says may amount to genocide.In both cases, the military did nothing to remedy the rules and policies that enable the abuse of civilians, says Sean Bain, legal consultant for Myanmar at the International Commission of Jurists, a group that promotes human rights and rule of law.The Tatmadaw only admitted to the killings as a form of “damage control” in the face of irrefutable evidence, he adds. “It’s all window dressing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae85702fdc5fb6279f846993d32dabf16e4bf50d/0_149_5153_3093/master/5153.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6065b59d36b6831eafdfb2eb35351059 1240w","title":"labour promises to restore legal aid for housing advice","story":"Shadow justice secretary to announce funding pledge to ‘help tens of thousands of people’Labour has pledged to restore legal aid funding for advice in all housing cases, reversing far-reaching cuts imposed by the government five years ago.The commitment – due to be announced in a speech by the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, on Friday evening – could help up to 50,000 people a year enforce their housing rights. The move comes as the Ministry of Justice concedes that its review of the widely criticised Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) could slip into next year.Since the Grenfell Tower fire, concern has grown about the problems faced by tenants in obtaining justice when pursuing concerns over housing safety. Burgon will tell a meeting at the University of Law in Manchester: “Everyone should have the right to a safe and decent home. But the withdrawal of legal advice in many housing cases has weakened tenants’ rights, which can only benefit rogue landlords.“Restoring this legal aid for housing advice will help tens of thousands of people resolve their housing issues and regain their housing rights. Prevention is better than cure and this policy will help stop problems like damp, leaking roofs or faulty electrics from spiralling out of control and causing tenants even greater misery.” At the previous election, Labour promised to restore legal aid funding for early advice in family law cases, to help victims of domestic abuse and those facing separation and orce.Laspo removed access to legal aid for hundreds of thousands of claimants across large areas of civil law. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a supporter of legal aid.Cuts to criminal legal aid have triggered industrial action by barristers, who are now refusing to accept publicly funded work in protest against years of cuts to their fees. The less-than-glamorous issue of legal aid funding appears to be slowly moving up the political agenda.The number of legal advice cases has plummeted by almost three-quarters, from 573,739 in April 2013 to 147,284, according to Labour. Areas affected include family, discrimination, welfare benefits, employment and housing. Under Laspo’s guidelines, legal advice on housing is not available for disrepair issues unless they have become so serious that they are affecting a resident’s health. Labour estimates its housing advice pledge would cost £9m a year. In 2012-13, housing advice was provided in 85,192 cases by 2016-17 that had fallen to 35,474.A Citizens Advice study has estimated that every pound of legal aid spent on housing advice could potentially save the state £2.34."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b59ce9cae3173f5eec9bd1fc971dcdf49672194/0_19_1450_870/master/1450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=182c3270eae68e240256e95ae320e778 1240w","title":"cant sleep insomnia identity","story":"There’s growing evidence that thinking of yourself as an insomniac is a major part of the problemNote to publishers: in my view, there’s an unfilled gap in the “wellness” market for a book on how sleep isn’t really that important. In contrast to the message relentlessly promoted by lifestyle gurus these days, this book would argue that four hours a night is probably fine, that caffeine before bed is no big deal, and that even severe sleep deprivation poses no real risk of poor performance, health troubles or early death. Admittedly, this might raise certain ethical issues, since that’s not what the science says. But you know what? Unlike all those other books, this one would help people sleep. Because take it from an intermittent bad sleeper: there’s nothing more likely to keep an insomniac up at night, or turn a good sleeper into an insomniac, than being told it’s completely essential they drift off.Actually, the ironies of insomnia are even worse than that, because there’s growing evidence that thinking of yourself as an insomniac – having an “insomnia identity”, in the coinage of the sleep researcher Kenneth Lichstein – is a major part of the problem. It’s not just that such a self-image makes it harder to sleep, though doubtless that’s the case. It’s that having an insomnia identity makes life terrible even if, in reality, you’re getting sufficient sleep. In a review of the research published last year, Lichstein concluded that “non-complaining poor sleepers” – who sleep badly but don’t define themselves as insomniacs – don’t suffer the high blood pressure commonly associated with severe sleeplessness. Meanwhile, “complaining good sleepers” – who get enough shut-eye, but are heavily invested in their alleged insomnia – were essentially as tired, anxious and depressed as those who genuinely didn’t sleep.And the worst part, arguably, is this: with an insomnia identity, seeking help is liable to make things worse. Drag your weary bones to the doctor and she may be willing to prescribe sleeping pills. But apart from the fact that they’re not very effective, and often very addictive, the benefits are likely to be outweighed by the very act of visiting the doctor: by doing so, you’ve doubled down on your insomnia identity, signalling to your subconscious mind that you have an intransigent problem, requiring medical intervention. Reading all this, some chronic insomniacs may protest that I’m making light of their own, far more serious condition, which really is intransigent. Perhaps. But do bear in mind that’s exactly what someone with a strong insomnia identity would say.The root of the problem, as Sasha Stephens explains in her book The Effortless Sleep Method, is that any external crutch on which you lean – not just pills, but herbal remedies and elaborate bedtime rituals, too – risks further eroding your trust in your ability to fall asleep on your own, and it’s that lack of self-trust that is insomnia’s main cause. (Obviously, don’t stop taking prescription drugs without consulting a doctor.) Few things have helped me as much as following one of Stephens’ many recommendations and training myself to remember, upon waking at 2am, that when I have a terrible night, the next day usually isn’t so bad. Once I’m OK with not getting back to sleep, it’s surprisingly hard to stay awake.A Roger Ekirch’s endlessly fascinating 2005 book At Day’s Close, a social history of night-time, argues that pre-industrial people slept in two phases, with an hour awake in between.

Now add the remaining oil, leeks and ginger and saute for about 10 minutes until the leeks have cooked down and are tender.To make the salsa verde, wash the parsley, tear off the stalks, shake dry and blitz in a food processor with the garlic, anchovy and capers. Add the vinegar, pulse-blitz and then pour in the olive oil until you have a green puree. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.Once the leeks and lentils have cooked, mix them together with the vinegar and taste. Season with a little salt and pepper but remember that the salsa verde will season them, too. Serve the lentils in shallow bowls with dollops of goat’s curd, spoonfuls of salsa verde on top, drizzled with a little extra-virgin olive oil and wedges of lemon on the side.These lentils make a great side dish. Saute diced carrot and celery with the leeks and add fresh thyme. You could also leave out the goat’s curd and serve with a grilled lamb chop, steak or fish. Or turn into a soup by whizzing with more stock, topping with garlicky croutons, crisp shards of bacon, or diced, sauteed chorizo.

They and the SNP complained that the BBC spent only about £30m a year on Scottish programming, even though £320m a year was earned from licence fees in Scotland. Ofcom also said the BBC had to pay close attention to the impact the new channel could have on rival broadcasters such as STV, and to whether it was “crowding out” Scottish newspapers and online news services.The corporation plans to hire 80 additional journalists to help produce a one-hour weeknight news and current affairs programme. Scottish newspaper editors complained last year that this would increase competition and involve poaching their staff.Ofcom said it could launch a fresh competition assessment if evidence came to light that the new channel was unfairly affecting its rivals. A final decision on the channel is due from the watchdog by 11 July.The channel will air from noon to midnight, but until 7pm will simulcast BBC Two or feature Scottish political programming.The BBC has faced consistent pressure from SNP leaders such as Alex Salmond to increase Scottish programming. Salmond demanded BBC One broadcast a so-called “Scottish Six” news programme in place of the UK network’s Six O’Clock News.Attacks on the corporation’s Scottish coverage intensified during the 2014 independence referendum, with nationalists accusing it of favouring a “no” vote. “Yes” campaigners demonstrated outside BBC Scotland’s headquarters in Glasgow and in the city centre.

It sounded, from those 30 seconds, as though No Tears Left to Cry might be a ballad, with the 24-year-old turning her pliant vocal range to gospel. It would have made for an appropriate, traditional tribute, if a surprising one considering her previous responses to the tragedy.Despite professional prude Piers Morgan bleating after the attack that she wasn’t demonstrating her grief in the proper way, Grande and manager Scooter Braun swiftly organised One Love Manchester, a vast benefit concert that pulled in performances from artists including Justin Bieber, Liam Gallagher, Coldplay, Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus. It was one of the most joyful, defiant celebrations of pop and the communities it inspires that has ever been staged – so it makes sense that No Tears takes exactly the same attitude.It turns out that the stately sample teased on Thursday was a feint. “Ain’t got no tears left to cry,” Grande sings in classic a style, before switching to a more playful cadence: “So I’m pickin’ it up, pickin’ it up  I’m lovin’, I’m livin’, I’m pickin’ it up.”Heralded by shuffling drums that briefly evoke Jamie xx’s Gosh, the Max Martin production turns into a vibrant celebration of dancing against the odds filled with with knowing nods to pop history: those lush, velveteen synth vamps in the house-inspired verses sound quite a bit like Madonna’s Vogue, the ultimate dancefloor-as-sanctuary banger, and the gospelpop bait-and-switch that recurs in the chorus similarly brings to mind Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer’s 1979 hit No More Tears (Enough Is Enough). It’s an instant earworm – and gratifying, too, to see Grande tackle the single alone rather than with a guest, as she often does.While No Tears is broad enough to enter the canon of timeless sad songs, it contains some satisfyingly specific lyrical barbs. “Don’t matter how, what, where, who tries it  We’re out here vibing,” Grande sings, a line evidently aimed at anyone who thinks such an attack would make people abandon the pursuit of pleasure. She goes further: “We’re way too fly to partake in all this hate,” she sings, maybe implicating opportunists who used the attack to entrench ision. And most satisfyingly of all: “Can’t stop, so shut your mouth,” a recurring kiss-off aimed in the direction of anyone who would judge her – or her fans – for choosing to live, rather than mourn.None of which should be surprising, really, given how Grande seized control of her post-Nickelodeon career, achieved A-list pop stardom without kowtowing to reigning EDM trends, and emerged as a bold voice on feminism and gender double standards. Tradition has never been her style."},{"url":null,"title":"prince cctv footage sinead o connor","story":"Material released after the investigation into the musician’s death also includes a police interview with Sinead O’Connor in which she alleges he was violent to womenA wealth of material gathered as evidence in the investigation into the death of musician Prince has been released, following the ruling that no criminal charges will be filed over his accidental overdose of the opioid painkiller fentanyl. Among the 15GB of data made public by the Carver County sheriff’s office in Minnesota is CCTV footage of Prince visiting the offices of Dr Michael Schulenberg on 20 April 2016, the day before he died aged 57. Dr Schulenberg has since agreed to pay $30,000 (£21,330) in a settlement, after being charged with violating the Controlled Substances Act for writing an Oxycodone prescription for Prince in the name of the musician’s assistant, Kirk Johnson.The archive comprises what attorney Mark Metz described as the “vast majority” of evidence in the case, and contains a police interview with the singer Sinéad O’Connor from 2 May 2016 in which she alleges Prince “used hard drugs commonly”. The Irish musician, who rose to fame in 1990 with the single Nothing Compares 2 U – a song written by Prince – claimed: “I’ve seen him in very frightening conditions after using drugs.” She alleged that he was abusive towards women while intoxicated: “He had been extremely violent to a number of women in his life, including myself, and several women were put in the hospital while Prince was under the effects of these medications.”The data is available to download in its entirety from the Carver County sheriff’s website, and includes footage of Prince’s dead body inside his Paisley Park estate. It also features photographs of Prince’s vast archive of recordings and memorabilia: the images show a vault, secured by a heavy metal door, containing floor-to-ceiling shelves of hand-labelled tape recordings, boxes of VHS tapes and a gold briefcase. Other images show details of the prescription pills found at his home, his guitar collection, his cars, two pet doves, an empty fridge and a freezer filled with Haagen Dazs ice cream. The original version of Nothing Compares 2 U, featuring Prince’s vocals, was made public for the first time on 19 April.

And now there’s a new way to take it all in: in the US, the Record Store Crawl initiative has been set up to explore the wealth of stores in each city. With RSD looming, we thought this could be a model for a survey of the health of record shops in British cities: so, four writers have gone round four cities with some of the UK’s most exciting new DJs and producers, picking out their ultimate record-shopping routes.In London, Debi Ghose – aka Debonair – seems at home in Low Company. Not only is it her local spot, in Hackney Downs, but “their selection is really close what I play, I trust their curation”. Her club and radio sets tend towards the 1980s experimentalism of post-punk, EBM and early house. The chipboard and white walls of Low Company are decorated with 80s industrial music art, its sections are called things like “Strange  Dream  Avant”, and Kenny, the crop-haired Scotsman behind the counter, is playing unwell-sounding outsider punk in between nipping outside for rollups. The shop clearly revels in being on the margins. Not only is it not participating in Record Store Day, it had considered not even opening on the day as it’s the business’s first birthday the day before and they’ll all be hungover. Debi buys a ticket for the birthday party, laughing with Kenny about how many “reprobate” mutual friends will be there.In the quarter-hour it takes us to stroll into bustling Dalston, Debi details her record shop history. At school in Leamington Spa, she “wasn’t a rebel, did well, but got bored and needed something more to focus on”. As a teenage Smashing Pumpkins and Joy Division fan, the local Fopp Records “was heaven to me” at 15 she applied for a job there. She is endlessly thankful that the manager – a DJ known as The Lovely Helen, resident at Brum house institution Wobble – noted her enthusiasm and picked her over other (older, male, ostensibly more qualified) candidates. Behind the counter, she gained confidence talking about music, and expanded her own tastes dramatically: “I had disposable income and cheap records,” she laughs, “I bought so much!”We get to Eldica and are warmly greeted by Annie, who runs the place with her former rave producer husband Andy, and named it for her Trinidadian grandma. In contrast to Low Company’s austere hipness, it’s a piled-up Aladdin’s cave of second-hand vinyl, leaning heavily towards reggae, jazz and soul. “When I joined NTS Radio in 2011,” says Debi, referring to the taste-making online station, “it was great to have this place round the corner, as a connection to the older generation of music lovers already in Dalston. It’s a lovely spot, nothing’s overpriced, but you need three hours to properly dig here.”Sadly we don’t have that, as we need to get to Soho. After university, where she learned presenting and mixing on the uni radio station, Debi had a short stint working in an advertising agency. She was more interested in spending every lunchtime in Soho’s record shops, though, which didn’t go unnoticed: her leaving present from the agency was vouchers for Phonica. Phonica is now the West End’s main dance music hub constant house music plays as established DJs try out 12-inches at the listening posts, and Debi reels off great “in-stores” she’s seen here as her own DJ career began.Nick, who serves us, is a DJ too and runs the well-regarded Meda Fury label as Debi umms and ahhs over a Frankie Goes to Hollywood 12-inch, he shoves a fantastically weird new EP of Japanese electro-dub-folk songs and some Lyonnaise deep house into her listening pile, and passes me a moody electro 12-inch. He’s good: we buy all three, then walk a couple of minutes to Berwick Street, where Reckless hangs on in there, resisting gentrification, unlike most of that strip of secondhand-record shops. There’s no listening posts, only buying on spec, which Debi does often I snap up a Planet Mu acid house record going super cheap.It’s quite a schlep to southeast London with the rush hour starting. (We’re glad at this point that we left Notting Hill’s Honest Jon’s, and Debi’s very favourite shop, Alan’s in East Finchley, off our itinerary.) Sadly, Rat Records in Camberwell is closing as we arrive. So after briefly pressing our noses against the window like kids at a sweetshop, as Debi describes it – “just a really classic record shop, which was my regular place to go when I lived in Brixton” – we get a 171 bus five minutes down the road to Peckham.There’s no fear of Rye Wax being shut, mind. In the basement of Rye Lane’s vast Bussey Building – where grubby raving spaces sit alongside African churches, community groups and yoga studios – it’s also a bar and music venue, open late every night. A DJ is playing Latin jazz as we arrive. “It’s the perfect model of how a shop can be a real hub,” Debi says. “It’s not just a venue, but somewhere I’m guaranteed to meet other DJs and people I know.” Sure enough, it’s buzzing as Debi chats and browses, owner Tom tells me how they’re bypassing RSD releases and instead cutting their own single-copy dubplates. Once Debi has found an intriguing compilation of 80s Catalan DIY rarities, we settle down at a table for a drink, musing on what it must have been like for experimental Spanish musicians under Franco, and taking stock of our day. “It’s hard to know what will happen to record shops,” says Debi. “They’re never going to be what they were before downloading. But if they can turn into places like this, I’m happy!”“This is proper Bristol weather,” grins Omar McCutcheon, the latest star in the city’s long history of experimental dance music. The drizzle is unrelenting as we pace around the Stokes Croft area on our record store crawl, but even though it’s overcast, this cultural nerve centre vividly compensates. Lurid murals loom over the urban sprawl terraced houses are painted in fuschia and lavender. Every other shop is a quirky bar, vegan cafe or vintage clothing emporium. “You’re always getting creative stimulation in Bristol,” says McCutcheon.Under the moniker Batu, the 24-year-old is the next in a long line of Bristol musicians who create new forms from low-end frequencies: his mentors Pinch and Peverelist helped pioneer dubstep’s deep e into techno in the mid-2000s, followed by the latter’s cutting-edge collective Livity Sound, and now Batu has taken the baton and is veering off in an even more abstract direction. With his label and night Timedance, he pairs sound-system culture with techno to create sculptural club punishers that fizz with lambent ideas and curious samples, as do the young local artists he releases such as Bruce, Ploy, Lurka and Giant Swan.Idle Hands is the shop where the city’s new wave congregates. It’s a no-frills dance music specialist run by Chris Farrell, with well-curated racks of new 12-inches ning the UK underground. “It’s very important to me – a meeting spot, a hub of Bristol music,” says McCutcheon as he spots an old Bass Clef tune he’s been after for ages and locks straight into some headphones.Idle Hands is one of the new boutique record shops that have sprung up here in the past few years, after a wave of closures. Farrell says Record Store Day doesn’t make much of a difference to the shop in terms of sales, but because all the pressing plants are booked up with limited edition novelty items such as translucent green vinyl Doctor Who soundtracks, new stock doesn’t come through as readily in the weeks leading up to it. McCutcheon still finds a wedge of vinyl he wants, including a compilation of early experiments by Japanese musician Kuniyuki Takahashi, which recently came out on a leftfield label he admires, Music from Memory.McCutcheon is relatively new to the city, having moved here four years ago from Oxfordshire for the creative music technology course at Bath Spa University (“dubstep finishing school”, Farrell quips). His growing touring schedule means he doesn’t get as much time to shop locally as he’d like. Which may explain why we can’t seem to find next stop The Centre for Better Grooves. It was started by the founder of budget music chain Fopp but is, in contrast, “a wallet beater”, jokes McCutcheon. We pass Elevator Sound, a sleek shrine to modular synths, and bump into a postman who is by night a psychedelic DJ and points us in the right direction. Soon we are riffling through a luxurious number of jazz reissues with cosmic covers. Past a pair of congas, there’s a sizeable vintage rock section, but McCutcheon is less interested in that. “I’m more of a sound than a songs person,” he says, eyeing up a selection labelled “FX” that is ripe for sampling.Next we head to Wanted’s tiny record trailer, down a cobbled path in St Nick’s Market. McCutcheon immediately makes a beeline for the dancehall crates, and waxes lyrical over the Greensleeves Rhythm Album series, one of the longest-running of its kind, where various artists interpret the same rhythm. He has also recently been collecting reggae and dub 45s, the hub for which is Payback, around the corner. Paul Craine has been running this fir-green stall for 20 years and it’s where you can find Prince Buster 7-inches for £1, or more contemporary roots releases from Protoje or Chronixx. Payback is a window into the origins of Bristol’s obsession with making music so deep it can rattle your ribcage. The area’s African Caribbean sound-system heritage has laid the foundation for the subsequent genres of weighty, deep electronic music that have come through its streets: trip-hop, jungle, dubstep. For McCutcheon, that culture is also “integral to my identity. Living here, having family of Caribbean descent and growing up with reggae – all these ideas link back to where I see myself in the world.” No matter what record shop you’re in or producer you talk to, bass, says McCutcheon, is what unites the city: “It’s so ingrained in everything.”“Technooooo,” comes the jovial response from Henrietta Smith-Rolla when asked what section she gravitates towards in a record shop. “Always the techno section. I never go in with any idea of what I want to buy. I like not knowing.”Over coffee in Eastern Bloc, a cafe, venue and record shop in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, the hiss of the coffee machine whistles above the thudding techno pulsing from the speakers. “I’ve been doing music for over a decade but I didn’t know this was in me,” the 37-year-old says about Afrodeutsche, a project born two years ago whilst searching for her father. She learned that her Ghanaian roots also stretched into Russia and Germany, and thus found herself with a newfound identity and family history. The name, translating as African-German, was an epiphany that linked to the already eclectic music she was creating. “I just had this huge connection to it straight away. I never expected to realise myself artistically in this world.” Afrodeutsche blends techno, house, electro and anything else Smith-Rolla feels like throwing in, based on intuition. “Everything I write is always a translation of what’s going on with me. Even my NTS shows are just based on how I’m feeling,” she says, referring to her monthly radio show.As we walk upstairs and the throb of the beat grows louder, Smith-Rolla doesn’t nosee into the techno section but instead is greeted with a pile of 12-inches, recommended by Ben Marsden, the head house and techno buyer. This level of personal curation and assistance is crucial for smaller shops, he tells me. “I go in spurts of buying records,” Smith-Rolla says. “I’m not in shops all the time but when I am, I’m usually here.” She also buys online from places like Discogs and Boomkat. “I think record shops have got kinder,” she tells me, in-between playing Umwelt and Maelstrom on the listening turntable. “There’s been a change in how women are looked at and observed. There’s no surprise any more when a woman walks in to buy a Detroit techno record. I would get nervous going into shops when I was younger, but things have become more welcoming.”While the music of Afrodeutsche is deeply personal and emotional – she describes it as “dark optimism” – when Smith-Rolla DJs, it’s all about getting loose and dismantling the seriousness of some in the techno world. “I like to have fun. I don’t see myself as a DJ my sets are …” she stops mid-sentence and makes a series of explosive, chaotic noises. “As far as I’m concerned, anyone can do this. There isn’t a wall between us. There’s no bravado, it’s just fun times. Manchester is the kind of place that if you’re into good stuff then you’ll be invited to do good things it’s a small city and everyone is connected.” As we move around the corner onto Oldham Street on a bustling afternoon and into Piccadilly Records, Smith-Rolla shows her goofy side as I look over to see her doing the downward escalator routine, disappearing behind a rack of records, cackling away.Smith-Rolla lived in Devon and London before Manchester, and is positively glowing about her time here. “Manchester is a beautiful place because it is nurturing without question. It’s here where I felt I had complete freedom to make stuff.” This freedom to create has seen her work with 808 State’s Graham Massey, score a reinterpretation of the 1992 documentary Baraka, and become part of GRRRL, a group assembled by In Place of War, a project that works to mobilise and connect artists in conflict zones. The eight-piece, and their “insane, pure energy” live performance, recently played the Commonwealth Games’ closing ceremony.In Vinyl Exchange, she takes an armful of records to the counter. The man behind it sincerely asks how her music is going, telling her he’s heard good things about her live shows. On the way out, she reflects on this sense of community and support she finds in the record shops, clubs and people of Manchester: “I’m surrounded by encouragement. That’s what Manchester does, it makes you want to be involved and help people out.”Cratedigging and cardio may seem like two diametrically opposed pastimes but in Glasgow it is possible to combine both. Palais de Danse – a cramped but colourful garret stacked with preloved vinyl – lies behind a doorway on Sauchiehall Street. You just have to make it up four narrowing flights of stairs first. This is where Kenny Grieve and Dan Lurinsky of Dixon Avenue Basement Jams (DABJ) – local label owners and in-demand DJs – want to begin their Glasgow record shop crawl. Even on a miserable Friday morning, the elevated view from the fire escape makes it feel like an appropriate place to survey the city’s music retail scene, once we get our breath back. “Some workout, that,” Grieve says to Dennis, Palais de Danse’s wiry proprietor. “Try doing it with a box of records,” he replies, “it’s murder.” There are deep bins of house and techno, while a lone box of dubstep sits atop an ancient safe. Grieve and Lurinsky rifle through the stock with the flowing fingers of veteran vinyl spelunkers their eventual haul includes a hidden gem from Dave Clarke’s 90s techno imprint Magnetic North. Palais de Danse is one of a new wave of independent vinyl shops that have opened in Glasgow in the past three years. The next stop, Rubadub, is more of an institution: since 1992, it has been a hub for DJs looking to stock up on desirable new imports, upgrade equipment or just talk shop with fellow devotees. While some stores host a chaotic decor of ripped posters and countless club flyers, Rubadub has always been stripped-back, cool, clinical. A recent interior redesign has reinforced the monochrome look but retained the shop’s signature feature: a tightly-wound cast-iron spiral staircase leading up to a cluster of listening decks. Lurinsky is a longstanding Rubadub employee, and says practically all of the staff were – like him – regular customers first, drawn to the communal vibe. While the shop may not officially take part in Record Store Day (“I think most people feel it’s all got a bit commercial,” says Lurinsky) there will still be a day-long party on 21 April, to christen the refit. Next, we head south of the Clyde to visit Otherside, a narrow, seductive emporium that has offered both second-hand vinyl and eccentric vintage objects since 2015. JD Twitch, of Glasgow’s venerable Optimo club night, once offloaded so much excess vinyl here he had his own section it is perhaps the only place in the city where it is possible to pick up a happy hardcore classic from DJ Mental Theo and a Victorian carpet beater in the same trip. Having been invited to rummage through some unsorted stock, Lurinsky is elated to find a record by Detroit legend Claude Young he has coveted for years. Grieve somehow emerges with a hookah pipe and a chipped plaster statue of the Virgin Mary, decor for the new DABJ office-cum-studio by the riverside. Their label name was inspired by a raucous mid-2000s in-the-know after-hours party staged in a crudely converted basement flat on Dixon Avenue, and the final stop on our crawl is only a few streets away from that spiritual birthplace. Some Great Reward, a cosy cafe that doubles as a physical outpost for an online record store, opened earlier this month. In the main space, new releases like Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s Sex and Food are displayed on the wall with smart, snappy recommendation notes. Over coffee and a Bakewell slice, Grieve and Lurinsky tot up how much they have spent – almost £100, not including the Virgin Mary – and reflect on how the Glasgow music scene has waxed and waned over the years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78144587dd3cb9d61989c3bd8a22c967be117aab/121_118_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0ed4054d04696f12e46803fe4cb30ef2 1240w","title":"amber rudd boasted harsher immigration strategy leak reveals","story":"Exclusive: home secretary told PM she would give officials greater ‘teeth’ to deport migrantsAmber Rudd privately boasted to the prime minister that she would give immigration officials greater “teeth” to hunt down and deport thousands more illegal migrants and accelerate the UK’s deportation programme, a leaked private letter has revealed.In a robust private memo to Theresa May just months before long-settled Windrush migrants were threatened with deportation, Rudd set out her “ambitious” plan to increase removals and focus officials on “arresting, detaining and forcibly removing illegal migrants” while “ruthlessly” prioritising Home Office resources to that programme .The letter was sent on 30 January 2017. A few months later Paulette Wilson, a grandmother from Jamaica who had lived in Britain for 50 years, became the first of more than 20 Windrush migrants to tell the Guardian how they were facing deportation or a loss of rights to health, housing and work because of Home Office policy.The aggressive language and tone of Rudd’s approach to immigration enforcement emerged after the home secretary attempted to blame officials in her own department for the Windrush scandal in which it emerged up to 50,000 mostly Commonwealth migrants were facing possible deportation despite having lived in Britain for decades. Rudd claimed in parliament on Monday she was “concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”.That appeared to be an attempt to suggest she had inherited a hardline system from May, who as home secretary announced a policy to create “a really hostile environment for illegal migrants” across government departments.But in the private memo, Rudd said she believed in the fundamental importance of that hostile environment agenda, which she referred to as the “compliant environment”, an attempted rebranding of the policy by ministers a few months earlier.The culture that agenda inspired has been widely blamed for members of the Windrush-era generation being threatened in recent months with deportation and denied access to housing, healthcare and jobs.In 2016, 39,626 people were deported or left the UK voluntarily, according to the UK Migration Observatory, but Rudd’s letter to May indicates a home secretary determined to make her mark and toughen up even further an immigration enforcement regime which uses liveried vans that have become an increasingly common sight in areas with large migrant communities.Rudd told May her proposals to reduce the overall illegal population had been “informed by the review that you commissioned whilst home secretary”. She concluded: “Everything I have outlined above is aimed not just at radically reshaping and refocusing immigration enforcement but at increasing the public’s confidence in our immigration system.”Nowhere in the memo does Rudd mention the possible human cost of getting her immigration policy wrong.Rudd told May that her strategy was “informed by the review that you commissioned as home secretary”. On Thursday, Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, said May’s Home Office had pursued “nasty politics” over immigration.Rudd’s memo was sent as the government stepped up its attempts to bring net migration down into the tens of thousands. The previous year, the figure was 248,000. Four months earlier, May rebooted the government’s immigration taskforce, chairing a committee of 12 cabinet ministers – including the three key Brexit supporters, Liam Fox, Boris Johnson and David Davies – to ensure a new regime was introduced to slash the net number of arrivals into the UK to below 100,000 a year.Other measures she told May about included obtaining biometric data from countries such as Pakistan, which she said could be “a potential game changer in terms of the numbers we can remove”. She asked for the prime minister’s help to persuade the leaders of other countries to supply such data.Rudd also said she wanted illegal migrants who were being housed in detention centres before removal to either be sent back to their origin country, released into the community on licence, or tagged to free up beds for the new people that her immigration enforcement team will be picking up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3ee66de6b6c9c227cd6fb555408c3d1e2c9b8ff/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70c9fbdcc009e8ff530c710697ec4e52 1240w","title":"its time to stop believing in these magic brexit solutions","story":"UK’s unlikely proposals to solve Irish border question leaves Brussels wondering if customs union may be most realistic optionFrom the minute the UK government first proposed its idea last August of maintaining “invisible borders” after Brexit, the convoluted plan was dismissed as “magical thinking” by EU officials. What has changed this week is that the time for pretending otherwise has run out.First, Downing Street reassurances were rejected on Wednesday by the House of Lords, where peers voted by a majority of 123 to push Britain toward a customs union – arguing it was the only practical alternative to wrecking the Irish peace process with a hard border.Now a fresh account of the latest withering exchange with officials in Brussels has made the front page of the Daily Telegraph, making it impossible for Conservative ministers to maintain the illusion any longer that the EU is being steadily persuaded to change its mind. If the government wants to avoid a more serious rebellion in the House of Commons when the customs union question returns for a vote after local elections in May, it has to convince anxious Tory backbenchers that it is on track to reach agreement at the EU summit in June. Reading in their house newspaper that the UK alternatives were this week subjected to a “systematic and forensic annihilation” and “detailed and forensic rebuttal” creates a cognitive dissonance that no amount of Downing Street spin can hide. “It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work,” an EU source told the Telegraph. “None of them.”It was telling that the British response to the story on Friday – though insisting things weren’t quite that bad – was to acknowledge that the other side was briefing aggressively against them and their scheme, which is never a good sign if you are trying to pretend everything is tickety-boo.For some, this may still come as a surprise. After all, the EU had shown a willingness to collude in postponing a showdown ahead of the previous summit in March. It is possible that the hardball tactics now are a prelude to another last-minute fudge in time for the next one.The problem however is that the two UK customs proposals in question would require unprecedented levels of trust and co-operation – possibly even more so than the current arrangements between member states. Unlike, for example, the recent dispute over the post-Brexit financial settlement, there is no point simply negotiating through gritted teeth until both sides wearily agree to put the issue behind them. Without lasting faith across the EU that this will work, it almost certainly won’t.Both UK proposals require the EU to suspend more than its innate scepticism. They also require Brussels to be willing to turn a blind eye to a substantial amount of future rule-breaking and potential smuggling in order to get the British government out of a hole.The first, and less ambitious, of the two proposals outlined in August, is a “streamlined customs arrangement”, whereby the onus is on businesses to police their own trade activity and report imports and exports that should be subject to duty. In Northern Ireland, where the highly integrated farming industry makes even this look too onerous, whole swathes of smaller traders would be exempted entirely from complying with normal customs rules.If this isn’t enough of an ask to make of the bureaucrats in Brussels, the UK would actually prefer a more ambitious option, a “new customs partnership”, to be implemented. In this scenario, the UK pretends (“mirrors” to use the technical term) that it still is in a customs union with the EU. This means not just collecting duties on overseas imports, as all members do now, but also tracking all goods after they arrive to make sure whether they are destined for UK or EU markets.As bewildered officials once again pointed out in Brussels this week, this requires a number of heroic assumptions for it to work. Firstly, the EU would need to trust a non-member state to police its most sensitive enforcement mechanisms. Secondly, it would need to impose red tape on businesses the likes of which has never been seen, even in the imagination of the most fervent Eurosceptics. Finally, it is all likely to cost a fortune in new systems, on both sides of the border.At the best of times, either of these two options would be a stretch: turn a blind eye, or recreate a bureaucratic nightmare many times more complex than that which exists today.But these are not the best of times, to put it mildly. Mistrust already abounds on all sides. The Irish government, in particular, fears the UK is not serious about its proposals but merely using them as a temporary sop to placate those worried about the peace process.More importantly the EU senses an even more significant victory could be looming. If it can persuade the government’s own MPs that there is no hope of British proposals coming to pass, then remaining in a customs union is now a realistic fall-back solution. Downing Street acceptance of the need for “close regulatory alignment” suggests continued single market membership may not be far behind either.Both would be an anathema to Brexit true-believers, but a relief to business, Brussels and much of Westminster. By playing hardball now, the worst-case scenario for the EU is that Britain becomes like Norway – a compliant, satellite state. By pinning all its hopes on “magical” proposals, which fail to emerge when the wand is waved, the UK may have left itself with nowhere else to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ccd3368d7f7c94d85c5b40844647072056455f/0_41_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d3da72bd8c3ce2ca9d80dcaf52bb7bfa 1240w","title":"ed smith confirmed england cricket selector job too good to turn down","story":"Ed Smith, the former cricketer, broadcaster and journalist, has been confirmed as England’s new national selector and will now head up a restructured scouting system for identifying the best players in the country.The 40-year-old replaces James Whitaker in the top role and will be given licence to appoint a deputy to sit alongside himself and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, on a new three-man panel that picks the men’s national teams.Smith said: “I was very happy with what I was doing previously but the chance to be at the forefront of this development in English cricket was too good an opportunity to turn down. Selection and talent ID have always fascinated me and I’ve explored extensively how they are evolving.”This move to shake up the selection process, which will see a network of discipline-specific scouts deployed in the county game and an increased emphasis on analytics, has been led by the director of England cricket, Andrew Strauss, who played with Smith at Middlesex.Strauss said: “It’s about us getting better quality information and making sure our decision-making is as clear and robust as possible. Ed will come to this role with fresh ideas and his input will help us implement a structure that we hope can become world-leading, not just in cricket but in sport generally.”Smith, who played three Tests for England in 2004 and 191 first-class matches during a 12-year playing career at Middlesex and Kent, will step down from his roles as a Test Match Special commentator and Sunday Times columnist.As well as writing for the New Statesman, Smith was previously a columnist for ESPNCricinfo but his time with the website ended in 2016 after an article on stress in sport that editor Sambit Bal said “bore striking similarities” to elements of a piece in the Economist by another writer.Angus Fraser and Mick Newell, the respective cricket directors at Middlesex and Nottinghamshire, are expected to now leave their part-time selector roles, with Strauss keen to remove perceived conflicts of interest in the set-up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f04f755acbde27bb3ce7b7bd2ff082135a7dfc/0_0_1235_1231/master/1235.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ce0c99caac80aac8bb6c8eb1a6c7e46e 1240w","title":"gawain jones luke mcshane nigel short mixed results","story":"England’s small group of grandmasters who compete abroad have been in action recently, sparking some impressive results but also a couple of truly disastrous moments.The European inidual championship in Batumi, Georgia, clashed with the world title candidates in Berlin so had a low profile. In previous years the event has been dominated by Russia and Eastern Europe, and the only two gold medalists from the West were both former Soviet players.The field was packed with highly rated grandmasters so that the British champion, Gawain Jones, was seeded only 30th, and Luke McShane 34th. The English duo defied the odds, were up with the leaders throughout, and at the end finished in a big group which tied for second on 811, half a point behind the Croatian gold medallist, Ivan Saric.Jones, who was unbeaten, and McShane, who lost just once, were placed fourth and sixth on tiebreaks. No English player has ever won a medal at this championship, but Jones and McShane improved on all their predecessors and comfortably reached their primary target, two of the 23 qualifying places for the valuable 128-player 2019 knockout World Cup.The British champion Jones went on to the Dubai Open, where he was again unbeaten and finished sixth on 6.59. Then to the Sharjah Masters, where besides the usual corps of experienced GMs a flock of teenage talents entered from India, Iran and Uzbekistan. The prodigy generation is improving fast. Iran’s Parham Maghsoodloo, 17, won with 89, the world’s current youngest GM, Nodibirek Abdusattorov, 13, beat a 2700-rated opponent, while Jones suffered in a bizarre second-round finish.Jones wore down the Uzbek talent Javokhir Sindarov, 13, and slowly squeezed his way to an ending of two bishops against a knight. After a marathon 122 moves they reached Kf6, Ng2 v Kg4, Bs c6 and d2 where White’s g2 knight is stranded with no escape square and will be captured next turn. But the last capture was on move 72, so that Sindarov in this resignable position successfully claimed a draw under the 50-move rule.Thus Jones fell for an obscure rule and faded in the last three rounds, but what occurred to Nigel Short at the Bangkok Open this week was much worse. The former world title challenger is a regular at Thailand’s annual event, won it in 2017, began this week with 3.54, and as the No\u0026nbsp2 seed looked set for a strong performance. In round five Short steadily outplayed India’s youngest and newest IM, 11-year-old D\u0026nbspGukesh, and reached a won ending two pawns up.Then, disaster. Short gave a rook check, forgot to press his clock and after a few minutes his flag fell. He wrote on Twitter: “Lose with dignity\u0026nbsp… is a bit hard when your opponent is fully aware that you have not pressed your clock and jumps up and down with glee the moment your flag falls.”In one of the quickest GM wins at Sharjah, India’s Baskian Adhiban, who had the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, on the verge of defeat at Wijk 2017, crushed a 2700-rated Ukrainian in only 21 moves.The opening, a Caro-Kann where Black follows a Vishy Anand 3…c5 strategy, is level until White’s 12 Nc3? (12 c5 keeps control) gives Black the opportunity for piece activity by 13…Qxf6! since White is firing blanks on the a1-h8 diagonal.Shamkir, with Carlsen, and the US championship, with his challenger Fabiano Caruana, both continue this weekend and can be viewed live and free online with move-by-move grandmaster and computer commentary.

England believe they are entitled to pick the player regardless, in accordance with World Rugby regulations, but should the NZR accept his plea it would avoid a drawn-out dispute.As revealed by the Guardian earlier this week, Jones has permission to pick the New Zealand-born Hurricanes flanker – who qualifies through his parents – despite the RFU’s policy of not picking players based outside England. If Shields, who is joining Wasps next season, does go to South Africa he would return to the Hurricanes and play up to six Super Rugby matches before arriving at the Premiership high-flyers.Tew initially threatened to block any attempt from England to select him, insisting Shields has a clause in his contract which means he can only play for New Zealand teams. England meanwhile, believe World Rugby’s regulation nine – which governs player release – means the flanker is available to them. Tew reiterated his view that World Rugby regulations do not apply but, in what appears to be a softening of his stance, told the NZ Herald: “He’s contracted to New Zealand until the end of Super Rugby and so the World Rugby regulations don’t apply per se because he’s committed himself to New Zealand, but he is a long-standing and loyal servant of the game and has put a request in.“There’s no point in not acknowledging that Brad has been a very, very good servant of the game for a long period of time. If he had been picked for the All Blacks we wouldn’t be having this conversation but he hasn’t made that cut and is now taking a different direction. We’re not going to muck around. There’s no point in taking weeks when he and England need a decision faster than that.”World Rugby is yet to comment since Tew’s initial threat to block any approach for Shields, but when asked last week if the Hurricanes would be obliged to release him if England wanted to select him in June, the governing body told the Guardian that was “absolutely the case”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb8e5cda423e1d48ce94fdcc2e256bd5ab3a32b5/0_120_5011_3007/master/5011.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8b54f861b102475a1dfea9dd3e48dee 1240w","title":"scarlets leinster james davies interview rugby union","story":"Not since Llanelli’s fabled win over the All Blacks in 1972 has west Wales felt so much love for its local rugby heroes. At last there is modern-day competition for sepia-tinted legends such as Ray Gravell and Phil Bennett, particularly if the Scarlets become the first Welsh team or region to win Europe’s ultimate club title. Even making the final at Leinster’s expense would out-rank all other Welsh efforts in the past 21 years.Whatever happens, last season’s Pro12 champions are already admired for their infectiously positive offloading style and, particularly in one inidual’s case, for bringing a smile to everyone’s face. To say James ‘Cubby Boi’ Davies is a popular figure is an understatement: if anyone embodies the Scarlets’ joie de vivre it is the 27-year-old younger brother of the Lions centre, Jon “Fox” Davies.Even at breakfast time on a wet midweek morning, the irrepressible Cubby (his parents ran the Fox \u0026amp Hounds pub in Bancyfelin, hence the siblings’ nicknames) is magnificent value. How many other top sportsmen would happily recall the drunken night in Las Vegas when his knuckles were tattooed for a bet, discuss his dog eating his lucky underpants or admit to being only the fourth-best rugby player from his home village near Carmarthen? If the openside flanker’s breakdown work in Dublin is as sharp as his comic timing, Leinster will be right up against it.Cubby’s guiding mantra – “If you’re going to be a bear be a Grizzly” – usually means he responds well to big occasions. He was brilliant for Great Britain’s medal-winning sevens team in the Rio Olympics and has never been one for holding back. “For years I’ve thought like that. What’s the point of being someone who sits in a corner and no-one knows who they are? It works for some people but I guess I just chose differently. When the big games are happening and the bright lights are on, that’s when I like to shine. Growing up in the pub my hero was Prince Naseem Hamed. I loved how he used to put on a show for everybody. When I was seven or eight I asked for a pair of his gly shorts for Christmas but Santa never came up with the goods.”Time spent around Davies junior is rarely dull. According to his brother, he “thinks he’s a rock star now” but not everyone always sees the funny side. His first cap against Italy last month should probably have happened some years earlier while his tattooed fists caused disquiet at home: “Mum came round pretty quickly but Dad took a bit longer. I remember showing him for the first time and all he said was: ‘There we are then.’ He didn’t speak to me for seven days. I think he was thinking about what job I could do after rugby. It’ll probably have to be something involving gloves – maybe a dentist?” At least it has raised his profile. “I call myself a marketing genius now. Subconsciously I think I always knew what I was doing.” Really? “Very subconsciously.”All of which prompts a serious question: would he have won more caps had he been a duller bloke? Breaking off from discussing his pet collie Desmond’s appetite for underpants – “He’s just had my training socks as well” – he is fairly sure he knows the answer.“Yeah, potentially. I don’t know if that’s been the case but, if it is, I’m quite happy with the route I’ve taken. At the end of the day I’d rather have fun and eventually achieve my goal rather than be more boring and have a lot more caps.”The deceptively-strong Cubby is far more committed than he lets on. As with the young Neil Back, there has been scepticism from those who expect top-class opensides to be a certain size and shape. “I’ve been doubted throughout my career. Since I was 16 people have said: ‘He’s not big enough.’ My brother’s a great player but, as a big lad back then, it would only take one game to convince someone. It would take me 20 games.” Escaping the shadows of Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric and Josh Navidi to win his first cap, therefore, was a deeply satisfying moment. “It felt like I’d earned it. I enjoy myself but I work hard as well. To play the way I do you have to be fit. I work my butt off in the off-season.”It also means his currently-injured brother, the great Delme Thomas and another locally-reared Lion, Mike Phillips, now have lively company in the village hall of fame. Cubby has a theory about the origins of this impressive production line –“Delme’s of an age when he might have been going round knocking on doors at night” – but the Fox \u0026amp Hounds also offered a perfect athletic breeding ground. “Luckily the pub had a nice big park area which was our back garden. There were no iPhones or iPads so me and my brother would just be out playing football and rugby. That’s where my skill levels come from.” Who usually won? “Silly question. I used to run rings around him. Whenever anyone scored a screamer in football they had to lie on their back like Paul Gascoigne and be squirted with water bottles. Good times.”The post-match celebrations will be equally joyous if Scarlets repeat last season’s Pro 12 semi-final win over Leinster, when the versatile Davies was redeployed on the wing after Steff Evans was red-carded. He filled the same role – “I should have two contracts, shouldn’t I?” – against La Rochelle last month and will be among this weekend’s key figures alongside Tadhg Beirne, Ken Owens, Leigh Halfpenny et al. “Because a lot of the core players are from this part of the world you don’t get big egos or city slickers. I think that’s why everyone gets on so well. There are no cliques and we play for each other.”The other secret ingredient is the Scarlets’ collective desire to give it a real go. “It just allows players to express themselves a bit more. There’s so much talent in these boys when they’re relaxed.” Would winning in Europe mean even more than his Olympic silver medal or his Welsh cap? “These are my best mates. To achieve that kind of landmark with them would probably be the pinnacle.” The boys of ’72 will take some emulating but their successors are not done yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3695e0eddeb72d63261c4f6d7a9b9e9b9f9f17a/123_85_4120_2472/master/4120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dbd75bd12750132aaebb291f4fc76ada 1240w","title":"county cricket yorks v notts somerset v worcestershire and more live","story":"Tea at Headingley, where Yorkshire are closing in on a batting point. They are 1988, with Andrew Hodd unbeaten on 55. If he, Jack Brooks and Ben Coad can somehow get the score up to 250, this could be a good score. Notts certainly didn’t bowl as well this afternoon, not making use of conditions – more swing than seam. It was pretty similar in the first 15 minutes of play this morning before they found their range. Ed Barnard, the mini-Woakes of Worcestershire, rocked Somerset in the afternoon session with his first five-wicket haul in first class cricket. While Matt Renshaw enjoyed a perfect debut – he became the first Somerset batsman to make a century since Alviro Petersen in 2013 and the 14th man to achieve this feat – Barnard, with his lively seamers, tormented the rest of the batsmen. Barnard finished with 5-49 while Somerset, despite Renshaw’s best efforts, limped to 202 all out.Barnard found a flicker of movement in the air and off a green pitch, albeit one that is beginning to lose some if its verdancy. Meanwhile the more familiar of the Somerset batsmen looked flaky against Worcestershire’s four-pronged pace attack.Renshaw has arrived at Taunton eager to please his new employers and to gain vital experience in case he is selected for next summer’s Ashes series. On this evidence he has a fine chance of being on that tour. This was an archetypal test for an Australian playing his first first-class innings in this country with regular movement available off a juicy April pitch, though as a kid in Yorkshire Renshaw played plenty of cricket in Sheffield alongside Joe Root.Renshaw reached his century with an emphatic lofted drive off Travis Head, who bowled the solitary over of spin in the match so far. Soon after he was stranded but contented, having proven his worth to his new colleagues at the first opportunity.Renshaw would not be here without those shenanigans with the ball by the Australians in Cape Town last month, which had so many consequences. One of the smaller ones was that Cameron Bancroft’s contract with Somerset was terminated and he was replaced by Renshaw. It may be that Somerset have been done an unwitting favour by David Warner and Steve Smith.Ed Smith, the former cricketer, broadcaster and journalist, has been confirmed as England’s new national selector and will now head up a restructured scouting system for identifying the best players in the country, writes Ali Martin.The 40-year-old replaces James Whitaker in the top role and will be given licence to appoint a deputy to sit alongside himself and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, on a new three-man panel that picks the men’s national teams. You can read the full story here.Essex 150 all out against Lancashire at Chelmsford, including Peter Siddle’s 33 from number 10. Joe Mennie led the way with three wickets for Lancs, while Onions, Clark and Bailey all adding a couple apiece.They are the third of three teams to have already been bowled out today, the other two being in Division Two. Durham were 91 all out against Kent, who are 884. I can’t see that one going to the final session of day four. Northants were bowled out for 147, with Warwickshire 140 in reply. Here, Yorkshire are edging towards a batting point thanks largely to Andrew Hodd. He has 47 of 1847.Luke Fletcher, the pick of the Notts attack, has taken his second and third wickets in the last half hour or so, with Yorkshire now 1617. Jack Leaning was caught at second slip and Tim Bresnan lbw. Andrew Hodd is Yorkshire’s biggest hope of a recovery – he has 37. Wickets continue to tumble around the country, with Essex 1509 against Lancashire. In fact, only Surrey, Kent and Sussex have had what you would describe as a successful day with the bat. The title defence hasn’t started so well for Essex. Frustrated off the field here at Headingley last week, they are being frustrated on it this week at Chelmsford. They are currently 1058 against Lancashire, including two wickets apiece for Graham Onions and Jordan Clark, who has picked up his wickets either side of lunch. Australian Joe Mennie has claimed three-for … he was their standout performer in the Notts defeat by all accounts. No further alarm for Yorkshire after lunch, who are 135-5 with Andrew Hodd on 28 and Jack Leaning on 12. They have shared 42 unbroken. Talk about a hectic morning. I make that 37 wickets falling before lunch across the country, with 23 of those being in Division Two. Mind you, I certainly didn’t get an A in GCSE maths, so please don’t shoot the messenger. Here at Headingley, Yorkshire are in a spot of both at 1075, losing two of those to Jake Ball – loose shots from Alex Lees and Gary Ballance. The hosts have had their moments, however, through Adam Lyth’s eye-catching 45 and a good looking 22 from teenager Harry Brook before he was yorked by Luke Wood’s left-arm seam. Much like Yorkshire, it has been a pretty frustrating start to the campaign for champions Essex. Washed out at Headingley last week, they are four down for 65 against last season’s runners up Lancashire. Jordan Clark removed Ravi Bopara on the cusp of lunch.Much more sedate at the Oval and Taunton, where Surrey are 832 against Hampshire and Somerset are 1023 against Worcestershire. Down in Division Two, most of the action has come at the Riverside, where Durham have been bowled out for 91 by Kent. Five for New Zealander Matt Henry and a cheeky three-for for Darren Stevens. Northants, Sussex and Derbyshire all three down in their respective games, while Gloucestershire are 864 against Glamorgan at Bristol.Somehow Somerset took lunch contentedly. They were 1053 which is a fine outcome for them. The pitch was green, the ball darted around and vital catches were spilt. In the seventh over Somerset were 72, with old Trescothick and young Byrom back in the sheds (sorry, not been long back from New Zealand).Steve Magoffin, who has a fine record at Taunton, was making the ball talk. Batting was a trial despite a cloudless sky. James Hildreth in particular was in skittish, scatty mood. He clipped one straight ball from Magoffin for six over square leg and failed to middle anything else for about half an hour. On 13 he offered a tall skier from a leading edge. Keeper Cox, normally so reliable, circled as Hildreth headed for the pavilion he barely laid a glove on the ball. When Hildreth was on 20 he edged a fine delivery from Josh Tongue, offering another tricky yet routine catch to the keeper and the ball fell to ground. There was another six from Hildreth from an upper cut, but he could not quite make it to lunch. He was caught at slip for 48 just before lunch.Meanwhile Matt Renshaw, the Australian opener and a late replacement for Cameron Bancroft, proceeded in more orthodox style. Not always pretty, not always at ease on such a green surface, he battled impressively. Eventually he was clipping the ball off his hip with increasing certainty and delivering a few meaty on drives. He was 45 not out at the break. Over 2000 spectators are engrossed and enthralled by this old fashioned game.Wickets tumbling up and down the country, including a fourth here at Headingley – Adam Lyth lbw to Harry Gurney for a breezy 45, including a pulled six off the other left-armer, Luke Wood. If Yorkshire can take anything from this morning, it’s that their teenager Harry Brook has settled nicely at the crease and has 22 of 914. Elsewhere, champions Essex are 543 against Lancashire at Chelmsford, with Tom Westley the latest to go to Tom Bailey for 17. Other wickets for Onions and Mennie. Yorkshire are in a spot of bother now, at 473. Gary Ballance was the latest to fall for a nine-ball duck, caught at point off Jake Ball. Having seen Alex Lees caught at third slip following a loose shot to Ball, Ballance steered a short ball straight to point. Teenager Harry Brook has come in and played a lovely back foot punch through the covers to get off the mark, however. Adam Lyth is with him on 25. Jeepers, Durham are 466 against Kent! Wickets everywhere but Grace Road in the opening 45 minutes of the day, with Sussex 17-0 against the Foxes. Surrey are 282 against Hampshire at the Oval, having lost Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick lbw to Fidel Edwards for four and five. Oh, hang on, just as I finished that paragraph, the full house is complete as Luke Wells is caught behind off Leicester’s seam bowling all-rounder Ben Raine. Here at Headingley, we have just seen a second wicket go, that of Che Pujara – or Steve to his Yorkie mates – lbw to Luke Fletcher for two. It’s 362. Early action at Durham as they lose two in the third over to Kent’s overseas New Zealander Matt Henry, leaving them at 42. That has included Durham’s overseas Aiden Markram lbw for an eight-ball duck. Will Smith, bowled, followed him back to the hutch. Quiet but steady start here by Yorkshire, who are 140 in the fourth. Ed Smith, meanwhile, has been announced as England’s new national selector, replacing James Whitaker.A cloudless sky, Quantocks fully visible and the Marcus Trescothick Stand is almost full at 10.40am. It seems to be farewell – or at least au revoir – to Ciderabad. The grass is green and there was no toss so Somerset are batting first against Worcestershire with Matt Renshaw on the card at number three, preparing to make his debut. Dom Bess is twelfth man and Jamie Overton is not fully fit, which may not please the new chief selector. So off we go. Let’s enjoy it while we can.We are set for a start on time here for the opening day of Yorkshire’s season as Nottinghamshire visit. After seven straight washed out days against LeedsBradford MCC Universities and Essex, the wet outfield has dried thanks to the last few days of sunshine. “Someone told me it’s going to be warmer than Ibiza this week,” smiled Andrew Gale on Monday, shortly after the Championship game against Essex fell by the wayside. Thankfully the warm weather arrived, while the outfield was also subject of deep spiking aeration work on Tuesday via a Verti Drain machine (never thought I’d be looking that up when I started out on the county circuit!). The same work had been done approximately a fortnight ago as well before more wet weather came. Notts arrive here on the back of an impressive opening round victory over Lancashire at Old Trafford, inspired by seamers Jake Ball and Harry Gurney. They will be hoping to catch the Yorkies cold. Elsewhere, champions Essex are in a similar boat to Yorkshire having been kept in the starting blocks last weekend. They face Lancashire at Chelmsford …Down at Taunton, Somerset host Worcestershire, where Vic Marks is on duty, while it’s Surrey against Hampshire at the Oval. In Division Two, Northants host Warwickshire, Leicestershire face Sussex, Gloucestershire face Glamorgan, Durham host Kent and it’s Derbyshire versus Middlesex.

Kathleen Turner has for most of her 41 years in show business been Hollywood royalty. When she walks on stage and opens her mouth for this solo cabaret it is as if the MGM lion – the one whose snarl has opened a century of films – has leapt down her throat.Out comes a voice that that prowls from deep roar to deeper purr. She seems to have a cold. She appears to muff a cue. She informs us that cabaret is supposed to begin at the beginning, and launches into an anecdote about her unrequited passion for a boy in Venezuela, where her diplomat father was stationed. She sings Ella Fitzgerald’s Let’s Fall in Love. It’s heart-in-mouth stuff, and not for the right reasons – hers is not a voice equipped for young love. Is this going to be the most agonising outing of an ageing star since Norma Desmond walked down that staircase in Sunset Boulevard? The anecdotage at least feels secure. “When I first went to New York,” she tells us, “every theatrical lead was a soprano and that was never going to be me. I said, ‘No, I just act.’” Wise woman, we think. “I do tend to jump in the water and find out if I can swim,” she says, a little later. Well, yes. Then she’s into a story about performing a show about Emily Dickinson with the Martha Graham Dance Company. It involves an excruciating costume failure and Mikhail Baryshnikov confronting her in her dressing-room at half time, dressed only in a skimpy yellow towel. “He said, ‘You should dance’ and I said, ‘Sure, like you should act.’” Cue Sinatra’s Pick Yourself Up.There are lots of stories of being poor, cold and accident-prone while working her way up the career ladder. “These guys have heard this before,” she says, gesturing at her admirably reactive three-piece band, “but I had a disagreement with Francis Coppola. He said would I mind if he directed from his trailer. I said, you go direct in your trailer and I will act in mine.”It’s all quite amusing but at half-time I was wondering if I’d have stayed, had I been anything less than an uberfan. Then something miraculous happens. She finds her voice and performs Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? as if it were written not in the Great Depression but in Trump’s America. She describes what it was like to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the height of her career and somehow manages to turn Sondheim’s most lachrymose ballad, Send in the Clowns, into a growl of rage on behalf of all older women in an industry that spurns them.She owns the music. She is magnificent, this battered star with her leonine voice, which unites the personal and the political, taking possession of standards that may have been sung better but never more meaningfully. She turns the mood on a sixpence, from skittish to heartrending and back again. I only wish that Andy Gale’s staging had been more clearly framed, to make it clear from the start how much more Turner was going to offer than a sentimental dawdle down the streets where she lived. This is My Way reframed by Jessica Rabbit, who – as an opening voiceover montage reminds us – gave Turner one of her most memorable movie lines: “I’m not bad, I’m just drawn that way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/130847bfe1efb94ecb05f9c24b27e2e2b9bd495e/0_206_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8277339a33a0f41c4dd5dfb076fc7471 1240w","title":"crackdown prompt soros open society budapest viktor orban","story":"Grantmaking body acts after civil society restrictions planned by re-elected PM Viktor Orbán George Soros’s Open Society Foundations has revealed plans to close its Budapest office ahead of a crackdown on civil society by the right-wing government of the re-elected Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán.Employees were told on Thursday that the organisation, which distributes grants to local civil society groups, will close or drastically reduce operations at its office in the Hungarian capital in July and relocate to Berlin by August, the Guardian learned from multiple sources.“You might understand if I don’t cry my eyes out,” Orbán said in his regular radio interview on Friday. Since his Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority in parliament this month, Orbán has claimed a political mandate to push ahead with a new law targeting NGOs with foreign funding. The Open Society Foundation, founded by the billionaire philanthropist, said in a statement on Friday it was “closely watching developments around draft legislation that would dramatically restrict the activities of civil society in Hungary”. Its office in Budapest employs about 100 staff and oversees funding to other central and eastern European countries.Voices in Hungary’s shrinking civil sphere say the legislation is designed aims to silence organisations troublesome to Orbán, who has in recent years been increasingly hostile to Soros.The overwhelmingly anti-immigration-focused election campaign that returned the Orbán’s Fidesz government to power this month presented Soros as the personification of open border policies.Since entering Hungary in 1984, the OSF has distributed some $400m in the country - including to several senior Fidesz politicians including Orbán himself. Its donation of photocopiers to critical  samizdat publications played a role in the fall of communism.“The campaign, which has demolished George Soros for over a year, has a dual purpose: to intimidate critical voices and to fund government-friendly coverage from taxpayers’ money. We don’t yet know if this will impact us, since there is no final version of the bill, but we expect that it might affect our funding.“With the departure of the OSF, both goals have been fulfilled: the organisations supported by Soros have panicked and the government propaganda media can list ‘Soros mercenaries’.”“We are being attacked for reminding governments that power does have limitations in Europe and people can rely on civil society organisations to protect them when that power is being abused.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jacinda ardern maori cloak buckingham palace new zealand","story":"New Zealand leader in Kahu huruhuru praised as proud moment for female leaders and Māori worldwideNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has caused a stir with a striking image of her walking the halls of Buckingham Palace swathed in a traditional Māori cloak during this week’s Commonwealth heads of government meeting.The prime minister wore a Kahu huruhuru a Māori cloak adorned with feathers and bestowed on chiefs and dignitaries to convey prestige, respect and power, said Mark Sykes, guardian of Māori special collections at Te Papa, the national museum of New Zealand.On social media in New Zealand the striking image went viral, with many people commenting that the picture captured the inversion of traditional gender roles a female world leader wearing a powerful cloak while pregnant and representing her country.There are more than 10 varieties of Māori cloak, broadly referred to as Korowai, and the Kahu huruhuru become prestigious from the mid-1800s, with Kiwi feather cloaks the most valuable and sought after. Two of them were given to the Queen and Prince Philip on their 1954 tour of New Zealand, and were later worn by other members of the royal family when they visited the country.According to Te Papa, in the Māori world birds were given the task of carrying spiritual messages between the gods and people, and their feathers were prized and sacred.Ardern’s Kahu huruhuru has been loaned to her from the London Māori club Ngāti Rānana.Modern-day Kahu huruhuru are often made from the feathers of birds killed by predators or on motorways, because many native New Zealand birds such as the Kereru and Pukeko are endangered and protected species.

It was like calling next door.”Kim and Moon are expected to talk over the phone before their meeting, although no date has been set for the call.Located near the village of Panmunjom, the Joint Security Area is the only point along the roughly 250km-long demilitarised zone where North and South Korea stand opposite each other. The site was created at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War as a meeting point to discuss the uneasy truce that ended the conflict.\u0026nbspThere are six buildings that straddle the border, three of which are painted United Nations blue, where talks between the two sides occasionally take place. It is also a major tourist destination and visitors can technically cross into North Korea inside the buildings. Outside, there is a raised concrete curb that marks the border. \u0026nbspBefore two American soldiers were killed in 1976, the entire area was neutral and personnel from the North and South move freely throughout the zone. Since the murders a hard border bisecting the area has been enforced. In 2017, it was the sight of a dramatic escape by a North Korean soldier who was shot while fleeing to the South.North Korea has not commented on Moon’s claim on Thursday that Kim would not demand the withdrawal of US troops from the Korean peninsula as a precondition for abandoning his nuclear weapons during his meeting with Donald Trump in late May or early June.“North Korea is expressing a commitment to a complete denuclearisation,” Moon, a left-leaning liberal who has long favoured engagement with the North, told media executives. “They are not presenting a condition that the US cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of the American troops in South Korea ... North Korea is only talking about the end of a hostile policy against it and then a security guarantee for the country.”North Korea could offer some indication of what it expects in return for denuclearisation following a plenary session of the central committee of the ruling workers’ party that reportedly took place on Friday.The state-run KCNA news agency said the committee would discuss “policy issues of a new stage” in response to the current “important historic period of the developing Korean revolution”.Some analysts speculated the body would revise Kim’s dual “byongjin” policy of pursuing economic and nuclear development before his summits with Moon and Trump.“There is a high possibility that North Korea could unveil a new policy line, revising its byongjin policy at the plenary session,” Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, told Yonhap. “A new line will likely contain North Korea expressing its willingness to join denuclearisation talks and resolve to improve ties with the South, the US and Japan, as well as to seek peace and coexistence.”Kim’s apparent concession on US troop withdrawal has taken many by surprise. Traditionally, North Korea has justified its nuclear programme as a necessary counter to Washington’s “hostile policy” of basing tens of thousands of troops in South Korea and Japan, and guaranteeing its north-east Asian allies’ security through its nuclear umbrella.With just a week to go before Kim and Moon become the first North and South Korean leaders to meet in more than a decade, officials were trying to ensure the summit would proceed without incident or embarrassment.Earlier this week they met to discuss details, including plans to broadcast live TV coverage of the leaders’ shaking hands at the start of their talks, which will take place at the Peace House on the southern side of the border village of Panmunjom.It will be the first time a North Korean leader has visited the South since the end of the Korean war, and only the third time any South or North Korean leaders have met.The two previous inter-Korea summits, held in 2000 and 2007 in Pyongyang, involved the then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun.Moon and Kim are expected to discuss a formal end to hostilities between their countries, 65 years after the Korean war ended with an armistice, but not a peace treaty.Trump told reporters this week the Koreas “have my blessing” to secure a peace treaty and bring an end to the conflict.Six senior South Korean officials will accompany Moon to the summit, including his chief of staff, spy chief, national security adviser and unification, defence and foreign ministers, a presidential spokesman said.

Now the son of Stroessner’s private secretary is likely to become presidentFifty-eight years later, when Rogelio Goiburú dug up the body in a remote part of eastern Paraguay this March, a few teeth were all that were left to identify it.“We’re fighting against time,” he said. Paraguay’s soil is highly acidic, he explained. “It eats bones very quickly, so the DNA disappears, and it’s much harder to obtain a genetic profile.”Goiburú, 62, heads Paraguay’s commission for historical memory and reparation. Since 2011, the underfunded body has documented some 450 desaparecidos, located and exhumed 37 bodies, named four, and returned them to living relatives where possible. All were victims of the 1954-89 regime of Alfredo Stroessner, which jailed, raped, tortured and “disappeared” opponents under the auspices of a US-backed anti-communist crusade.For Goiburú, the mission is personal. His father, Agustín Goiburú, is still missing. “All human beings have the right to mourn, to know where their loved one is,” he said. “And I include myself.”But his search also carries new political resonance. On Sunday, Mario Abdo Benítez, 46 – the son of Stroessner’s private secretary – is on course to be elected president.After Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile, Paraguay is the latest country in the region to pivot rightwards. It has less far to go than some. The current president, Horacio Cartes – like Abdo Benítez a member of the Stroessner’s Colorado party – has placed former functionaries of the dictatorship in key ministries and called the general’s birthday “a happy date”.But the rise of “Marito” – championed by the church and a rural Colorado base disgruntled with Cartes’s liberal economics – is a painful reminder of how little Paraguay has reckoned with its past. Abdo Benítez has called for the enforcement of obligatory military service – another Stroessner legacy – and promised to fill all public positions with Colorado faithful.“Even though he was a kid at the time, he defends that era,” said Guillermina Kanonikoff, a former leftwing guerrilla whose husband, Mario Schaerer, was tortured to death by the regime. “He doesn’t have to carry the sin of his father,” she added. “But he never asked for forgiveness, or showed shame ... he’s creating the platform for a dictatorship.”According to Rosa Palau – custodian of the supreme court’s Museum of Justice – Paraguay’s lingering culture of fear has stopped people coming forward with information about dictatorship-era crimes.“While Stroessner left,” she added, “the authoritarianism continues.”Many older Paraguayans – particularly those with links to the military – remember the dictatorship as a time of prosperity. At a Colorado rally in Asunción two weeks before the election, Abdo Benítez defended the example of his father and the Colorado legacy. “It’s the party that has built this country,” he said.“He’s going to win by far. He’s a holy, clean, hardworking young man,” said a retiree who gave her name as María Luisa. “My husband worked for 15 years in the security services,” she added. “I’m a Stronista through and through.”Abdo Benítez will take a strongly conservative line on abortion (Paraguay forbids the termination of pregnancy in practically all cases), LGBT rights and gender equality, said Andrew Nickson, a Paraguay expert at the University of Birmingham.He added that Abdo Benítez’s father had never been personally linked to human rights abuses. “He was a crook and a sycophant but that’s about all,” Nickson said.Abdo Benítez’s advisors emphasise his commitment to Paraguay’s institutions and record as a senator of building consensus across party lines. “I think he’s demonstrated on many opportunities his democratic credentials,” said one.The dwindling number of activists who remember authoritarian rule are also counting on a new generation.“There are many young people who aren’t afraid because they didn’t live through the repression of the dictatorship,” said Goiburú. He hopes that Abdo Benítez will honour a pledge to maintain funding for the search for desaparecidos.“I always say: I’m looking for Dad, but I’m looking for everyone,” he explained. “And while my strength lasts and blood runs through my veins I’ll do it.”Excavating human remains did not scare him, he added. “You have to be afraid of those who are alive, not the dead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2334d0380e4182e09dea11c2c66d2feb01d175/0_405_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=75c90117144848ffee12d57c69cec42c 1240w","title":"syrian army bombards yarmouk refugee camp in damascus","story":"Airstrikes and shelling target rebel enclave, as chemical weapons inspectors wait to enter Douma two weeks after attackThe Syrian army has bombarded jihadis and other rebels in the last area outside government control near Damascus, as President Bashar al-Assad moved to strengthen his position around the capital after the defeat of rebels in eastern Ghouta earlier this month.The bombing came as inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) remained stranded in Damascus almost two weeks after a chemical attack on a town in Ghouta that precipitated the rebel collapse.Airstrikes and shelling hit the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp and al-Hajar al-Aswad area, part of a small enclave ided between warring jihadis and other rebels south of the capital. Live state television footage of the area showed a plume of smoke billowing across one district as guns boomed in the distance.The US, British and French missile strikes designed to punish Assad for the use of chemical weapons have done nothing to slow the advance of his forces, now in their strongest position since the early months of the seven-year war. Efforts to investigate the chemical attack in Douma on 7 April have been repeatedly delayed, leading to suspicions that the regime and its ally Russia were stalling the OPCW team into order to tamper with evidence at the site. Unprecedented protests demand civil liberties and the release of political prisoners after four decades of repressive rule by the Assad family. The regime represses demonstrations in Damascus and the southern city of Deraa but protests continue.Defecting army colonel Riad al-Asaad sets up the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army. Islamist groups join the revolt.Regime forces take control of the rebel stronghold in Homs after a month of bombardment. Other bloody operations are carried out, notably in the central city of Hama, after massive anti-regime protests.FSA fighters launch a battle for Damascus but the government holds firm.More than 1,400 people die in a chemical weapon attack on rebel-held districts near Damascus.The US and Assad ally Russia agree a plan to eliminate Syria\u0027s chemical weapons, averting punitive US strikes against the regime.Hostilities between jihadists and rebel groups turn into an open war in the north. The group that will become known as Islamic State takes Raqqa – the first provincial capital to fall out of regime control – from rebel forces.A US-led coalition launches airstrikes against Isis in Syria. The strikes benefit Kurdish groups, which since 2013 have run autonomous administrations in Kurdish-majority areas.Russia launches airstrikes in support of Assad\u0027s troops, who are on the back foot. Russian firepower helps turn the tables for the regime, which begins to retake rebel-held territory.Russia and Iran, as backers of the Syrian regime, and Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, organise talks in Kazakhstan, between representatives of both sides. The process leads to the creation of four de-escalation zones.A sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun kills more than 80 people, prompting Washington to attack a regime airbase.Further complicating an already drawn-out conflict, Turkey launches an operation against the Kurdish People\u0027s Protection Units which, with US support, played a key role in beating back Isis.Regime launches a ferocious assault on the remaining rebel-held enclave near Damascus, eastern Ghouta. In under four weeks, the Russian-backed onslaught kills more than 1,200 civilians.Russia’s official position, citing the tests done by its own military, is that the attack never took place, and that no one died as a result. Moscow has said that armed rebels forced local residents to take part in staged filming of the alleged attack’s aftermath, including by faking symptoms of chemical poisoning.However, if the inspectors find evidence of chemical weapons, officials are primed to deflect blame from Assad and try to pin the attack on rebels.Russian state media is pushing two lines: that they have spoken to witnesses who deny any attack took place, and that they have found canisters filled with chlorine in Douma, which were used for rebel attacks later blamed on the regime.On Wednesday, Russian state TV broadcast interviews with a Syrian boy it said was featured in a hospital video taken by the Syria Civil Defence, a volunteer organisation known as the White Helmets.The boy, whose name is Hassan Diab, said he was in a bomb shelter with his mother and felt fine, when people on the street told everyone to go to the hospital. There, they were filmed being doused in water and given other simulated medical treatment. A state television reporter, citing Diab’s father, said the boy was given rice and figs for his part in the video.The boy’s father, who was not present at the time of the attack, said he later found his son at the hospital. He said that no chemical attack took place in Douma that night.That contradicts accounts by victims given to a number of western outlets, which put the death toll from the attack at more than 40 people, many trapped in the basement of a three-storey house. CBS News, reporting from Douma, published a photograph of the missile said by locals to have carried the chemical payload lodged in the building’s facade.Doctors responsible for treating patients in the hours after the 7 April attack said they faced government intimidation to stay quiet. The World Health Organisation said that 500 people sought medical treatment with “signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals”.“It’s absolute misinformation and a cover-up,” said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an adviser to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, of the Russian denials. “But I know that a number of samples have gotten out of Syria and have been tested, and I’m hoping they will confirm what happened.”In another Russian state TV programme broadcast one day before Diab’s interview, Russian soldiers on the ground in Douma said they found underground rebel labs for producing chemical weapons, including chlorine. A Russian official showed state journalists chemical equipment and materials, which are needed to produce sulfur and nitrogen mustard gas.Key among the findings was a chemical cylinder, which a Russian official said was filled with chlorine gas, and which was nearly identical to the ones used in the 7 April video that Russia accused of being fake.“Thanks to these instructions, using this equipment, the fighters made the gas they later used in their provocations,” a state TV journalist reported. Later in the report, he referred to the cylinder: “The rebels pumped chlorine into similar vessels, took it to the city, and then presented it all as an attack by the Syrian army.”Russia said that the Khan Shaykhun nerve gas attack, which killed at least 87 people in 2017, occurred because a government airstrike had hit a rebel depot for chemical munitions. The Assad government denied at first that any incident had taken place.In October 2017, the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism found that Assad’s forces launched the attack.One month later, Russia vetoed the renewal of the inquiry, calling it biased. The inquiry had identified multiple instances when the Syrian government stood behind chemical gas attacks in the country, as well as attacks carried out by Isis.With the OPCW fact-finding mission only capable of confirming the use of chemical weapons and not assigning blame, de Bretton-Gordon said Russia’s response was predictable.“The US, the British and the French will have a UN resolution to sanction the Syrians and no doubt the Russians will veto it,” he said. “We’ll be back in our cycle.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3467680.1524170889!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"call for saturday leaving cert exams to ease appalling pressure on students","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAbout 70 students iin this year’s Leaving Cert exams face sitting three exams in a single day due to subject clashes and timetable congestion.School principals have called for Leaving Cert exams to be held on Saturdays to help ease “appalling” pressure on students.About 70 students in total in this year’s exams face sitting three exams in a single day, over the course of about nine hours, due to subject clashes and timetable congestion.However, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals says the number of students affected is set to rise as more subjects are added to the Leaving Cert curriculum.At present, some 35 subjects on the curriculum are examined over two and a half week period in June.These numbers are set to increase when computer science and PE are added to the senior cycle curriculum. In addition, there are plans to include more foreign languages - such as Chinese - on the curriculum.The State Examinations Commission says it will explore alternative solutions with education partners to address the issue of timetable congestion. Clive Byrne, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said one solution was to hold some exams on Saturdays, or else make exams generally shorter.Extending exams into the final week of June posed problems for schools and could make it more difficult to hire supervisors, he said. In addition, it would shorten the window of time available to correct Leaving Cert exams.“Three exams in one day is appalling. It amounts to enormous stress on students. If exams are to remain in the traditional two-and-half week timeframe, we should look at holding them on Saturdays,” Mr Byrne said.“Alternatively. shorter exams should be examined. If a student has to sit three exams, they could be three one-and-a-half hour exams. “We now have exams in English and history which last three hours and 20 minutes. This done’t even happed at second-level.”The introduction of politics - a new subject on the curriculum - to the Leaving Cert this year has put exam congestion in the spotlight.A total of 16 Leaving Cert students have to sit their politics exam in a special evening sitting due to subject clashes.Some of these students –11 in total – will end up sitting three exams in a single day. This means they will sit their first exam at 9.30am and will not finish until 8pm.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468540.1524237442!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"earth day in ireland list of the main events this weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A display of plastic at Nolan’s supermarket in Clontarf, north Dublin,  explaining  how the supermarket plans to  tackle the problem of excessive plastics.   Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Irish TimesA “shop and drop” day of action on plastic packaging at supermarkets on Saturday and community cleanups of waterways, beaches and public areas over the weekend are being organised to mark Earth Day on Sunday.Pleasant spring weather forecast for Saturday is expected to help those organising clean-ups by community groups and volunteers who will be targeting polluting plastics and litter and cleanups of rivers and canals.Earth Day has been staged every year since 1970 “to demonstrate support for environmental protection” throughout the world.Irish Environmental Network co-ordinator Michael Ewing welcomed the decision by Earth Day organisers to push for an end to plastic pollution.“Infinite growth of the plastics industry and over-consumption of single use plastic is unsustainable,” he said.“The world had reached a tipping point in terms of our planet’s capacity to deal with “the deluge of plastic waste.“There can be no going back to the business-as-usual now. Earth Day is a great opportunity for citizens across the world to show their desire to rid the world of single-use plastics from our day to day lives.”The biggest single event in Ireland this weekend is Saturday’s “shop and drop” day of action on plastic packaging which will be held at hundreds of supermarkets across Ireland, which is being organised by environmental groups.Friends of the Earth director Oisín Coghlan said: “The Earth is our only home. And it’s a miracle of nature, a goldilocks’s planet’: not too hot, not too cold just right for human life.“But its ability to feed us and keep us safe is now at risk. Our pollution is destabilising the climate and depleting the soils and the seas.”“The huge public response to the issue of plastic pollution shows that people do get it and want to protect the environment,” he said.A new initiative called Dublin Waters Action Day will see a huge voluntary effort targeted at cleaning up Dublin’s rivers and canals on Saturday morning.Dodder Action and the Dublin Canals Group have joined together with Treasure the Tolka Swords Tidy Towns and Friends of the Camac to clean Dublin’s rivers and canals.Dodder Action volunteers will clean at 10 points from Old Bawn in Tallaght to the Irishtown Basin, through Firhouse, Rathfarnham, Milltown, Clonskeagh and Donnybrook. For more information see: www.dodderaction.orgDublin Canals will clean at nine points from Grand Canal Basin through Lesson Street Bridge to Crossguns Bridge to North Strand back to Spencer Dock. For more information see: dublincanalsactionday.ieMeanwhile smaller, community groups will clean the Tolka, Camac and Ward rivers.All these groups will welcome volunteers (at 10am for the Dodder and 10.45am for the canals).Equipment and gloves will be provided. “All we need is people, even if they just want to come along for an hour,” said Dodder Action chair Victoria White.The initiative is part of An Taisce’s National Spring Clean programme, and will be focussing on the proliferation of plastic.She also called for the introduction of a deposit scheme for bottles and cans which she said account for 95 per cent of litter.“We hope Dublin Waters Action Day will sharpen the focus of residents and politicians alike on the importance of keeping our waterways clear of pollution.”Call of CurlewAs part of Earth Day the Irish Peatland Conservation Council (IPCC) is marking the first World Curlew Day at the Bog of Allen Nature Centre in Rathangan, Co Kildare at 2pm on Saturday.It is giving a talk on the endangered curlew and hosting a guided walk to Lodge Bog – See: bogs@ipcc.ieIPCC conservation officer Katie Geraghty said staff and volunteers at the centre looked forward to the return of the Curlew to Lodge Bog each year.“We are privileged to have them in our locality and it is important that we all work together to help them breed successfully.”The Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun, Dublin is offering free information tours (at 11am and 3pm on Saturday). Located in the recently re-purposed Ballymun Boiler House, it “challenges conventional thinking about how we live, stimulates positive environmental behavioural change and highlights how we can use our resources wisely to achieve a low carbon, sustainable society”. It is also the national centre for the circular economy.Jim Lawlor from the Native Woodland Trust will give a talk on native woodlands - a “1,000 year project” - at the Cool Planet experience in Powerscourt estate, Enniskerry, Co Wicklow, on Sunday afternoon.For more details see: https:cpe.coolpagesearth-optimism-dayMicroplastics:Also coinciding with Earth Day, a project raising awareness of the impact of microplastics on the Irish coastline was announced on Friday.“IMPACT: The Microplastics Awareness Project” is led by scientists from Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) – it will host interactive science workshops “on the beach and in the classroom” over coming months to encourage young people to tackle the threat of microplastics and plastic waste in their local communities.Artists have created enormous works of art across Europe to protest against plastic pollution in the run-up to Earth Day. Sand etchings up to 30 metres in diameter depicting sea creatures battling with plastic waste have appeared on beaches in France, Spain, Portugal, the UK and Germany during April.A final piece is set to be created on the Dutch coast on Saturday by the artist Tim Hoekstra, who has campaigned against plastic pollution since 2013.“Every time I come to the beach, I see washed up plastic, mostly food and drink packaging. It has got much worse in recent years. It makes me sick to think that our kids might never know what a clean beach or water is really like,” Mr Hoekstra said.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?The Crossword Club provides access to an archive of more than 6,000 interactive crosswords from The Irish Times.

Photograph: Eric Luke Former taoiseach Brian Cowen has described Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis as a hardline right-winger who has never shown any interest in Ireland. In a rare interview, the ex-Fianna Fáil leader said the much-ridiculed remarks by Mr Davis last week that Sinn Féin was driving a hardened Irish Government stance on the border revealed how little the Tories understand the country. “That’s just another indication of where the right-wing Tory party is in relation to their knowledge of how Ireland works,” Mr Cowen told RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke. “He’s not a person who has shown much interest in Ireland in the past in my experience, and I was involved for a very long time. Speaking in London, Mr Davis said he had not anticipated Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s tough approach in the Brexit negotiations, which he suggested was swayed by “quite a strong influence from Sinn Féin”.Challenged about the assertion, he replied: “Well you had a change of leader or a change in taoiseach. They’ve been playing a strong political role which they haven’t done historically, that I hadn’t foreseen.”A similar claim has been made by a number of other Conservative politicians in recent months, including former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Patterson. Mr Varadkar called the comments “strange” and “inaccurate”, while Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said they were “nonsense”.Referring to Britain’s stated objective of leaving the EU customs union while maintaining a soft border, Mr Cowen said it “defies logic”. “We will have to await the ingenuity of the Brits to see if they can come up with an answer,” he said.Striking a sceptical note, he added: “The whole Brexit agenda is being pushed by the right wing of the Tory party for some years now and I’ve never had much faith in their genuine interest in what impacts on Ireland as far as they are concerned.”Mr Cowen said he had remained “silent on this issue” for a long time because he wanted to hear the British position. “Initial reactions from Europe regarding their thoughts on the issue are not very reassuring,” he said. Mr Cowen also took issue with recent claims by former Northern Ireland First Minister and ex-Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble that Dublin’s negotiating stance could provoke loyalist paramilitaries. “Obviously one would listen to what Mr Trimble has to say, given role in the past, but I honestly believe that can’t come into the consideration of these negotiations or how Ireland views them,” he said. “The fact is we have national interests to protect, we are just as determined to protect them as the British are to protect theirs.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468571.1524238079!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unions crank up pressure on public service pay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers are among those public servants demanding a pay disparity be dealt immediately. Pictured at the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation annual conference earlier this month are Graham Fitzpatrick, Ed Platt, John Paul Phelan and Michael Weed, who are calling for equal pay for all teachers. Photograph: Moya Nolan.A year ago the Government believed the issue of public service pay was settled until the end of 2020.An €850 million deal was to provide State employees with increases of between 6.2 and 7.4 per cent over three years.Now the Government is facing renewed pay pressures on multiple fronts.Trade unions want pay improvements for staff recruited after 2011, who currently are paid less than colleagues who are longer in service, brought forward to next year.The Government wanted to hold off on tackling this issue until the beginning of 2021.Talks between the Government and trade unions on this controversial two-tier pay system are to commence next Friday.In addition, within the next few weeks the Public Service Pay Commission is expected to produce a report examining whether there are recruitment and retentions difficulties in different parts of the public service.The first report will deal with the health service with doctors and nurses arguing strongly that better pay available overseas is encouraging staff to take up posts abroad, leaving significant vacancies in hospitals across the country.Medical organisations, for example, claim 400 full-time consultant positions are unfilled.Trade unions will want any acknowledgement by the Public Service Pay Commission that recruitment and retention pressures exist to lead to immediate talks on pay rises.The Public Service Pay Commission is also due to report on recruitment and retention difficulties in the defence forces later in the year.The Irish Times reported earlier this month that the Department of Defence is to recommend that a loyalty bonus - which was previously set at up to €22,000 - should be re-introduced to address a shortage of military pilots.This would be the first public indication that the Government acknowledges additional pay is needed to encourage the retention of key personnel in some parts of the public service.It called for Civil Service managers to be given greater pay flexibility in their attempts to recruit in areas where staff are scarce.Trade unions also want allowances for staff which were cut following the economic crash to be increased in line with pay rises under the current deal rather than in October 2020 as currently proposed.The Government is also facing into talks with general practitioners on a new contract in which they will want a reversal of significant cuts which they experienced over recent years.GPs are not public service staff.However, they provide key public services under contract which are critical to the success of the Government’s overall healthcare reforms.There are also likely to be strong calls by public service staff for the abolition of the additional, unpaid working hours, introduced after the economic crash. The Government estimates this change alone could cost over €600 million.The most immediate challenge for the Government, both politically and from the trade unions, will be in relation to pay for those recruited since January 2011.There has been a vociferous campaign in recent times - led largely by teachers - to have this two-tier pay system addressed.However, this is by no means a matter that only affects the education sector.Trade unions will demand the same when the talks start next Friday.A recent report by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform maintained that nearly 60,000 staff across the public service - or nearly 20 per cent of the total - now work on lower pay arrangements than their colleagues recruited prior to January 2011.However, if all the demands descending on the Government to deal with recruitment and retention, the provision of new services, a reversal of cuts to allowances etc are to be addressed, the cost to the public service pay bill would be far, far higher.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3467710.1524178720!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu rejects theresa may s irish border proposals says report","story":"EU Commission president Donald Tusk says that\u0027s Britain\u0027s decision to leave the EU has caused the border issue in Ireland, and it is up the UK to help solve the problem.

It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work,” a source told the paper.Last month, Ms May said remaining in the EU customs union would “not be compatible with meaningful independent trade policy” and proposed two options for avoiding a hard border while retaining the ability to set tariffs.Ms May has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, instead proposing two alternative models.The first, a “customs partnership” would see Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the country en route to Europe and applying its own tariffs to imported goods destined for the British market.The Telegraph reports that this was rejected by the EU on three grounds – that the EU could not allow a country outside its supervision mechanisms and IT systems to levy duties and that it unfairly placed the burden of collecting tariffs on business.It was also rejected as implementing the scheme on the EU side of the channel would be too expensive.The second, a “customs arrangement”, envisages technological and administrative measures ensuring that trade with the EU remains frictionless, with additional measures for Northern Ireland such as allowing small traders to operate across the Border unchecked.This too was rejected by EU states who are said concerned about setting precedents for ‘turning a blind eye’ with countries like Turkey, while it was pointed out that other ideas like having authorised economic operators fell short of what was needed to avoid a border.At a briefing in Brussels last week, one ambassador put up his hand and asked if anyone could tell him how to open an export-import business in Ireland, “because it is going to be a great business if there are no customs controls”, according to an account obtained by the Telegraph.A powerful cross-party group of MPs are set to force a vote in the House of Commons next week calling on Ms May’s government to seek to remain in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland.The motion, which has been tabled by 10 select committee chairmen including Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, will be debated next Thursday.A vote on the motion will be non-binding but the debate will increase pressure on the British government to keep the customs union option alive following a massive defeat on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The motion notes the importance of frictionless trade with the EU for British manufacturing and “further notes that the free circulation of goods on the island of Ireland is a consequence of the UK and Republic of Ireland’s membership of the EU customs union”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468574.1524238727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit britain remains committed to no hard border in north","story":"EU Commission president Donald Tusk says that\u0027s Britain\u0027s decision to leave the EU has caused the border issue in Ireland, and it is up the UK to help solve the problem. Video: EU Parliament\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA newspaper report has claimed British prime minister Theresa May has been told her plans for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland will not work. Photograph: AFPDowning Street has expressed confidence Britain can reach a deal with the European Union to avoid a hard border in Ireland, despite reports that all its proposals have been rejected by Brussels. “We are confident that in the coming months if all sides work together productively we can achieve a solution,” British prime minister Theresa May’s official spokesman said.“We have been clear that the UK is leaving the customs union and we need to find a solution that protects things like the Belfast Agreement, avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and protects Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. That continues to be our focus.”According to news reports, EU negotiators have rejected as unworkable both of Britain’s proposals to keep trade frictionless after Brexit, a “customs partnership” and a “streamlined customs arrangement”. A customs partnership would see Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the country en route to Europe and applying its own tariffs to imported goods destined for the British market.The second, a customs arrangement, envisages technological and administrative measures ensuring that trade with the EU remains frictionless, with additional measures for Northern Ireland such as allowing small traders to operate across the Border unchecked.The EU is reported to have rejected the customs union because it does not want a country outside its supervision to levy duties, that it placed the burden of collecting tariffs on business, and that implementing the scheme on the EU side would be too costly. Its objection to the customs arrangement proposal apparently reflects a reluctance to turn a blind eye to possible irregularities along the Border.Britain last month rejected the EU’s language on the Border in a draft withdrawal agreement because it claims it only partially reflects the joint report agreed between the two sides last December.The joint report outlined the terms of a “backstop” arrangement if other measures fail to prevent a hard border, including regulatory alignment between North and South.A subsequent paragraph, promising no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, is not included in the EU’s draft withdrawal agreement.The House of Commons will vote next week on a motion calling on the British government to seek to remain in a customs union with the European Union in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The motion, which has been tabled by 10 select committee chairs including Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, will be non-binding but the debate will increase pressure on the government to keep the customs union option alive following a massive defeat on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

But not when I\u0027m sitting upstairs.\u0026quot De Silva and his accomplice, who is still on the run, targeted these two Mercedes A200s parked on the street in ChelseaBefore targeting the investment banker de Silva and an accomplice, who is still at large, stole more than £1,000 worth of goods in Chelsea and Fulham earlier that night.On Ellerby Street, Fulham, de Silva robbed lawyer Stephen Wisking and stole a Dell Laptop, an Apple iPad Pro, €100 in cash, a blue canvas bag containing paperwork and another black bag from his BMW X5.He went on to Roskell Road, Putney, and stole Bose headphones and a red bag containing books and documents belonging to William Bond.In a third robbery at Beaufort Street in Chelsea de Silva stole a black holdall and ID documents from Ashley Fromberg.Mr Canny\u0027s girlfriend, who asked not to be named, said: \u0026quotWe were sitting on the sofa when we heard the first window smash and looked out the window and then my boyfriend, who was just in his pants, ran down and tackled him to the ground.\u0026quotHe was trying to get away and he just pinned him down, my boyfriend used to play rugby so this guy didn\u0027t have much of a chance.\u0026quotThere were two of them, one on a moped as a getaway vehicle and the other guy. They were smashing into cars and did in about six others that night too.\u0026quotI did a bit of shouting myself, but he was the one who was wrestling this man to the ground.\u0026quotThe moped driver tried to punch him a couple of times but it didn\u0027t seem to be making much of a difference so he drove off and left his mate behind.\u0026quotThere were about 20 people watching in the end.\u0026quotBefore he was taken down, de Silva and his accomplice managed to smash the back windows of the cars, which alerted the former rugby playerThe two Mercedes belonging to Mr Canny and his girlfriend were the thieves\u0027 fourth target.He pinned de Silva to the ground opposite Gordon Ramsay\u0027s Maze Grill restaurant in Chelsea in front of passersby at around 9.30pm on March 7.During the brawl de Silva\u0027s accomplice, who is still on the run from police, began to punch brave Mr Canny but gave up and fled on a getaway moped.De Silva, of no fixed abode, was left battered with two black eyes and was sent to a young offenders institution for 18 months at Isleworth Crown Court after pleading guilty to a string of offences.The teenager\u0027s offending also saw him breach a six month sentence suspended for 24 months he received in February last year for dangerous driving when he hit a pavement on the wrong side of the road.He pleaded guilty to eight charges - three counts of theft from a motor vehicle, two counts of criminal damage, handling stolen goods, a single count of assault with intent to resist arrest and breaching a previous suspended sentence.Law and orderBling 12-year-oild Indian heir gives up luxury to become a monkWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Aspiring model has tried to take her own life after random acid attackBoris Johnson says Britain will support Zimbabwe to return to Commonwealth if elections are fairDog feared to have cancer had actually eaten four teddy bears... but vet didn\u0026#39t realise until midway through operation North and South Korea make first call on hotline set up ahead of summit with Kim Jong-unInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The fascinating venue where Prince Harry will marry Meghan MarkleOxford University tips off police in attempt to end the \u0026#39inconsiderate and entitled\u0026#39 tradition of \u0026#39trashing\u0026#39Daughter of Holby City actor \u0026#39first to die\u0026#39 from taking new party drug 2CP, court hearsLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchExclusive: EU rejects Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit Irish border solution as doubts grow over whether UK can leave customs unionNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

It was like calling next door,” he said.The hotline is intended to prevent misunderstandings between the neighbouring countries, who are still technically at war.However, it will be used more immediately over the next few days when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in speak for the first time shortly before they meet face to face at a summit on in the demilitarised border zone (DMZ) between their two countries.The meeting will only be the third summit of its kind since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War and the first since 2007, when Mr Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il met with then South Korean leader, Roh Moo-hyun.The talks next Friday, in the Peace House on the southern side of the DMZ could prove to be a significant signpost for unprecedented negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearisation between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump which are anticipated in late May or early June.The thorny issue of denuclearisation are set to be high on the agenda of next week’s meeting, although the nuts and bolts of what that means will ultimately be thrashed out between Pyongyang and Washington.President Moon on Thursday sounded an early note of optimism about the prospects for progress, indicating that Mr Kim had dropped his demand that US troops leave the Korean Peninsula in return for giving up his nuclear weapons, potentially removing one of the biggest obstacles to a peace deal.The US has about 28,000 troops stationed in South Korea, which Pyongyang has long used as a justification for building its nuclear programme as a deterrent.That view may now be shifting, said Mr Moon. “The North Koreans did not present any conditions that the United States could not accept, such as the withdrawal of American troops in South Korea,” he told the press in Seoul.“They only talk about an end to hostilities against their country and about getting security guarantees,” he said. “It’s safe to say that the plans for dialogue between the North and the United States could proceed because that has been made clear.”However, North Korea watchers have warned that diplomatic progress with Pyongyang is likely to be long and laboured, and can only truly be assessed once leaders sit around the table.Bill Hagerty, the US ambassador to Japan, said Mr Trump would use his own summit to demand also the elimination of the North’s stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons.He said the issue came up in broader discussions on the North’s weapons capabilities between Mr Trump and Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida earlier this week. “We had broad-ranging discussions on the topic and it extended beyond denuclearisation to the topics of chemical and biological weapons as well”, Mr Hagerty said. The North is believed to have large reserves of weaponised chemical and biological agents - including hydrogen cyanide, phosgene, sarin, tabun, chlorine and a number of derivatives of mustard gas - and a number of defectors have claimed the regime has used its own citizens as guinea pigs in weapons tests.The regime has also been accused by the UN of supplying materials for chemical weapons to Syria.Another sensitive issue to be negotiated will be the potential signing of a peace treaty between the North and South.Impoverished North Korea and the wealthier, democratic South are in theory still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Pyongyang has for many years been engaged in a standoff over its nuclear and missiles programmes, with tensions last year peaking to the point where military conflict with the US appeared to be a credible possibility.Inside Panmunjom the DMZ truce village - KoreaBut tensions have eased in recent months following the introduction of severe United Nations-backed sanctions that have squeezed the North Korean economy.The most recent hotline will complement a border hotline between the two countries which reopened in January after a two year hiatus caused by rising animosity over the North’s nuclear ambitions.Its reopening followed immediately after a New Year’s speech by Kim Jong-un that proposed negotiations with the South on the easing of tensions and floated the possibility of the North sending a delegation to the February Winter Olympics.Please review our commenting policyBling 12-year-oild Indian heir gives up luxury to become a monkWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Aspiring model has tried to take her own life after random acid attackBoris Johnson says Britain will support Zimbabwe to return to Commonwealth if elections are fairDog feared to have cancer had actually eaten four teddy bears... but vet didn\u0026#39t realise until midway through operation Inside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The fascinating venue where Prince Harry will marry Meghan MarkleOxford University tips off police in attempt to end the \u0026#39inconsiderate and entitled\u0026#39 tradition of \u0026#39trashing\u0026#39Daughter of Holby City actor \u0026#39first to die\u0026#39 from taking new party drug 2CP, court hearsLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchExclusive: EU rejects Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit Irish border solution as doubts grow over whether UK can leave customs unionNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

confirmed successor queen next head commonwealth","story":"Prince Charles is confirmed as the successor to Queen Elizabeth II as next Head of the CommonwealthThe Prince of Wales will one day succeed the Queen to become the next Head of Commonwealth, a meeting of leaders has decided today.Commonwealth presidents and prime ministers have agreed that the Prince will follow the Queen to lead the \u0026quotfamily of nations\u0026quot, according to sources.The decision is expected to be officially announced later today, with sources confirming a consensus has already been reached during a private retreat of the 53 Commonwealth heads of government at Windsor Castle.There, presidents and prime ministers from across the world convened to finalise plans and hopes for the future of the Commonwealth,  each decided by consensus.The thorny issue of who will succeed the Queen has dominated this week’s agenda at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), with the Prince of Wales considered by many the only realistic contender to take over the honorary, non-hereditary position.Confirmation of the Prince\u0027s future role followed a concerted effort on the part of the Royal Family this week, beginning with Prince Harry and culminating in a speech from the Queen herself.  On Monday, Prince Harry had embarked on work as the newly-appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador to emphasise the family’s ties with the Commonwealth, paying tribute to his grandmother\u0027s long service and his father\u0027s foresight on issues such as climate change.  \u0026quotIn my new role, I will work to support the Queen, my father the Prince of Wales, and my brother William, all of whom know that young people are the answer to the challenges of today,\u0026quot he told a conference hall full of young people.  His brother, the Duke of Cambridge, swiftly followed, welcoming CHOGM delegates by warning them they would be “seeing a lot of the Royal Family” during the week with a twinkle in his eye.  \u0026quotFor us in the Royal Family, supporting The Queen who has dedicated her life loyally and without fail to the Commonwealth is an enormous honour,” he said.  On Tuesday, the Prince of Wales began his own work at the CHOGM forums, regaling attendees with his fond memories of his visits to each of their countries, and spending time with Prime Minister Narendra Modi admiring an exhibition about India at the Science Museum.  The Queen and the Prince of Wales at the official opening of CHOGMWhile the combined efforts of the princes were no doubt appreciated, the Queen left nothing to chance.  On Thursday, as she spoke at the official opening of CHOGM at Buckingham Palace, she made a heartfelt address spelling out for the first time her hopes for the future of the Commonwealth, and offering her full support to her son.  “It remains a great pleasure and honour to serve you as Head of the Commonwealth and to observe, with pride and satisfaction, that this is a flourishing network,” she told the assembled heads.Leaders meet at Windsor for the CHOGM retreat \u0026quotIt is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day The Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949.”  While it was understood that the Prince’s position as future Head of Commonwealth has been quietly decided for some time, the Queen’s public words had a galvanising effect on world leaders.  In the same ceremony, Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of Malta, said of the Prince: \u0026quotWe are certain that, when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0026quot  Heads of government join the Commonwealth\u0026#39s Secretary General Baroness Scotland (right) for the Windsor Castle retreatLater that day, Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian Prime Minister, confirmed his country “strongly supports the continuation of the king or queen of the United Kingdom as the head of the Commonwealth.”  \u0026quotPrince Charles in time will succeed his mother,” he added.   \u0026quotThe head of the Commonwealth, which is a ceremonial role, a role of honour rather than one of political authority, that role I think should continue, and this is the very widespread view, with the Queen\u0027s successor.\u0026quot  Speaking to press, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, said: \u0026quotI very much agree with the wishes of Her Majesty that the Prince of Wales be the next head of the Commonwealth.\u0026quot  The Prince of Wales, Queen, Baroness Scotland and Theresa May at a Buckingham Palace dinner to celebrate the CommonwealthAnd Ralph Regenvanu, the foreign minister of the Pacific state of Vanuatu, disclosed: \u0026quotWe see it almost naturally that it should be the British royal family because it is the Commonwealth after all\u0026quot.  On Friday, the decision was made behind closed doors, and is expected to shortly be announced publicly along with the leaders\u0027 decisions on Commonwealth policy on everything from the environment to trade.The Prince is now likely to attend future CHOGMs without his mother, representing the Queen overseas as she scales down her travel in her 90s.Prince Harry is to be the Commonwealth Youth AmbassadorHe has previously attended the meeting four times, in Edinburgh in 1997, Uganda in 2007, Sri Lanka in 2013 and Malta in 2015 when he appeared with the Queen.  He will also continue tours to Commonwealth countries with the Duchess of Cornwall, having already visited 44 of them in his travels since 1969.In the last year, he has travelled to Australia, Vanuatu, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and India.Commonwealth Heads

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy.

Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.The Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripThe population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.As well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.This is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Understanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Polls suggest Labour may win a bigger share of the vote in the capital than any party ever has, and could take control of the flagship Conservative boroughs of Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster.Commenting on the latest figures, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, attacked Conservative councils over their “abject failure” on house-building and accused them of “refusing to play their

incredible figures clearly show that Labour councils are building almost twice as much affordable housing as Conservative councils across London.“In doing so, they lay bare the massive difference in political priorities between a Labour Party that is committed to building the genuinely affordable homes Londoners need and a Conservative Party that isn’t.“Not only do these figures reveal that Conservative councils are refusing to play their part in tackling London’s housing crisis, they paint a truly damning picture of the Tory record on affordable housing in London – a record that is not only shameful, but utterly indefensible.He added: “I’m angry that Londoners living in Conservative-run boroughs have been so badly let down by Tory councils that are failing to build the genuinely affordable homes they need. If these boroughs had been run by Labour over the last four years, up to 6,000 more genuinely affordable homes could have been started for Londoners.” The Conservatives have been contacted for comment.The average Conservative borough has begun work on 720 genuinely affordable homes since 2014, when local elections were last held in London, while Labour councils started an average of 1,310.Labour claimed a further 6,000 affordable homes could have been built if it controlled the 10 boroughs that are currently run by the Tories.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “These figures show what Labour in power can deliver for Londoners. Sadiq is building record numbers of homes that people can actually afford to live in - including new social homes, homes at the new London living rent set at a third of local income, and affordable shared ownership.“I am pledging that a Labour government would do the same for people across the country. Under the Tories housing has become about speculation for a wealthy few, pricing out millions of people from a decent, secure home.”Of the 38,514 genuinely affordable homes started in London since 2014, 26,202 were built under Labour councils – although this is only 2,200 homes more than would be expected given Labour controls almost two-thirds of London councils.While the average Labour-run authority began 1,310 affordable homes per year, many Tory-led boroughs managed less than half this. In four years, Hillingdon built 558, Bromley 548, Westminster 423 and Richmond Upon Thames 308.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . Outgoing Cuban President Raul Castro  raising the arm of Cuba\u0027s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel after he was formally named by the National Assembly, in Havana.

turned aroundAlmost a third of the 3,863 reefs that make up Australia\u0026rsquos UNESCO listed World Heritage Site suffered huge levels of coral loss in the recent calamitous heatwave.\u0026nbspSuch was the damage to the world\u0026rsquos largest reef system that the brilliantly-coloured and vibrant living marvels found their ability fully sustain ecological functioning transformed.\u0026nbspUsing satellites, scientists have been able to map the pattern of heat exposure along the 1,400-mile length of the reef and measure coral survival after the extreme marine heatwave of 2016.\u0026nbspLevels of coral death were linked to the amount of \u0026ldquobleaching\u0026rdquo and heat exposure, with the northern third of the Reef most severely affected.\u0026nbsp                Disturbing Great Barrier Reef discovery as Prince Charles holds summit                Coral reefs: UK pledges to protect world\u0026rsquos colourful marine wondersNCCoral bleaching occurs due to environmental stressThe new study \u0026ndash published this week in Nature \u0026ndash shows how 29 per cent of the thousands of reefs lost two-thirds or more of their corals.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe coral die-off has caused radical changes in the mix of coral species on hundreds of inidual reefs, where mature and erse reef communities are being transformed into more degraded systems, with just a few tough species remaining,\u0026rdquo explained Professor Andrew Baird, from the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (Coral CoE) at James Cook University, co-author of the new report.\u0026nbspCoral bleaching, put simply, happens when environmental stress impacts on the \u0026ldquosymbiotic\u0026rdquo relationship between the rock-like living creatures that form the reefs and microscopic algae that give them their incredible colours.\u0026nbspWhen stressful factors, particularly the warming up of ocean waters because of climate change, take effect, the corals expel the algae, leaving them to become transparent skeletons.\u0026nbspWithout the algae, the coral then starves.\u0026nbspFollowing on the 2016 heatwave impacts, the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe heat stress and bleaching last year.\u0026nbspAuthors of the new study warn full recovery to pre-bleaching coral assemblages is unlikely to occur because coral colonies are continuing to die slowly and it takes at least a decade for even fast-growing species to replace them.\u0026nbspYet Prof Terry Hughes, Director of the Coral CoE at James Cook University, has a sanguine approach to the successive losses. \u0026ldquoThat still leaves a billion or so corals alive, and on average, they are tougher than the ones that died,\u0026rdquo he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe need to focus urgently on protecting the glass that\u0026rsquos still half full, by helping these survivors to recover.\u0026nbspNCThe coral is NOT doomed if greenhouse emissions are quickly curbed \u0026ldquoThe Great Barrier Reef is certainly threatened by climate change, but it is not doomed if we deal very quickly with greenhouse gas emissions.\u0026nbspOur study shows that coral reefs are already shifting radically in response to unprecedented heatwaves.\u0026rdquoFindings from the study, say scientists, highlights the need for assessing the risk of a widespread collapse of coral reef ecosystems, particularly if action on climate change fails to limit warming to below 1.5-2C pre-industrial averages.\u0026nbspFailure will radically alter reefs and undermine the benefits the provide to millions of people around the world, say the scientists.\u0026nbsp

Each national flag is heavy with history, which can be problematic.It is interesting to see from our findings that Britons would feel more comfortable representing their nation during a sporting event than, say, a patron saint\u0027s holiday, as perhaps the context of sporting rivalries and team support smooths over the harder edges of patriotism.----------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Emmanuel-Macron-Theresa-May-and-Donald-Tusk-and-Jean-Claude-Juncker-948820.jpg","title":"EU upset over Britain France bond Anglo Franco relations","story":"The Anglo-Franco relationship appears to be stronger than ever after both Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron emphasised their commitment to tackle international security issues together at a Sandhurst summit in January.Since their face-to-face meeting in January, Mrs May has called on Mr Macron to back her in a series of strikes - including one on Syria\u0026rsquos chemical weapons stockpiles - and the expulsion of Russian spies from the UK following the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.A UK Government source told Politico: \u0026ldquoOne of the things Macron has always been very keen on since they had their first meeting was to focus the relationship on security and defence.\u0026ldquoSalisbury and Syria have given more substance to that \u0026mdash he has made it play out in practice.\u0026rdquoGettyThe UK and France have upset the European Union by forging a new alliance                 Syria attack: British, US and French forces rain down terror on Syria                Calls for French to replace English after Brexit MOCKED by French CEOBritish Government officials believe that the partnership with France is good amidst Brexit negotiations, as it shows that the two nations will continue to share security and military details after March 2019.However, some in the EU, are not pleased at the friendship, as they want to \u0026ldquopunish\u0026rdquo Britain for leaving and think it\u0026rsquos only right the UK is left out in the cold after leaving the EU.Last year, Brexit Secretary David Davis urged the European Union not to punish the UK over the orce.He told The Andrew Marr show: \u0026ldquoWe cannot have a circumstance when the other side says they are going to punish you, so if that happens then there\u0027s a walk away and we have to plan for that.\u0026rdquoGettyThe Anglo-Franco relationship appears to be stronger than ever with Mrs May and Mr MacronMrs May, however, recently made the decision to join France and the US in launching airstrikes against Syria after Bashar al-Assad\u0027s Government was alleged to have carried out a chemical weapon attack which killed 70 people.She faced a chorus of disapproval from opposition MPs for not seeking parliamentary approval or a United Nations (UN) resolution for the air strikes.But she defended her decision not to recall Parliament, suggesting the \u0026ldquosecurity\u0026rdquo of the operation could have been compromised.She said: \u0026ldquoThe speed with which we acted was essential in co-operating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations.\u0026rdquoGettyMrs May might topple the budding romance between the French man and Donald TrumpHowever, while she did not inform her own MPs, she did manage to talk with Mr Macron twice ahead of the planned action.

They are also capable of shutting down power stations and have wreaked havoc in the Mediterranean sea.However, Stefano Piraino, a zoology professor at the University of Salento, says that they make a great dish.He is encouraging everyone to have them on their dinner tables.He said in December: \u0026ldquoWe need to adapt, to turn this problem into an opportunity.\u0026ldquoWe started to analyse the chemical composition of jellyfish in the Mediterranean and realised that they were similar to the ones eaten in the far east.

The middle is usually eaten, and not the tentacles.Professor Silvio Greco said that it reminds him of oysters.Last month, researchers from the University of Southern Denmark developed a way to make jellyfish chips which had a crunchy texture.Mr Pirano said: \u0026ldquoWe need to train fishermen so we can get some value from this unused biomass.\u0026rdquo                            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/magaluf-tourists-948924.jpg","title":"Majorca tourist crackdown british holidays british tourists pub crawl","story":"GETTYMagaluf: Police stepped in on the pub crawl over strict new rulesCouncil officials said the high jinks were completely contrary to the new set of regulations which are now in force in the popular tourist resort in a bid to cut out drunken behaviour and unsightly scenes which are deemed anti-social and uncivic.The 90 tourists were on a pub crawl and had already visited two pubs.

Two guides of Irish nationality, who are currently staying in Magaluf, accompanied the group of customers who had purchased a ticket worth two euros in exchange for two drinks.Police also collected advertising that encourages the consumption of alcohol with free shots all night and rounds, in addition to announcing other events such as wet shirts. In fact, the t-shirt that the pub crawlers wore advertised an open bar, a mechanical bull, a shower of champagne, gifts on the spot and crazy drinking games.The spokesman continued: It should be remembered that, according to the municipal ordinance of pub crawling, the promoters of the activity will be responsible for possible sanctions as well as the premises that host the activity.Thus, one of the entertainment venues has been denounced with a very serious fault for exercising an activity without the mandatory municipal licence, which entails a fine of up to 3,000 euros.Majorca tourist nightmare: Boozy law-breaking Britons strip naked in the street                    Splash1 of 11Magaluf mayhem: Boozy law-breaking Britons strip naked in the streetAnother of the establishments has committed a serious infraction for breach of the conditions of the licence, which may involve a penalty of up to 1,500 euros. On the other hand, none of the group\u0027s guides exhibited the pertinent accreditation, for which a minor infraction is filed, which can be punished with up to \u0026euro 750 per person.According to municipal regulations, pub crawling routes can only be carried out between 8pm and midnight. The activity licence, the advertising proposal, and the routes must be reported to the council at least one week in advance.The maximum number of participants in a pub crawl is 20 people of legal age who wear a T-shirt that identifies them as members of the group. In addition, it is forbidden to announce anything that encourages the consumption of alcohol, the practise of sexual games, or activity that may alter the rest of residents and public order.The guides must be identified and registered with an employment contract, and be accompanied by an accredited and authorised security guard, as well as having civil liability insurance.These guides need to have specific training in first aid, and wear an identification vest. The local recipients of this type of excursion must have a risk mitigation plan and have special control over the capacity, says the council.It is unlikely that the pub crawlers themselves will be fined on this occasion but Calvia council, which governs Magaluf and neighbouring tourist hotspots, has warned of a new raft of fines for anyone found exhibiting anti-social behaviour such as being drunk, naked or semi-naked, drinking in the street etc.The new season is about to get underway and there will be more police on the streets and more inspections in a bid to rid the resort of its old image.

Fidel and Ra\u0026uacutel were together from their first attack on Cuba\u0027s US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1953, when a failed assault on military barracks put both brothers in jail.On their release it was Ra\u0026uacutel who first met Argentinian doctor Ernesto Che Guevara in Mexico, recruiting followers for their planned invasion of their homeland.The brothers Castro, with Guevara and 79 others, sailed to Cuba in 1956, hiding in the mountains where they launched a guerrilla campaign, finally taking the capital Havana in 1959 and ousting Batista.The Castros assassinated thousands of opponents and jailed many more as they consolidated their power and aligned with the Soviet Union, which flooded Cuba with weapons.After surviving more than 600 assassination attempts, defying 10 US Presidents and shaping half a century of history, Fidel Castro died aged 90, on 25th November 2016.                    REUTERS1 of 28File photo of Cuba\u0027s President Fidel Castro during a visit to ParisIt was this arms escalation that led a terrified America to plot Castro\u0027s overthrow.In April 1961 an army of 1,400 CIA-trained Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of Pigs in a bid to overthrow the Communists.The invasion was a debacle, defeated within three days and served only to cement Fidel Castro\u0027s reputation as a national hero.Fearing further attack, he negotiated with Russia to position Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba, prompting threats of American retaliation.Direct action against Cuba would mean nuclear war, warned Guevara, as Fidel Castro pleaded with Russia to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the US.After tense days on the brink of nuclear Armageddon, the Soviets agreed to remove all their missiles from Cuba, and in return extracted a secret agreement from the US to extract its missiles from Turkey.But the CIA had not finished with the man known as El Comandante, launching years of increasingly outrageous assassination attempts.In all, Castro survived 634 attempts on his life, according to his secret service chief.These are the pictures the world\u0027s dictators don\u0027t want you to see.

GETTY1 of 23Hitler strikes a pose for photographer Heinrich Hoffmann whilst listening to a recording of his own speechesThe CIA tried to poison his favourite cigars, stab him with a poisoned pen, supplied hit-men with poison pills, and gave Castro\u0027s tro\u0027s lover Marita Lorenz poison to slip into his drink.Castro\u0027s passion for scuba ing inspired the CIA to contaminate his ing suit and breathing regulator with a fungal infection, and hide explosives inside a large seashell that would be placed underwater for Castro to find - a scheme discarded as impractical.Thwarted, the US sought to contain Cuba with a combination of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation.Cuba Fidel Castro, his beret cocked at a rakish angle, a fat cigar buried in his bushy beard and often clad in drab olive army fatigues, became the face of the Cuban revolution for five decades until handing over power to Ra\u0026uacutel in 2006, and stepping down as president two years later.He died in 2016 aged 90.Ra\u0026uacutel, who brokered a detente with America two years ago, opening up trade and tourism, has not entirely vanished: he remains the powerful leader of Cuba\u0027s Communist Party.Cubans now wait to see whether new president Diaz-Canel, 58 today, will continue on his predecessor\u0027s path.As many Cubans call for a more dynamic future open to the global economy, the country remains plagued by shortages.Diaz-Canel\u0027s leadership may be defined by how well he balances the competing forces of preserving the Castros\u0027 legacy - socialised medicine and education - with the needs of a new generation.
