I’m not comfortable with my breasts out just shooting the s**t with you,\u0027\u0027\u0027 she says.  \u0027He smears the gel on with his hands and NO GLOVES on and when he glides the ultrasound wand thing over my breasts he drags his fingers on them and it f**ing bothers me.\u0027Again, AS I TOLD HIM LAST YEAR, I said \u0027\u0027Hey! Do you need to be touching me with your fingers\u0027\u0027 He said \u0027\u0027No\u0027\u0027. And he pulled them off of me. Then he added \u0027\u0027I do that for balance.\u0027\u0027 I said \u0027\u0027Well I believe in you and I think you can do with without your fingers on me.\u0027\u0027\u0027  The comedian said she is not accusing him of being sleazy, but instead is urging women to speak up when they feel uncomfortableSilverman then admits that she is not accusing the doctor having any sexual intention but highlights that as a professional, he should be aware of how the situation can be uncomfortable for women. \u0027Look, I truly don’t think he was getting off on it, BUT it is his job to be aware that this is vulnerable for a woman. Wear f***ing GLOVES - this isn’t a date. \u0027For him to be so arrogant that he didn’t even internalize the problem when I said something to him about it last year is obnoxious and probably a subconscious power thing if we’re getting deep.\u0027TOM LEONARD: Bloody hypocrites of Hollywood are in a rage...AOC dons a CAPE and dresses in white to honor the...Share this articleSilverman says that this was her last mammogram with this \u0027dude\u0027 or \u0027any dude\u0027 for that matter.    \u0027I’m a grown woman and I’m fine. But this guy does this with everyone and I know that personally it took many years into adulthood before I spoke up for myself. \u0027It’s uncomfortable and too easy to think it’s all in your head. And arrogant f**ks like this doctor take advantage of women’s socialized instinct to not speak up.\u0027She then offers a message to her fans. \u0027All this to say speak up. Trust that thing in your gut that tells you this s**t ain’t right.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Porsche 911 driver blocks two parking spaces Hull supermarket","story":"    An outraged motorist took a photograph of the Porsche 911  Carerra S which was blocking two paces at a car park near the Sainsbury\u0027s supermarket in Willerby Square, Hull during Wednesday\u0027s school run          The incident happened near the Sainsbury\u0027s Local store on Willerby Square, Hull, picturedIt caught the attention of fellow drivers who accused the driver of parking this way because he \u0027didn\u0027t want his doors scratched\u0027.Porsche 911s start off at around £80,000, but the price soon increases depending on the specifications and whether it is a track-focussed car like the GT3 which can cost more than £140,000.  A user of the car park, who did not want to be named, said: \u0027Porsche 911s cost £145,000.

Susannah Constantine \u0027still get schoolgirl crushes\u0027So, Christie Brinkley jokes that she\u0027s turning 50 for the 15th time, declaring her spirit age is far younger than her 65 years. Why has she chosen an age that is ten years older than she looks?When it comes to how I feel, I\u0027d put it at somewhere around 16. I still get schoolgirl crushes and it would be wonderful to have no responsibilities. Often, I see myself in my children and it makes me laugh when I tell them to behave or grow up, when inside I\u0027m wanting to do exactly the same as them, despite the statins, hot flushes and insomnia.I yearn to eat rubbish as often as I like without pumping up the cholesterol levels. I\u0027d love to be able to sleep until noon. It would be heaven to have a night on the tiles and not look like stale bread the next morning.Sadly, at the ripe old age of 56, it would be unwise to live my spiritual age because it could take me to an early grave.    Henry Deedes\u0027s spirit age is the age he got married My spirit age — 28 — is the age I got married. That\u0027s not a dig at my ex-wife, we had many wonderful times. Still do. But I feel younger now than I did then.Midlife complacency set in prematurely after marrying. The burden of responsibility meant I neglected myself.Week nights covering the canape-and-Krug party circuit had left my skin sallow, my belly blubberous. Home life was often a whir of bills and builders as I tottered under the weight of a mortgage bigger than the Brexit orce fee.These days, I eat better, drink less and am mildly more solvent. Frequent exercise means I can wear T-shirts again without feeling like a lager-tummied extra from Benidorm. That feeling of youthful spontaneity is wonderful. I have a sense of adventure again.Every now and again I get a quick reality check. Hangovers get harder. Hair gets greyer. And yesterday I ordered a hip support from Amazon to wear in the gym — but let\u0027s not dwell on that.CHILDREN CAN TELL I\u0027M NOT A GROWN-UPRowan PellingReal age: 51. Spirit age: 15.I have never lied about my age and told everyone when I turned 50 last year. But that might be because I am certain, deep down, that the largest part of me remains resolutely 15.          Rowan Pelling never lied about her age I have spent my life avoiding certain adult responsibilities (tax returns, form-filling, housework, the duller side of childrearing) and veering off into my own vivid, imaginary world.I still make the kind of intense friendships I made at school and like sloping away from chores like a naughty schoolgirl having a ciggie behind the bike sheds.My life would have fallen apart, I suspect, if I hadn\u0027t married a proper grown-up who provides the necessary domestic balance. I happily wear clothes many peers would judge to be age-inappropriate, such as skinny jeans, short skirts and bikinis, and only yesterday I received a Sex Pistols T-shirt in the post.Children (little girls in particular) often recognise I\u0027m not a real grown-up and are happy to talk to me about unicorns, imaginary friends and dragons. If there\u0027s a trampoline or a game of \u0027It\u0027, I\u0027m first in the queue.My chief guilty pleasure is nestling in an armchair with a clutch of favourite children\u0027s books.I don\u0027t think I chase youth: I\u0027ve never had Botox or filler and I\u0027m happy with my wrinkles. But I suspect feeling young is what makes a person buzz, not looking it. If I were ever to have a tattoo, then it would say simply: \u0027There are no rules.\u0027IN MY DREAMS I\u0027M 17 AND A RUGBY HEROStanley JohnsonReal age: 78. Spirit age: 17.          Stanley Johnson dreams of being a rugby hero Even now, I dream about my schooldays when I played prop in rugby for Sherborne, aged 17.The other side (Marlborough? Clifton?) kicks off. I catch the ball full-toss and charge straight for the line, looking neither right nor left, to score under the posts.Of course, I\u0027m not arguing that the grit and determination you acquire on the rugger field as a schoolboy is the end of the story. Yes, I wanted to gain a rugger blue at Oxford after I left school, but I also wanted to get a First and be President of the Union.As it happened, I flunked all three goals, but there was one great consolation prize which I have cherished all my life: I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a 98-line poem called May Morning. I had to recite it at the university\u0027s summer prize-giving ceremony, Encaenia.Charlie Chaplin was one of those honoured that year. He signed my programme and, 56 years later, I still have it.In a nutshell, my spirit age still hovers around 17. I have the sense that even though I hung up my boots years ago, it\u0027s worth charging full-tilt towards the goal.BEING A YOUNG DAD WAS THE BEST TIMERay ConnollyReal age: 78. Spirit age: 29.Emotionally frozen at the age of 29, that\u0027s what I was. That\u0027s how I still think of myself.It was the age when I became confident that I knew how to do what I was good at.We bought a big, run-down house on my 29th birthday in 1970 and it felt like a new beginning, setting off on a new adventure with a future rich in hope and possibilities.          Ray Connolly is \u0027frozen at the age of 29\u0027That was also the time when I was a young father. I liked the role of being a dad — I still do. Not the sort of dad who helped much around the house, more the type who saw children as people to amuse and who enjoyed being amused by them.I expect lots of men identify with being in their late teens — which suggests to me they must have had more success with girls at that age than I did. Marrying Plum when I was 25 was the best thing I ever did. We\u0027ve grown old together, but still reckon the years when the children were small were the best.It was hard, of course. Not much money, two children and soon another on the way, redecorating all four floors of our home in the evenings — Wedgwood blue and white panels nearly everywhere.Not everything has turned out as I hoped. There have been some mistakes — like selling that perfect house — and setbacks. But I\u0027m still happily working seven days a week, still getting new ideas and beginning new projects. Still feeling all of 29.WE GRANNIES ARE FULL OF ENERGYLynne FranksReal age: 70. Spirit age: 30.I have been in my early 30s for almost 40 years. Although clearly my body is older, my enthusiasm for new projects and my energy are the same, and my creativity is as full-on.          Lynne Franks has \u0027been in my early 30s for almost 40 years\u0027At 70, I am opening three new businesses, have moved to a new home in Somerset where I\u0027ve never lived before, and am still optimistic about love and romance.I know good health is vital to keeping up my energy and I eat well, take the best natural supplements and stay as physically active as I have time for, with regular boxing sessions, daily dog walks, tennis lessons and dancing.But I think it\u0027s my love of life and excitement for what each day will bring that keep me feeling less than half my biological age.I meet so many women in my work as a coach and mentor who are my age and planning their next career. It\u0027s as if being grandmothers and well past the menopause has given us a new lease of life.Laughter, love, creative ideas, hugs and a belief that we can work together to create a new and better kind of world is what keeps me and my friends spiritually 30.IS IT TIME I FOUND A PROPER JOB?Libby PurvesReal age: 69. Spirit age: 27.If you\u0027re a freelance, your spirit age stays shamefully young. Actors and musicians know the feeling, too, and I suspect a lot of us still unconsciously feel about 27.It\u0027s understandable: you have never been a serious employee, corporate executive or brisk office manager never been eligible for a company pension, sick pay, maternity leave or an unfair-dismissal tribunal. So you roam the landscape as bright-eyed and wary as a weasel.          Libby Purves says freelancing keeps you \u0027shamefully young\u0027You always wonder about the next contract or the next gig, and never mind being busy you remember how the young Roy Hudd, complaining of overwork, was told by a grand, old, end-of-the-pier agent: \u0027Roy, a full date-book is a happy pro!\u0027You rather relish the sense of adventure involved in professional insecurity, wondering who might try to hire you next and if you would match up to their style, or be able to tolerate the management\u0027s notorious attitude problem.Like a twentysomething between boyfriends, you have a giddy sense that something intriguing and wonderful might be just around the corner. And when it isn\u0027t, you learn to laugh it off and scrounge around for anything that\u0027s going.Yet you\u0027re not a callow teenager: by the mid-20s you had learned to accept nasty rejection without falling into a furious depression.At the same time, you have started to know your value and your price and nerve yourself occasionally to say: \u0027No.\u0027But always there\u0027s that roving eye for a new chance, and a faint sense that maybe you ought to be looking for a \u0027proper job\u0027.Even when I had two small children and lived in a Suffolk field, it was impossible not to read the situations vacant column and go into some mad fantasy of retraining as a psychiatric nurse, PE teacher or automotive bodyshop manager.And, shame to say, I still do.Royalty, presidents and \u0027the most famous elevator ride in...Michael Avenatti\u0027s estranged wife says she wishes he would...\u0027She is super smart and has great energy\u0027: Stormy Daniels\u0027...Firing up viewers: Today scores best ratings in two years...Share this article    Roger Alton says his body feels 171My passport says I\u0027m 71, but most of the time my body feels 171.Especially in the morning (come on knees, do your stuff and get out of bed) or the afternoon (try not to snooze with your mouth open), not to mention the evening (have a shower, not a bath, or you\u0027ll never get out). Then there\u0027s the nights (not the bloody loo again).All a bit embarrassing for a chap who still thinks he\u0027s 34 — physically, socially and professionally in the prime of life, with a rich circle of sporting and friendship associates.

But we\u0027d love it if you would make the tea.\u0027I am not alone: Sergio Parisse, veteran captain of the beleaguered Italian rugby team, was asked if he was thinking of retiring before his team played Scotland last weekend.Not really, he said. \u0027In my head I\u0027m still 16.\u0027I know how he feels. Now, if I can only get up and head for bed . . .YES, THERE\u0027S LIFE BEYOND STRICTLYJohn SergeantReal age: 74. Spirit Age: 74.          John Sergeant feels his exact age I get worried when a young person says: \u0027I\u0027m going to go round the world and try to find myself.\u0027This attempt is unlikely to succeed — for we have many selves, from diligent child to grumpy old man, via many other characters on the way.One of my great joys has been being able to take part in a contrasting range of activities, be it Strictly Come Dancing or reporting Parliament and, somehow, making each one my own.To thine own self be true — but I have preferred to be true to mine own selves.My spirit age is highly variable. Sometimes I feel like a teenager, reluctant to get out of bed in the morning. Running up stairs is now a fairly rare pleasure — I am more likely to imagine that my 90th birthday looms.My spirit age also changes as the year progresses. At the moment I have adapted well to being 74.I feel plenty of adventures still lie ahead. But in just over two months I will be 75, and that is a source of unease.I think the best plan is to set my spirit age at 74 until I am ready to take stock."},{"url":null,"title":"Speeding Navy cadets clocked 99 points just four months them","story":"    Two Qatari naval officer cadets clocked up 99 speeding points but failed to turn up in Newton Abbot Magistrates’ CourtHe was found guilty and fined a total of £7,810, ordered to pay a £77 victim surcharge and £85 costs.He racked up a total of 61 points on his licence and was banned from driving for four years.Al-Mahmoud was charged with 10 counts between April and June 2018, one of which was driving at 97mph in a 70mph zone on Haldon Hill near Exeter, Devon.He was found guilty and fined a total of £4,840, ordered to pay a £77 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

Mr Cook gave evidence to the Nottingham hearing on its ninth day after deciding to attend in person. He told coroner Laurinda Bower how he and Kelly met around 2000 and had two children before splitting on Christmas Eve 2012, when he moved out of the family home Mr Cook said he last saw his children in early 2013, when Amber was 10, and took them for a meal in a pub. He claimed she was \u0027happy and cheerful\u0027 – until he said he had to take her home.Asked by Ms Bower why that was the final time he saw them, Mr Cook replied: \u0027My shifts were all over the place.I tried to ring Kelly and said I would be off this week, and Kelly said I could not see them at the drop of a hat.\u0027I would ring and it would be, \u0027we are going here\u0027, or \u0027we are going there.\u0027\u0027\u0027Every time I phoned her it would be \u0027inconvenient\u0027. There would be \u0027family business\u0027 to see to, or \u0027we are taking them here, or there\u0027.\u0027The last time was a heated discussion. It was getting to the point where you are beaten down by it. I wanted to see the children.\u0027Mr Cook said that during their last conversation, Kelly told him: \u0027You just can\u0027t see them when you want to.\u0027          Danny Peat told Amber\u0027s estranged father: \u0027She is not your f****** daughter. She wants nothing to do with you. You are nothing but a sperm donor.\u0027The inquest heard he considered talking to a solicitor, but didn\u0027t feel he \u0027had a leg to stand on\u0027.At some point around March 2013, he went to their home – but found it was empty.Mr Cook said: \u0027I went to a friends\u0027 house on the estate, but they said that one morning they woke up and they had upped and gone. I had no idea where they\u0027d gone.\u0027He added the next contact he had with the Peats was on the day after Amber disappeared.Mr Cook told the hearing: \u0027I found out in Facebook so I tried to contact Kelly with the number off the missing person posters.\u0027I got vile abuse off Danny – \u0027she is not your f****** daughter, she wants nothing to do with you, you are nothing but a sperm donor.  Mr Cook said he didn\u0027t know about any issues surrounding his daughter that the inquest had heard about, including her running away from home previously and problems at school\u0027I phoned back again and spoke to Danny\u0027s mum. I didn\u0027t get much information. I was in deep shock about it.\u0027He added he didn\u0027t know about any issues surrounding his daughter that the inquest had heard about, including her running away from home previously and problems at school.Mr Cook\u0027s mum Jennifer Lancaster – Amber\u0027s grandmother – then gave evidence.She described her granddaughter as a \u0027lovely, sweet, lovable child\u0027 who \u0027liked to cuddle and play silly girly things like dressing up, and with her make-up bag\u0027.Mrs Lancaster said she saw Amber \u0027quite frequently\u0027 when she was young – but when her son and Kelly split up she only saw her \u0027two or three\u0027 times before her death.One of the occasions was Valentines\u0027 Day in 2013, when Danny wanted to cook Kelly a \u0027romantic meal\u0027 and the children went to stay with her for the weekend.  Amber Peat\u0027s biological father Adrian Cook (left) arrived at the inquest of his daughter\u0027s death for the first time today, as the 13-year-old tragic schoolgirl\u0027s grandparents prepared to give evidence But Mrs Lancaster said Amber was \u0027weepy\u0027 because she had overheard a conversation between Kelly and her mum, Dianne Gillibrand, in which they had said she \u0027wouldn\u0027t want them.\u0027Mrs Lancaster said: \u0027I told them I would always want them. How can you not want two little children like that, that give you so much pleasure?\u0027It struck me as odd.\u0027Mrs Lancaster next saw the young siblings on Mother\u0027s Day 2013, but they couldn\u0027t stop for long because Kelly was waiting in her car outside. She gave them a pair of charm bracelets, and expected to see them again before she went into hospital that April for a knee operation – but never did.She told the hearing: \u0027I got a message from Kelly to say they loved the bracelets, and that was it.\u0027I bought them Easter eggs and sent a message to see if they would be coming for them. And I wanted to get Amber a birthday present because I was going in hospital. But the message (back) was, \u0027don\u0027t know, not sure\u0027. That was it.\u0027          Kelly Peat showed \u0027no emotion\u0027 after the 13-year-old fled and gave \u0027rehearsed\u0027 information to police before putting Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027, a police officer who was called to the incident saidMrs Lancaster added that she went to the family home in a bid to see them – but found they had moved.When she contacted Kelly to ask for the new address – only to be told: \u0027I am not comfortable with you having it.\u0027She said: \u0027I thought, \u0027this is really strange\u0027, but that is the way it was.\u0027Mrs Lancaster found out Amber had gone missing through her sister, and \u0027panicked\u0027. She said she had no concerns about her granddaughter\u0027s behaviour, and what had happened \u0027came as a shock\u0027.Referring to the Peats, she said: \u0027They trust you with their kids and then stop you seeing them, and the next thing you know she is missing.\u0027It\u0027s horrible, it really is horrible.\u0027I phoned Kelly\u0027s number and Danny answered, and I said, \u0027where is my granddaughter?\u0027 I said I need to speak to Kelly. He said, \u0027she does not want anything to do with that side of the family.\u0027 So what do you do?\u0027Pausing to wipe away tears, Mrs Lancaster added: \u0027When she (Amber) passed away, I did not even get to see her at the undertakers. They had to contact Kelly.\u0027I did not realise until that point just how cruel she could be. And it is cruel. That is how it is.\u0027 As the inquest into Peat\u0027s death in 2015 continued into it\u0027s second week, a coroner heard she stormed out of the family home after being told to \u0027wash every pot in the house\u0027.On one occasion, Peat had been woken at 1.30am and told to mop the floors, the inquest in Nottingham was told.In yesterday\u0027s hearing, Kelly Peat showed \u0027no emotion\u0027 after the 13-year-old fled and gave \u0027rehearsed\u0027 information to police before putting Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027, a police officer who was called to the incident said.Amber\u0027s mother and step-father Danny Peat didn\u0027t report her missing for almost eight hours after going to the supermarket and having supper. It came as the last man to see her alive told the Nottingham inquest into her death that detectives turned up at his door two days after he reported it to them.Adam Lamb said the police asked if they could walk to where he last spotted Amber at 5.20pm on May 30 2015 and she was found hanging in the hedgerow nearby.\u0027Alarm bells\u0027 were ringing at school over \u0027Cinderella\u0027 girl,...\u0027Cinderella\u0027 schoolgirl Amber Peat, 13, who ran away from...Tragic schoolgirl, 13, found hanged in a bush was LAUGHED at...Social worker says she felt there was \u0027no immediate risk\u0027 to...\u0027I haven\u0027t got anything happy to write about\u0027: What...Girl, 13, made \u0027running away list\u0027 before she fled her home...Share this articleThe coroner has been told the vulnerable teenager was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 at home and subjected to a series of draconian punishments for \u0027undesirable behaviour\u0027.On one occasion, she claimed she had been been awoken by her stepfather at 1.30am and told to mop floors as a punishment for failing to fulfil domestic chores. Amber vanished at around 5.10pm – but wasn\u0027t reported missing until 12.56am the following day, after her parents had their dinner and went shopping.          Daniel Peat said to police that Amber\u0027s her \u0027only hobby was reading and she had no real friends\u0027Tragically  she was already dead by that point.The eighth day of the four-week inquest heard from PC Nicola Roe, who was one of the first officers to respond to the missing persons call from Kelly.She went to the family home with a colleague and was told by the 37-year-old that Amber had stormed out of the house after being asked to clean out a cool box.Asked by coroner Laurinda Bower for her observations about Kelly, PC Roe replied: \u0027She was quite matter-of-fact about how she was describing the situation.\u0027The officer said she \u0027wasn\u0027t really surprised\u0027 because \u0027people present differently\u0027, adding: \u0027She seemed tired but not particularly emotional. Not upset, maybe frustrated.\u0027She explained the background that she had gone missing previously in similar circumstances, and referred to her throwing temper tantrums and attention-seeking behaviour.\u0027PC Roe said the family \u0027seemed quite well rehearsed in giving information to the police\u0027, and \u0027the general consensus was they expected her back the next morning\u0027.She added: \u0027They said she normally came back at night and that is why they left it quite late to report it.\u0027          Kelly Peat, and step father Danny Peat appeal for missing Amber to come home - but by that time she was already dead          The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing The inquest also heard from PC Kay Yelland, who visited the family home more than 24 hours after Amber walked out in order to \u0027gain more information\u0027, and found a \u0027group of people\u0027 gathered there.Asked by Ms Bower if the atmosphere was \u0027emotionally charged\u0027 and \u0027people were upset\u0027, PC Yelland replied: \u0027No, not really.\u0027She added the response at the property was \u0027just matter-of-fact\u0027 when quizzed by the coroner about how she\u0027d describe it.PC Yelland went on to tell the hearing about a comment Amber\u0027s stepdad, Danny Peat, made about her.  Amber Peat wrote to her mother Kelly  telling her: \u0027I just wanted to be you little girl again\u0027 - but she laughed at it, the inquest heard previously She said: \u0027He told me her only hobby was reading and she had no real friends.\u0027The inquest heard Amber\u0027s disappearance was initially classed as \u0027medium\u0027 risk before later being upgraded to \u0027high\u0027 – although this wouldn\u0027t have made a \u0027material difference\u0027 to the response.Chief Inspector Christopher Sullivan said: \u0027It felt very much to me this was a teenager, albeit only just a teenager, who had pushed the boundaries beyond what they normally had, and although there was concern, medium risk was appropriate.\u0027Ms Bower then read a statement from Mansfield resident Adam Lamb who told how he saw a girl, thought to be Amber, at around 5.50pm on the day she went missing.He described how he and his wife were cleaning their cars when he spotted a young girl approach.Mr Lamb said: \u0027She was walking towards me. I was blocking the pavement and I began to move out of the way.\u0027She looked at me and smiled as if to say thanks. She was chewing on her left sleeve.\u0027I watched her approach the junction. She then walked across the junction and onto a green area. She then began hanging around the leafy area.\u0027I thought it was odd she was hanging around there on her own. I spoke to my wife briefly and moments later she was no longer there.\u0027 Mr Lamb added he thought the girl had \u0027walked off\u0027.He contacted police with the sighting the following day after his wife saw a news story about Amber\u0027s disappearance on Facebook.The inquest heard two officers went to the area – but they didn\u0027t speak to Mr Lamb and failed to spot Amber.Two days later Mr Lamb was visited by a detective, who asked him to show where he had last seen the girl.Detective Constable Karl Aram told the court how they \u0027stumbled across\u0027 a tiny gap in the \u0027very dense\u0027 hedgerow – and when he leant inside he immediately saw a girl\u0027s body.He added: \u0027She was facing me. It was immediately clear to me she was dead. She was completely motionless.\u0027The officer added he could sign no sign that a note had been left.The inquest continues. "},{"url":null,"title":"Polar bear sticks tongue laughing seagull Svalbard","story":"    Hilarious pictured showed the jubilant polar bear appearing to stick its tongue out at a seagull as it feasted on the body of a seal          A group of seagulls stood around the enormous predator as it dined in Norway\u0027s remote Svalbard islands in the Arctic circleIf you thought the Polar Vortex was bad, wait til you get...Spring in the city (in February)!

Painted in 2018 as we stumbled towards the Brexit crisis that is now upon us, its title seems plain enough. This is a remainer’s alienated view of Brexit England as a strange, bigoted neighbour skulking behind a nationalist fence. Yet there’s a twist – or two. The red cross on the flag is the cross of St George, and it’s been painted by a man called George. There is a white cross inside the red one – what does that mean? This may be a more private and quirky symbol than we know perhaps it is even religious. Since Shaw, who was raised Catholic, makes similarly subtle religious allusions in many of his paintings, that does not seem a far-fetched interpretation.In other words, Shaw is not outside the scene. He’s not looking down on people who choose to put up a flag, shuddering at the millions who voted leave. On the contrary, he’s the artist of the left behind, in more ways than one. He paints left-behind people and left-behind cats and dogs. Or rather left-behind pubs, lockups and care homes, for there are no people in most of Shaw’s scenes. The only human figure in his mini-retrospective at Bath’s Holburne Museum is the artist himself, pissing against a tree in his picture The Call of Nature.Shaw’s style, too, is left behind. A survey last year produced the interesting claim that leave voters are more likely to prefer old-fashioned realistic art while remainers like abstraction. If so, Shaw may be the only person who can reunite Britain. He has been shortlisted for the avant-garde Turner prize, yet the exactness and attention to detail of his paintings ought to satisfy the most conservative eye. Painting does not get more proper. Shaw has something of the outsider artist about him, so innocently and arduously does he pursue his calling. He uses Humbrol aircraft modelling paints that give an enamelled sharpness and shine to his art. His stylistic sources, you suspect, include the meticulous portrayals of Spitfires and Lancasters he’d have seen as a kid on model aircraft kits.Yet his meditation on what the art historian Nikolaus Pevsner called “the Englishness of English art” goes deeper than that. Shaw revisits the landscape art of Gainsborough and Constable that is so often taken as quintessentially British, or English. He haunts the same kinds of woodlands they did and shares their eye for nature the trees in his paintings have such vivid personalities they can stand in for the absent people. Blossoming in spring or bereft in winter with black finger-like branches twisting against the sky, they are witnesses to his state of mind.And what a troubled state of mind it is. John Constable said he was inspired to paint by his “boyhood scenes”, and so is Shaw. But while Constable grew up in the Suffolk countryside that his paintings immortalise, Shaw grew up in the 1970s and 80s on Tile Hill estate on the outskirts of Coventry. This is the place he obsessively paints. He depicts the house where he lived as a child, a tree he could see out of his window, and woods close to the houses. Tile Hill was designed as a pastoral blend of nature and modern planning. As it has decayed before Shaw’s eyes, it has become a monstrous landscape of disillusion and betrayal.The Age of Bullshit has a perfect title for our present moment, but this painting of a derelict modernist pub dates from 2010, the year David Cameron became prime minister. The Tile Hill pub was once a symbol of – planned – community. Now its roof has gone and its gutted shell is fenced off. This is just one of the images of decline and decay that fill Shaw’s ruinous pastoral. In Scenes from the Passion: The Fall a row of tatty lock-ups, unloved and partly disused, is reflected in muddy puddles and overshadowed by winter trees against a yellow sky.Shaw’s childhood world has been left behind not just by time but social change. His most frightening paintings are of forbidding walls closed against the world: The Back That Used to Be the Front is a boarded-up facade covered in hostile graffiti. The sealed-off house that sports the flag of St George is another of these images of aggressive exclusion. And where have all those people gone?When George Shaw started to paint Tile Hill and its environs in the 1990s, modern Britain was being hyped as a happy place with a glowing future. His paintings, however, stank of rain, mud and misery. Now we know the hype was a lie. If the EU referendum and its aftermath have proved anything, it is that much of Britain feels as fed up, short-changed and bereft as these paintings make it look. Yet there is hope in Shaw’s vision. This sensitive, loving artist is not an ironist. He’s utterly sincere. Catholic imagery keeps welling up. His Ash Wednesday paintings portray moments of redemptive promise among spring trees and silent houses. Is that the shadow of Christ cast against a wall by a gnarled tree? Shaw has an alternative vision for Britain. Like William Blake or John Ruskin, he thinks we can be better than we are. Salvation is close at hand, if we could open our boarded windows and let in the light."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f98bef9f447d083e0acc77ada913fb0673426a05/30_178_2020_1212/master/2020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5babe4bcac0cbe7da3487af9c5f55ef9","title":"the transcontinental railroad at 150 in pictures","story":"In a new travelling exhibition, the significance of the transcontinental railroad, finished in 1869, will be celebrated in a series of images capturing its arduous construction through to its triumphant completion.

But a discovery in the British Council’s archives has revealed that after commissioning the essay, it declined to publish it, telling Orwell that it was problematic to write about food in a time of strict rationing.“I am so sorry such a seemingly stupid situation has arisen with your manuscript,” runs the letter, raising “doubts on such a treatment of the painful subject of Food in these times”. The publications department representative tells Orwell he has written “a good essay … apart from one or two minor criticisms, I think it is excellent,” but that “it would be unfortunate and unwise to publish it for the continental reader”.Orwell went on to publish a shorter version of the essay in the Evening Standard. “It seems that the organisation in those days was somewhat po-faced and risk-averse, and was anxious to avoid producing an essay about food (even one that mentions the disastrous effects of wartime rationing) in the aftermath of the hungry winter of 1945,” said editor Alasdair Donaldson. “Over 70 years later, the British Council is delighted to make amends for its slight on perhaps the UK’s greatest political writer of the 20th century, by reproducing the original essay in full.”Featuring Orwell’s recipes for plum cake, Christmas pudding, and orange marmalade – of which the British Council editor declared: “Bad recipe! – Too much sugar and water” – the essay sees the novelist taking on the “simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous diet” of the British, which he finds draws “much of its virtue from the excellence of the local materials, and with its main emphasis on sugar and animal fats”.“It is the diet of a wet northern country where butter is plentiful and vegetable oils are scarce, where hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day, and where all the spices and some of the stronger-tasting herbs are exotic products,” he writes. “In general, British people prefer sweet things to spicy things, and they combine sugar with meat in a way that is seldom seen elsewhere.”He has more praise for “one of the greatest glories of British cookery – its puddings”, in particular plum pudding and the boiled apple dumpling. But he warns his readers away from the milk puddings that are “unfortunately, characteristic of Britain. They are preparations of rice, semolina, barley, sago or even macaroni, mixed with milk and sugar and baked in the oven. The one made with barley is somewhat less bad than the others: the one made with macaroni is intolerable to any civilised palate,” he says.After a long digression about high tea, Orwell explains that “the two great shortcomings of British cookery are a failure to treat vegetables with due seriousness, and an excessive use of sugar”, but urges readers to try the best of British food – in his opinion, apples, salt fish, oysters, biscuits, and jams and jellies.“No one who has not sampled Devonshire cream, stilton cheese, crumpets, potato cakes, saffron buns, Dublin prawns, apple dumplings, pickled walnuts, steak-and-kidney pudding and, of course, roast sirloin of beef with Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes and horseradish sauce, can be said to have given British cookery a fair trial,” he advises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cff86671501143bc69220fafbfd6c85185a4f9dc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c99b95334e6c4287ce440f1125d1a189","title":"rutger bregman winnie byanyima anand giridharadas","story":"When Rutger Bregman and Winnie Byanyima spoke out about taxes at Davos they went viral. They talk with Winners Take All author Anand Giridharadas about why change is comingRutger: Winnie, why did the comments you and I made about billionaires and taxes at Davos go viral? Why do things seem to be changing right now?Winnie: Why did we go viral? I think we said things that people have wanted to hear, especially on a big stage where powerful politicians and companies are represented. And they are rarely said. People go there and speak in coded words and praise themselves and spin out the stats that suit them, but for once we spoke plainly about the challenges that people face.R: I saw some interesting stats today from Gallup that suggest that since the end of the 1990s, the vast majority of people in the US have wanted the rich to pay more taxes. There are signs that there is a profound shift in the public mood.W: I don’t know whether the left has been sleeping, but there has been a dominant narrative that has remained quite unchallenged in the media. This narrative suggests that there is no connection between the super-rich and abject poverty, that you can keep getting richer and richer, and this has nothing to do with people getting poorer. And it wasn’t always like that, people in the past have known that maximising at the top means you are depriving somebody else further down. It’s empowering for people to hear that truth being put on the table again.Anand: The idea of the narrative is so important. I think that what you both found yourselves in the middle of at Davos, and what I found myself in on my book tour over the last few months, and what politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have found themselves in the middle of, is the growing challenge to a kind of bullshit narrative around wealth and poverty, access and power it’s completely wrong and fraudulent, and it’s now crashing down. There is a second narrative about how the world is getting better and better: people in India and China and elsewhere have been coming out of poverty, and the world is the best it’s ever been. Never mind the fact that we’re perhaps 50 years away from catastrophic climate change fuelled by greed. That narrative, too, has had a free ride in the press and culture, including on the left, until now. And then there is a final narrative of companies and billionaires – as long as they are doing good things, we don’t ask what else they do as long as they are giving back, we don’t ask how they made their money. It’s like a mafia deal: no questions asked.R: I agree. I think that for a very long time, politicians on both the left and the right have believed that most wealth is created at the top. The brilliant entrepreneurs, the visionaries, they are the job creators. The right says we need to give them all the freedom in the world, wealth will trickle down and everything will be all right. What Winnie pointed out very well in Davos is that most real wealth is actually created at the bottom, by the working and middle classes and at the top there is a huge amount of wealth destruction and exploitation. Entrepreneurs might use the language of entrepreneurialism and hard work, but if you really delve into their business models, you’ll find that they’re not contributing to the common good. They are destroying more than they create. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking.

Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u0026nbspEurope, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.A: How did the billionaires pull this off? How is it that they conquered the realm of ideas so successfully and what do you think we need to do to win the battle of ideas in the coming years?W: I was a student in the UK when Margaret Thatcher set out to crush the unions. There was a new language at that time: the message was that if you are poor you are not working hard enough. You had to be a winner and if you were not, it was your fault. Ordinary working people were put on the defensive. But there are hardly any people now who see themselves reaching the top. The top involves a tiny number of such very rich people it’s unreal. So ordinary people are saying: “Wait a moment, we are in the majority, down here, and our lives are not like that.”R: There is a depressing finding by researchers at the LSE: in a survey of 23 western countries since the 1980s, it was discovered that, as they became more unequal, their populations actually believed more strongly that people at the top were there because they worked the hardest.A: I think in many ways the forces of plutocracy and of conservatism have been better than progressives at understanding the importance of cultivating ideas. And a big part of ideas is language. I want to give some examples of the conquest of language – words that everybody uses, not just plutocrats, but that end up doing the plutocrats’ bidding. One is “win-win”. That phrase sounds great. Who could be against win-win? But, in fact, win-win is a darkly powerful way of suggesting that the only kind of progress worth having is the kind that lets the winners win – in tandem, supposedly, with empowering others.W: Yes, we were told that globalisation was a win-win. It’s a situation where everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. In America no one even wants to say they are working class. They want to be called middle class. People feel that the right thing is to identify with the winners and that has masked many problems.A: A couple more examples. Take “thought leader”. When you were both in Davos, you were surrounded by thought leaders, who are actually people who don’t say what they truly think: they are the ones who say nice things about the powerful and keep getting invited back. Why you two made such a splash is that you refused to be thought leaders, you behaved like thinkers, which is something those people don’t expect. Another instance is “doing well by doing good”: it sounds positive but it really is about putting the people who are trying to make money in charge of changing a status quo they have no interest in changing. And then there are terms such as “social impact” and “social venture capital” and “impact investing”. They are ways of encouraging us not to use words like “power” and “justice” and “dignity”. They are an attempt to make us not speak about unions and taxes.W: I have been attending climate change negotiations since 2007 or 2008, and am always frustrated that you can not use the term “climate justice”. You can talk about “climate change”, but you cannot say it is an injustice, even though the people who are facing the worst consequences are poor people. And they are not the ones who caused it. The negotiators prefer “climate action”, and the idea that we all have to do it together, that kind of happy happy language. We don’t place the responsibility where it lies.R: I really like your point about the importance of ideas, especially on the right. People often focus on Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but what we often forget is that this thing called neoliberalism actually started in the 1950s. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek gathered as part of the influential think tank the Mont Pelerin Society and, back then, these were the real radicals almost everyone else was a socialist or a social democrat. So they said to themselves we have to start developing ideas. We are the resistance now, we need to start building institutions, develop a new narrative, and wait for a moment when the current system crashes – or at least doesn’t work as well any more. This is exactly what happened during the 1970s with the oil crisis, with inflation, with strikes by workers in the west. More and more people began to think that the economic system wasn’t working. And that’s when Thatcher and Reagan came on stage with these supposedly new ideas that had in fact been developed over 30 years. When, after the financial crash of 2008, it became obvious that neoliberalism was founded on a huge amount of bullshit, the problem was that there seemed to be no alternative. The left was against a lot of things: austerity homophobia racism the establishment. But you also need to know what you are for. A few years ago I argued that we needed to have a Mont Pelerin of progressives, to start developing ideas that might seem utterly utopian now but could become a reality in the future. I didn’t expect back then to be invited to Davos, of all places, to talk about basic income, nor that I would go viral with a speech about taxes, taxes, taxes. It has been really interesting how quickly things have changed.Again, in relation to the past, there is the importance of the cold war, capitalism v communism. I’ve often thought social democrats in a way depended on there being communism further to the left. Then, with the defeat of that communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the “end of history” was proclaimed, and politics was just going to become technocracy – win-win. What has been happening now is that there is a new generation that’s not traumatised by the cold war. I’ve heard this in Davos as well: you talk about taxes and some of the billionaires say, “Oh that sounds like Venezuela” – Michael Bloomberg recently said it. But now there is a new generation that says: “Whatever.”A: I’ve met more people on my book tour in the last five months than I’ve ever met before in my life. And the big thing I’ve found is that the conversation no longer revolves around capitalism v gulags. When Bill Gates was asked in Davos about my book, he seemed to insinuate that I was a communist, even though he had blurbed it a year before. I think most people now understand that this “There is no alternative” talk is bullshit. An understanding seems to be rising that it’s not about left v right or communism v capitalism any more, but about humanism v plutocracy.R: One thing I’ve been doing is to use a different kind of language, one that centres on basic income for everyone and higher taxes on the rich. Often people on the left use the language of care, or they say something is just immoral or this is unjust. And yes, there is a certain part of the population that is receptive to this kind of language. But there is another part of the population that doesn’t really like that language. Also, impoverished people never like being talked down to.One thing to do is to take back the win-win language and use it for something else. For example, doing something about poverty – there’s a lot of research that shows eradicating poverty is an investment that pays for itself. You spend less on healthcare costs, you spend less on crime, kids will do better in school, so that is a win-win policy. Also, history shows the most fundamental innovation has come about through government spending. The iPhone is a perfect example: every fundamental technology that has gone through the iPhone touchscreen, the battery, the mobile technology – it has all been invented by researchers on the government payroll. In the 1980s and 90s it became fashionable to think of the government as inherently wasteful. But new research has been conducted by two Dutch economists, who asked 27,000 people in 37 countries: do you think your job is actually valuable? It turns out a quarter think their job doesn’t add anything of value. And four times as many people think that in the private sector as in the public sector. The more valuable jobs, such as caring for other people, police officers, fire fighters, you name it, are in the public sector. It’s possible to take the whole narrative of wasteful jobs and turn it around.W: Yes, at Oxfam we call it a human economy, and we try to paint a picture of what that could look like. We begin with what is wrong now, showing that the super-rich don’t just spend on priceless works of art, but also use that money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice, buy the policy process, to bribe congressmen and women. I call it bribing, they call it lobbying. We show wealth at the top is being used to take away your voice, your rights, the policies that would work for you. I find that this shocks people – they start by thinking that the rich are just enjoying their money, snorting cocaine. Then they actually realise they are using that money to disempower ordinary people. For example, we can express the amount of money governments lose from billionaires’ tax dodging in terms of the number of nurses. Supposing we said: “x-billionaire dodged some 50,000 nurses”. We use that kind of language – it’s emotive, it has an impact on people.A: In the US the right has been better at using the kind of emotive language you describe. For example, the estate tax, which in any version of it only affects a very small number of estates at the top: it was brilliantly rebranded as the death tax. If you call it a death tax you create the feeling among people that their very mortality is being interfered with by the government. People who want more equality and more justice need to get more imaginative with language.R: Here’s an idea: I think we should call it a laziness tax. That’s basically what it is. You have a huge class of people who haven’t actually done any real work themselves or contributed in any meaningful way to societies. They were just born into certain families. I’ve also been trying to reframe basic income as pro-work. It’s “venture capitalism for the people”, to use a Silicon Valley phrase. Everyone wants the ability to make different choices, to move to a different city, start a new company. I dislike the left v right axis, but you often can’t get around it.A: I was listening to an extraordinary conversation Ocasio-Cortez had with the American writer Ta‑Nehisi Coates in a church a couple of weeks ago for Martin Luther King Day. Ocasio-Cortez made the point that elected officials like her are really followers rather than leaders. She said: “Part of the job of elected public office is translating public will into the law of the land. Who shapes, who directs and who moves that public will? Writers, journalists, activists, artists.” And that is so true. It was the job of Upton Sinclair to show what the slaughterhouses were actually like, and what labouring conditions were actually like, and then politicians made laws to improve things. It has been such a grim time for journalism, for books and many of these other things, in part, because of plutocrats and the monopolistic world they have built. But I come to this conversation so optimistic about the power of ideas and books right now. I feel like what we are witnessing is a profound cultural turning point in relation to these issues, caused by activists, artists and writers who are changing what the public wants by telling honest stories.W: Stories are my biggest weapon. Oxfam works in more than 90 countries around the world, and people respond to stories very strongly.R: I’m 30 years old. I’ve been writing for seven or eight years now. And never before have I had such a strong feeling that the zeitgeist is really shifting and now you can talk about things that were simply not possible just a couple of years ago. It seems like the window of what is politically possible is just opening up, or that what they call the Overton window is shifting. Ideas, according to theory that originated with political scientist Joseph Overton, are seen as somehow acceptable to discuss at a certain creative time, and the real political challenge is to move the window. The people behind such a shift are never politicians or mainstream writers, they are the radicals – those who are often seen as naive or bizarre, people who make you uncomfortable and angry. And they often pay a high price for doing this hard work. There are many examples throughout history, whether we are talking about the fight against slavery, or women fighting for the right to vote, or the establishment of the welfare state. Ideas that were first dismissed as ridiculous or too expensive or dangerous became the bedrock of civilisation. W: I hope that’s true.R: I think that hope is exactly the right word, because I never really like the word optimism. Optimism gives you the feeling that, “Oh everything will be all right, just sit down, enjoy the ride – all the trains are good.” But hope is fundamentally different, another world is possible but not inevitable.W: Do you think the racists, the misogynists, feel that they are being pushed back or do they feel they can assert themselves and make their reality the norm?A: My view from the US, and I bet it’s true in Britain to a certain extent, is that you have two big things happening to a lot of white working-class communities. On the one hand, they have been victims of a great plutocratic theft, like everybody else over the last generation. To the extent that they feel like they can’t raise children who will have a better life than them, they can’t get the kind of education that gives them a piece of the dream, they can’t have the kind of healthcare that allows them to not think about healthcare all the time, they feel that theft.The problem is that those people also feel a second theft, which is not actually a theft, which is the rise of women and minorities, and immigrants and African Americans. In fact that’s not a theft at all, it’s a wave of rising equality it is justice. But I think we have to accept that the psychological experience of this change may also be felt as a theft. What Donald Trump did is to exploit the pain caused by the real theft, and to ert blame for it on to the non-theft. He made it all about the cultural ascendancy of others – they are the ones who stole the dream from you.And instead of encouraging people to punch up at the powerful, he encouraged them to punch out, at women and minorities and the Other. I think the political challenge for us is to go to those communities and not to pander but to speak compellingly to both of those experiences of feeling wary of the future, and to identify the real reasons why it has happened. Now, before we go, I want to see if the three of us can make a case for hope. All three of us have been pushing a certain rock up a hill, and suddenly the slope seems to be becoming more hospitable. What do you want to see happen?R: If you ask people from around the globe in what kind of country they would like to live, almost everyone says: “Somewhere like Sweden.” Much less inequality, more rights for workers, higher taxes on the rich, it doesn’t really matter whether you are asking people on the left or right, it’s pretty much the same everywhere. So there is huge potential. You only need to find a way to draw on that political energy. There was one political advertisement by Bernie Sanders, in 2016, that I really like, called Together. In it he says: “We should not allow them to define us.” The whole purpose of the campaign was to bring people together – black, white, men, women, that doesn’t matter. I think this is the very simple message that we need to keep on communicating: don’t allow them to ide us.W: We must go out and mobilise and create new norms, and say, for instance, that it’s wrong for people not to have help when they are sick, they should have free healthcare. That idea was alive after the second world war. Everyone all over the world understood and agreed that healthcare should be a right. What I’m hopeful about is there is such anger at the few who are running away with wealth and power, these monopolies, these big tech companies taking our information, not paying their taxes. So much concentration of wealth and injustice by those few at the top. That is going to help us to shift the norm back to what is good for society, a human economy that works for all, a society that cares for all, including those who may not be able to work and earn. We are now a movement building. • Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas is published by Allen Lane.

In a similar fashion to China and the US, UK policymakers are tacking to a more accommodating stance, communicating additional patience on the delivery of future interest rate hikes.Of course, Brexit remains the elephant in the room and, should an orderly outcome transpire, we would expect the Bank to flip back to a marginally more hawkish bias – perhaps delivering as many as two interest rate hikes before year end.”Not for the faint-hearted....John McDonnell MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, says it shows the risk of leaving the EU without a deal:“The Bank of England downgrading it’s 2019 growth forecast shows that people are increasingly worried about this Government’s stewardship of the economy.“The Government must be stronger in averting a no-deal Brexit, and act now to protect the economy.”Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, fears the economy is already “seizing up” from uncertainty:The Bank’s forecasts, when put together with recent business surveys, illustrate the harmful impact on the economy the longer that this goes on.Brexit uncertainty has kept interest rates on hold this month, and the near-term outlook for the UK economy is also weaker. However, in the event of a smooth Brexit, the Bank expect a lift to economic growth and business investment further ahead, as greater clarity unlocks pent-up demand.” James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, has warned that such weak growth would hurt living standards across the UK.“The Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country.“Today’s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag. Everyone should be focused on the action that sits within the hands of UK policy makers to deliver stronger growth than the frankly awful forecasts published today by the Bank.The broad message from Mark Carney today is that growth has weakened since the last Inflation Report three months ago, Brexit fog is clouding the economy, and the risk of a no-deal Brexit has intensified.Most of the damage will be done in the first half of 2019. If Britain secures a soft Brexit, growth could then pick up - perhaps faster than the Bank expects.The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in the economic data, and more fundamentally, it is creating a series of tensions in the economy, tensions for business.” On the upside, the economy still looks to be in OK shape:The fundamentals of the UK economy are sound. The financial sector is resilient. Corporate balance sheets are strong, and the labour market is tight.”But the downside is that leaving the EU without a deal would hurt the economy - and Mark Carney believes it’s more likely than before. He warned that a No-Deal would raise the chances of “negative quarters” of growth. Two or more negative quarters would be a recession.He also warned that half of UK firms simply aren’t ready for a no-deal Brexit, saying:“Although many companies are stepping up their contingency planning, the economy as a whole is still not yet prepared for a no-deal, no transition exit.In terms of our agent surveys, most recent surveys, of businesses and their preparedness, half of them say they are not ready. And the half that say they are ready... ready means ‘we’ve done all we can’. Carney also criticised European Council chief Donald Tusk, over his claim that a “special place in hell” awaits the leaders of the Brexit campaign. Carney said he was “surprised” by the comments (which have created quite a biblical storm in the UK), and quoted from the Gospel of Matthew:If one wants to be theological, “Do not judge because you too will be judged.”And asked whether he woke up every morning, regretting extending his tenure as BoE governor to help with Brexit, Carney ruefully revealed that the crisis has been interfering with his beauty sleep:“I don’t wake up in the morning any more....I wake up in the middle of the night. “No, the reason I extended was to remain here during a period that could be slightly more volatile or could involve a slightly more difficult transition ..., so obviously I don’t regret it all.”I think we can all sympathise with Mark Carney’s disrupted sleep....Q: Isn’t there a danger that Brexit uncertainty will persist for longer than you expect, hurting the economy, especially as you think it will take four years to agree a UK-EU trade deal?Some uncertainty will linger around, yes, Mark Carney replies. But it would be “substantially less” if the UK leaves with a withdrawal agreement.That’s the end of the press conference. Reaction to follow.....Q: Have you considered copying the Federal Reserve, and holding press conference more frequently?Carney says the Bank has already been making changes to communicate better with households. And as Brexit is such a big issue, the people responsible with handling Brexit should be the ones front and centre right now.Q: Are you worried about disruption at Barclays, where activity investor Ed Bramson is trying to shake up the bank and get a seat on the board. Carney says its important to maintain responsible banking and safe lending standards, and they won’t be compromised for anyone.Q: When you arrived as governor, you intended to leave by last summer. We’re all absolutely delighted that you stayed on longer, but do you ever wake up in the morning and wish you’d stuck to plan A, asks my colleague Larry Elliott mischievously.Fighting off a fit of the giggles, Carney replies that he doesn’t wake up in the morning any more, he wakes up in the middle of the night.But obviously he doesn’t regret agreeing to extend his stint at the BoE, and it’s a privilege to do the job, he replies sincerely (I think!).The rebalancing of the UK economy has paused, Carney warns. Consumption is providing the bulk of the growth again as business investment takes a Brexit hit.Q: Back to Brexit.. is no-deal more likely, and do you think the departure date could be extended?Yes, Mark Carney replies, the probability of a no-deal Brexit has gone up. There are seven weeks until the Brexit data, and there still are a lot of possibilities.He says some senior cabinet ministers have speculated about delaying Brexit beyond 29 March, and that some parliamentary experts have speculated that there isn’t enough time to get all the legislation through.But Carney adds that Theresa May has been adamant that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba07a288b0ea336fb144bb210ee79844c947324/733_0_3263_1958/master/3263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a130de45f33a9ac70e95b95b63d7a47b","title":"clear him out palestinian tenants struggle to rent in west jerusalem","story":"In this ided city, an Arabic name can severely limit the ability to find a home – and anti-discrimination laws don’t cover private housingThe new housemate seemed perfect. A young professional from Jerusalem, fluent in multiple languages, he gelled well with the other tenants. After a short sublet, he asked to be officially added to the lease so he could apply for a parking permit.The landlord became angry and refused. The would-be-housemate had a distinctly Arabic name and the landlord said he wouldn’t rent to a Palestinian. In a text message to one of the other housemates, a British-Israeli teacher, the landlord wrote that he didn’t want a “non-Jew” renting and ordered them to “clear him out as soon as possible”. When the housemates pushed back, the landlord threatened to come with his brothers, change the locks and throw them out.“I was shocked,” says the teacher, but their Palestinian would-be housemate wasn’t. He declined to speak on the record or file a complaint. “What do you expect?” the teacher recalled him saying. “This is Jerusalem.”Like many Palestinians, he had experienced suspicion and racism before in Jewish-majority west Jerusalem. Facing discrimination is common for Palestinians trying to rent apartments on the well-maintained west side of the city. Sometimes it’s an upfront “No Arabs” directive from the landlord, but more often it is harder to pinpoint not getting a call back once an Arabic name comes up, for example.A few years back, Lustingman was leaving an apartment in west Jerusalem before the lease ended and needed a replacement. Luckily a friend, a Palestinian doctor, was interested. He had a guarantor and all the paperwork ready.“The landlord would not accept him as a tenant,” Lustingman says. “He wouldn’t allow a Palestinian person to move there … He’d rather the house stay empty.”She offered to represent her friend in a legal battle, which he declined. “He just wanted to find a different place to live.”Of these four Palestinian statuses, two – Palestinian citizens of Israel and east Jerusalem residents – feel the impact of Jerusalem’s housing dynamics.Given this labyrinthine question of status, as well as the history and ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, the two populations are often fearful of mingling. Palestinian suicide bombers in the mid-2000s brought everyday life in west Jerusalem to a halt, and since 2015 there have been waves of Palestinian stabbings. Many Israelis describe Jerusalem as the kind of city where the three main communities – Jewish Israelis, Palestinians, and ultra-religious Jews – prefer to live separately. The Israeli public was elated when US president Donald Trump moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May last year, effectively endorsing Israel’s position that Jerusalem is its unided capital. Palestinians, however, also claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.Amid these political battles, unofficial housing discrimination remains an effective way to keep the population ided as Israel’s right-wing government attempts to extend its dominance over Jerusalem.A number of lawyers and human rights groups contacted say they are not aware of any legal cases contesting this kind of housing discrimination.“It is difficult to prove,” Lustingman adds. “That’s part of the problem. Usually people will see the name and they won’t say directly that this is the reason … There is no direct straightforward test to this.”While Israeli law directly forbids race, gender and other discrimination in areas such as employment and public space, there is no direct prohibition in relation to private housing. There is, however, a basic premise under Israeli law which stipulates that a contract must be negotiated in good faith – and Lustingman says a lawyer could argue housing discrimination violates this.Estate agent Eva Aviad says there are some areas of west Jerusalem, such as the mixed neighbourhood of Abu Tor, where Palestinians would not face problems renting, adding that she has never encountered a landlord refusing to let to an Arab client.“Most of the landlords that I work with are liberal, excuse me for being so frank,” she says. “The trouble is in this country – and especially in Jerusalem, where you really feel the conflict – is it is hard to be a liberal.”Muhammad, 28, a Hebrew-speaking Palestinian raised in the Old City in east Jerusalem, requested that the  only use his first name. He says he has lived in west Jerusalem for several years but for the past few months has been hunting for a new apartment – and is finding it difficult. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of the city are entirely off limits, he says, and he doesn’t want to live on a street where he’s the only Arab.But Muhammad needs to keep living in Jerusalem to maintain his residency. And as a young person looking for freedom, he doesn’t want to live in the Old City – “the bubble,” he calls it – where Israeli paramilitary police patrol, social norms are conservative, and where his family and neighbours can constantly monitor and restrict his lifestyle.So, before Muhammad goes to meet a potential housemate or landlord, he looks them up on Facebook to try to get a sense of their politics. He then holds his breath for the moment when “you feel something change with them” and he’s told there are others looking or the room is already taken.“Bottom line – I’m still looking for an apartment.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e808aa0c857d3f0dcafcaa7c14aea547d060f80/0_69_4550_2730/master/4550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c55ea4b8065bef8f7dd87e1f917a02","title":"arts culture services austerity","story":"Since 2010, £400m has been stripped from these ‘non-essential’ services. It is a short-sighted, dehumanising tragedyAs it emerged Grantham Museum will soon look out on to a bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher, I found myself thinking about the last time I stepped foot in there.Growing up in the town in the 1990s, the local museum was a cheap trip out for my primary school class, a sea of sticky fingers smudging the glass. I still remember the smell – a sort of musty air mixed with a whiff of adventure.For a small market town, Grantham has a big history, producing not only Thatcher but (more favourably) Isaac Newton. As a kid, our museum was a small window into another world, where the past was packed into a space each of us could explore.Then in 2011 Lincolnshire county council ) moved to close Grantham Museum as part of a “cost-saving exercise” for heritage services. More than 80 years after it first opened, the museum was deemed a service modern society could not afford. In the end, local people formed a charity specifically to save it. The museum survives today because of them – a group of 20 volunteers giving their time to keep history open.It’s a state of affairs replicated up and down the country, with museums, libraries and arts festivals increasingly hollowed out by cash-strapped councils. The maths is simple: as years of austerity have left local authorities struggling to cover even their legal duties, such as social care and child protection, a growing number of so-called nonessential services such as art and culture are cut. Research by the County Councils Network (CCN) recently found £400m has been removed from culture and arts budgets since 2010, with some councils at risk of becoming “little more than social care providers”, as they reduce non-care services to the bare legal minimum.By 2025, the Local Government Association says an £8bn funding black hole will “swallow up” popular council amenities. That means closed leisure centres, axed cultural facilities, fewer bus services, and unkempt parks and green spaces. Even lollipop men and women are under threat.This is all on top of existing cuts. One in three parks no longer has any staff on site, with park funding reduced by at least £15m in the past two years. Elsewhere, £30m was stripped from council library spending in England in 2017-18, according to the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy. Over that time, 127 libraries closed nationwide, with others only propped up by volunteers.It’s easy to dismiss these sorts of services, but there’s a clear symbolism to an area facing the loss of its green spaces or museum. Just as boarded-up shops eat away at a place’s sense of its own worth, the closure of arts, nature, and cultural programmes entrench a feeling that culture is for “other people”. In an all too familiar story, we find ourselves sleepwalking into a society in which creativity, escapism and fulfilment are increasingly saved for the middle classes or big cities.As with so many of the cuts we’ve seen over the last decade, the short term cost-cutting of cultural services will likely ultimately put a larger strain on the public purse. Cut community programmes and anything from literacy problems to mental illness and isolation shoots up.But more than that, it shows how austerity doesn’t simply reduce the services councils are able to offer, but shrinks the landscape of those who rely on them. Or to put it another way: an ideology based on endless money saving can never understand the value of something. A library is not only a place to store books it’s the place a teenage girl goes to find quiet for her exam revision. An arts programme is not a waste of funds it’s how a young man finds a way to express himself. Local services are worth more than their cost on a spreadsheet.When it comes to the spin of austerity, none have been worse affected than local government: Conservatives in Westminster gutted council spending, knowing that the blame would fall on local authorities. And yet matters of who is to blame for a mess are only useful when determining what needs to be done to clear it up. The answer to that is as unfashionably simple as more money: try as they might, ministers know it is simply not possible to cut this deep and for services not to crumble.The question surrounding it, though, is altogether more complex. Just what is it a modern society expects the state to provide? In the coming years, there needs to be an honest discussion on what role councils are expected to play in their communities, and the level of funding this requires. It would be a small, sad nation that set its expectations so low it decides the highest aim of government is to keep the lights on. There are the services that keep us alive. And then there are those that make life worth living."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5432a911d1ac9d6db2ea7cd263401d0e5e5b0399/0_185_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b78bf3c53edf1636daf93687c907b630","title":"green new deal climate change us politics","story":"Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought to redefine freedom in the face of war. The Green New Deal imagines goals for a colorful democracyOne of the biggest challenges of climate politics is that the solutions seem scarier than the problem. We worry that to truly decarbonize, we’d need an authoritarian government or endless austerity. But a big and bold enough Green New Deal could finally make us truly free.The principles that animated the New Deal are often associated with Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s proposed (but never fully enacted) Economic Bill of Rights. These included rights to employment, medical care, housing, education, and social security. Those goals are tragically unrealized for many Americans, and any just version of the Green New Deal must start there. They’re familiar goals for the left, ones we’ve been fighting over for decades. But we also need to rework another New Deal-era statement of principles – FDR’s Four Freedoms.In the twilight hours of 1941, as New Deal progress stalled in the face of white southern resistance to federal power, and the war against Hitler intensified in Europe, FDR sought to describe freedom in new terms. He was struggling to bolster support for his faltering domestic agenda and anticipated foreign one the Four Freedoms were eventually mythologized and sentimentalized in paintings by none other than Norman Rockwell.We’re not trying to reclaim American patriotism or generate support for a coming world war. But the task of reimagining freedom is critical. In 1941, the Four Freedoms idea was a bridge between the New Deal’s unprecedented federal activism, pressed forward by a huge wave of labor and community militancy, and the wartime mobilization that followed, whose speed and scale now inspire the vision of a Green New Deal.The right has claimed the language of freedom for decades. But their vision of freedom as your right as an inidual to do whatever you want – so long as you can pay for it – is a recipe for disaster in the 21st century, when it’s clearer than ever that all our fates are bound up together. Freedom has to mean something more than the capitalist’s freedom to invest or the consumer’s freedom to buy.Here, we modestly upstage FDR with five freedoms that can orient us to an uncertain future.Freedom from fear: FDR called for freedom from fear of military conflict. We’re still working on his call for disarmament – we could start with the US army, the world’s biggest consumer of oil and a purveyor of fear worldwide. We must transform our built environment to grant us freedom from fear of the physical changes that already locked-in global warming will bring: fire and hurricanes, extreme temperatures, sea level rise and storm surges – and freedom from the fear that those dangers will grow exponentially worse. It also means abolishing the social disasters a volatile planet could exacerbate. We need freedom from food scarcity and water shortages, freedom from racist, colonial, and sexual violence, and freedom from militarized borders. Freedom from fear means guaranteed jobs and homes so that we can survive every storm, every relocation, and every reorganization of industry.Freedom from toil: We can’t escape work altogether, and there’s a lot of work we need to do, immediately and in the long term. But work doesn’t need to rule our lives. The great nineteenth-century English socialist William Morris made a distinction between useful work and useless toil: we need the former but should free ourselves from the latter. We can escape the crushing toll of working long hours for low wages to make something that someone else owns. At present, there’s a lot of work that’s worse than useless it’s toil that’s harmful to the people doing it and to the world in which we live. But even useful work should be distributed more widely so that we can all do less of it – and spend more time enjoying its fruits.Freedom to move: We live on a beautiful planet that belongs to everyone we should all be free to move around it. Freedom to move is particularly crucial for those whose homes are being rendered unlivable by rising temperatures and seas. But we should also be free to travel to enjoy our vibrant world’s wonders. Not as quickly as we do now we can’t all fly everywhere at the drop of a hat, and some of us need to fly less often. But it’s the reckless waste of the affluent that must end, not the ordinary person’s occasional pleasure in discovering a new corner of the world. Free public transit is necessary to get around without relying on emissions-spewing cars and airplanes. The freedom to move also means the freedom to pack up and live in another city, region, or country. To cope with inevitable climate displacements, we need solidarity without fences or walls.Freedom from domination: Liberals say the market gives us freedom to choose. But under capitalism, the market is master, determining what we can do and who we can be. Every year or two, we can mark a ballot paper. Every hour of every day the compulsion of the market stamps its will on every aspect of our lives. The left has long sought to end the arbitrary power of the few over the many. We must continue to pursue freedom not only from toil, but from the despotism of the boss, from a viciously enforced racial order, and from the intimate violence of patriarchy. Now, the outrageous power of the few threatens billions with ruin. Domination also names our helplessness in the face of global capitalism. We need to know it’s possible to change our own fate, to be able to imagine the end of capitalism more easily than the end of the world. But we must also let go of old fantasies of achieving freedom by recklessly dominating nature to serve human ends – those dreams have turned into nightmares. We need to live on this planet with other people and species. With innovation, equality, care, and wisdom, we can all have freedom within the realm of ecological necessity.Freedom to live: There is enough on our Earth for people everywhere to have what they need to live well. Reusing, recycling, and – most important – redistributing our abundance will open new vistas. The freedom to live includes freedom from want: plentiful access to the basics, such as food, drink, shelter, healthcare, dental, education, music, art, and green spaces. People are also entitled to the freedom to want: the freedom to enjoy life, to be creative, to produce and delight in communal luxuries, to soak up the public goods we create for everyone’s pleasure, to love those we love, and to find new people to love too. The freedom to live a good life s the shared wonders of knowledge, leisure, and adventure.Enemies of climate action warn of totalitarian dullness, while the fossil industry commits crimes against humanity to maintain the privileges of a few. The point of a Green New Deal is to build the opposite: a colorful democracy for all, to live through sun and storm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ca4ebb83908a430230d9ca7ed4f3ad80a672b4/0_540_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c4b8320a7cc3d6a0c3b66cece815733","title":"poundland engagement ring is perfect sold 20000","story":"These days, no one can afford a ‘real’ ring, so what’s wrong about opting for a cheap ‘placeholder’?I can remember exactly where I was (a pub) when I first discovered the economics of wedding and engagement rings, I was that astonished: the groom is supposed to spend three times his monthly salary on the item. The reason it should be so expensive is that the ring has many functions a gesture of such great love it should cost more than a boiler a symbol of inidual wealth becoming irrelevant as two destinies are conjoined and a signal to the rest of the world of the scale of the catch you have just landed. But if it seemed ridiculous in the 90s, it seems even more outlandish now. Savings are so last century.Poundland recently came to the rescue with a £1 “placeholder” ring: the idea is that you choose your real ring together, but this is a myth, like “first-time buyer”. No one can afford a “real” ring, or a separate wedding ring, least of all when they have to get married. The 20,000 “bling rings” Poundland sold, in a week, will be the rings everyone says “I do” to.I got married, for the second time, less than a year ago. Without going into too much detail about how expensive getting orced is, we were skint. My Mr wanted to get a £20 wedding ring from Argos I wanted a secondhand ring for 20 times that. I won’t say it was the first time we argued, or even the first time we argued that day, but it was definitely the first time he gave me that “who even are you?” look. It is true that I do not seem like the sort of person who would make a rash decision for display purposes – unless it were, I don’t know, buying a Darth Vader suit for a dog.But I knew two things: the first is that nobody ever knows what to say to you when you’ve just got married, so they tell you you look pretty, then they ask to see your ring. I don’t think this happens to men, but it sure as hell happens to women. If you have to do that 50 times, then you will basically spend the whole of your special day talking about Argos. You’ll probably get on to the subject of its tiny pens and its awesome distribution network more than once. That’s not to say a ring doesn’t bring potential negative externalities, since it’s hard to make conversation about adornments per se. I had a friend who said, “I can never believe how cheap antique jewellery is”, then sent me an elaborate apology. At that point, I genuinely was offended that anyone would think I could be offended by someone calling my ring cheap.Second, that ring, unavoidably, becomes sentimental. When Snoop Dogg’s Beautiful is playing because you didn’t bring your own CD, when the registrar is asking you to check the certificate for errors, and you’re saying, “Yes, that’s fine, except you’ve misspelled ‘Southwark’, which is weird, as you have it embroidered on your tie”, that’s the ring you’re in. You will never replace that ring. You might buy another ring, but that will be your original ring. And if it oxidises and turns your finger a bit green, it is still your ring.This doesn’t mean a Poundland ring is a bad idea it’s brilliant. You just need to put FAQs on the invitation, with “Poundland” under “Where did you get your beautiful ring?”, so you don’t spend the day talking about the incredible value of its Halloween decorations. Also, buy seven. Because they might be cheap, but they probably won’t be built to last, even as long as the average marriage. Sentimental attachments are transferable between items, so long as they are identical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89f5d09ac80dd075408b78fe6db2bed917a773e/0_215_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f767eff422e23cc952fee991caab01d7","title":"coal power station cottam to close after half a century","story":"Closure of Cottam plant in Nottinghamshire likely to lead to more than 150 job cutsOne of the UK’s last seven coal power stations will close this year after half a century of generating electricity, as the polluting fuel continues its rapid decline in the energy mix.EDF Energy said more than 150 jobs were likely to be cut due to the closure of the Cottam plant in north Nottinghamshire on 30 September.The power station was no longer economically viable, the company said. Cottam has been hit by the costs of working to European environmental standards and the failure to secure a contract for payments supply backup power after September.The UK government has pledged to end coal power generation in the UK by 2025 to meet its climate change commitments.Gas and renewables have taken up the slack, as new windfarms have been connected to the grid.Cottam started operating in 1969 and is capable of powering around 3.7m homes, though in recent years it will have been operating well below its maximum capacity.EDF Energy, which bought the 2GW plant in 2000, said Cottam had performed well beyond its original 30-year life due to investment and upgrades. But it said the closure was not a surprise.“There has been an aspiration to move away from coal for a long time now and we have prepared thoroughly for the closure,” said Andy Powell, Cottam’s plant manager.However, unions said they had been led to believe the plant would not be wound down until 2025.Mike MacDonald, Prospect negotiations officer, said: “The premature closure of Cottam power station will be a huge blow to workers and to the economies of Worksop and Retford.”The closure is understood not to be related to the suspension of the government’s backup power scheme, the capacity market, but primarily due to the lack of any contracts in the scheme beyond September.After Cottam, EDF Energy will still have one 2GW coal power station at nearby West Burton. That plant has secured contracts for three of its four units until September 2021, implying it will run for another two years before powering down too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145b9fca05bdc57a7109a6ced031fc836ff7df30/491_818_4717_2830/master/4717.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c77e60f30bdc01f4c21e6ce4ba1c92","title":"green new deal alexandria ocasio cortez plan","story":"Blueprint for a carbon-neutral economy has been embraced by prominent Democrats and evokes FDR’s famous legacyAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is releasing a broad outline of a vision for the Green New Deal, a plan to battle economic and racial injustice while also fighting climate change.The new congresswoman’s blueprint, to be made public today, does not set a date for phasing out fossil fuels. But it does aim to develop a carbon-neutral economy in 10 years, which would require huge strides in reducing the US’s reliance on oil and gas and coal. Specifically, the resolution says it is the duty of the federal government to craft a Green New Deal “to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. That includes getting all power from “clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources”.The document also endorses universal healthcare, a jobs guarantee and free higher education – a huge shift in messaging from nearly a decade ago, when Democrats were advocating for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gases by allotting industry permits for pollution.Sixty members of the House and nine senators are co-sponsoring the resolution, including several presidential candidates, according to a fact sheet provided by congressional aides. However, any legislation would be dead-on-arrival with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House, and would be difficult for Democrats to implement even if they controlled government. In supporting documents staffer acknowledge the investment required would be “massive”.The Massachusetts senator Ed Markey is launching the language of the plan with Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday. Discussions on what shape it would take also involved major environment, justice and labor organizations. Backers hope the six-page resolution will push Democrats vying for the White House in 2020 not just to sign on to the general idea, but to lay out specific legislative goals.Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist from New York who has been in Congress for just over a month, centered her campaign on climate change and a Green New Deal.But the resolution itself focuses on the tenets of a progressive policy platform as much as it does on climate change.It is both a framework for a cleaner-energy future and a plan for a large-scale mobilization that would rival in scale and scope the progressive New Deal policies ushered in under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression.One of its goals is “to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth”.The resolution says significant portions of the American population are suffering from declining life expectancy, exposure to pollution, and lacking access to healthy food, healthcare, housing, transportation and education. It spotlights wage stagnation, lacking socio-economic mobility, income inequality, a racial wealth ide, a gender pay gap and weakened bargaining power for workers.The resolution text comes as Donald Trump frequently questions the science that shows humans burning fossil fuels are causing temperatures to rise and exacerbate extreme weather. He did not mention climate change in his annual address to Congress this week, despite increasing warnings from scientists.Democrats, who hold a majority in the House, are trying to raise awareness of climate change as an impending crisis, with two committees holding hearings this week and a third to follow next week. But Republican lawmakers remain resistant to any legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions.Republicans in dual climate change hearings called by House Democrats yesterday attacked the as-yet unwritten Green New Deal, charging that it would be far too expensive and would worsen poverty. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters say the strategy is designed to do the opposite – to create jobs in a green economy.Meanwhile, Trump’s agencies continue to roll back climate regulations enacted by the Obama administration. US carbon emissions increased last year, according to analysis by the economic firm Rhodium Group.Ocasio-Cortez elevated the Green New Deal when she joined activists at a protest outside the then minority leader Nancy Pelosi’s office last year. The activists are planning to protest at Democratic debates in an effort to ensure the proposal, which was until now largely a liberal rallying cry for action on climate change, is a prominent issue for the 2020 election.Before the text was released, several presidential candidates had already embraced the notion of a Green New Deal, including senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro committed to the plan during his campaign announcement.The Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who is the co-chair of the House progressive caucus and a sponsor of the legislation, said the resolution defined the scale and scope of what must be done to combat global warming.“We really need an urgent and comprehensive approach,” said Jayapal.Such legislation has little chance of becoming law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Trump is president. But Jayapal said Democrats would continue to lay the groundwork for a Green New Deal while pushing more incremental legislation.“This is a moment for us to push a comprehensive view of the challenge before us,” she said, “and therefore to offer the solution that we need to address that challenge.”The world has already warmed about 1C since the industrialization in the 19th century and is barreling toward exceeding a 1.5C increase, which climate scientists say will significantly worsen the risks of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty.Already, the process for drafting the brief documents has outlined the fights ahead, even among progressives who want climate action.A background summary prepared by staffers said the plan “sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren’t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then.”But climate justice advocates who represent the communities seeing the worst of environmental damages and pollution already want to quickly phase out all fossil fuels. Many also oppose nuclear power that uses mined uranium but represents a huge portion of the US’s zero-carbon energy.Angela Adrar, the executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance, a coalition of communities dealing with environmental problems, said her group supported the vision of the Green New Deal, even though members were concerned about what they saw as loopholes to allow some fossil fuels use.“The Green New Deal is in the beginning processes. We recognize that it’s being proposed in a very difficult political climate, so while it makes sense to have Beltway consensus on a resolution that might come out really soon, the details is what is really going to make the Green New Deal,” Adrar said.Backers said that even with those differences of opinion, the language released is a significant accomplishment.May Boeve, the executive director of the environmental group 350.org, said in a press release that the “resolution is a massive step forward on the path to making the Green New Deal a reality”.“For too long, we’ve seen legislative action fail to live up to the scale and scope of the climate crisis,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a617c78c096c4884eb21f067e0860fd40a7521c4/0_374_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66db1d266c5a7e242260e73f5f9d966a","title":"gucci withdraws jumper blackface balaclava","story":"Italian fashion house lambasted over ‘balaclava’ polo neck with large red lipsGucci has withdrawn a polo neck jumper from its shops after social media users said it resembled blackface.The $890 (£689) “balaclava” knit, part of the autumnwinter 2018 collection, covers the bottom half of the face and has a cutout mouth with large red lips.On Wednesday, Twitter and Instagram users posted pictures of the jumper, with several pointing to the fact it was currently Black History Month in the US.One person tweeted: “Balaclava knit top by Gucci.

Or the grim story of the ex-husband she married … twice? Hollywood’s most unfiltered actor spills allTiffany Haddish: comedian, actor and, by some measure, the US’s most enjoyable celebrity, has a helluva story to tell. One that involves a stepfather confessing he tried to kill her a mother with schizophrenia an abusive ex-husband whom she married twice, and, well, that’s barely skimming the surface. But ever since her breakout role in the 2017 hit comedy Girls Trip, she has had different kinds of stories to tell. And, oh boy, is she good at telling them.“So I shouldn’t tell this, but … When I arrived in London, I was staying at Salma Hayek’s house – she’s my friend now,” she says, with a grin that is half self-mocking for the name-drop and half endearingly excited. “And I get there and her house is like a PALACE. And she says: ‘OK, pick a room.’ And I’m, like: ‘First off, the fact that you tell me to pick a room is, like, AMAZING.’ Then she shows me her closet and it is the most amazing thing in the world, Gucci, whatever, EVERYTHING. And I’m, like: ‘I’ll sleep in here!’ Then she shows me her daughter’s old bedroom with pink walls, circle bed, unicorn stuff all around. And I’m, like: ‘I’m sleeping in here! I always wanted to be a princess, and this is a princess room!’”By now, Haddish, 39, is so excited she is banging the sofa she is sitting on with her fists, a seven-year-old overcome in a toy store: “I mean, AMAZING!”Haddish and I are meeting in a hotel in London, ostensibly to discuss her work in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. When the first Lego film came out in 2014, she was a little-known comedian who had spent the past decade hacking her way through small TV appearances (typical IMDb entry: “One episode of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, stripper number three.”) Now, just four years later, she is one of the main characters in the mega-earning franchise, appearing alongside Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell and, as is Haddish’s way, nearly stealing the film from all of them.She is extremely funny as the shape-shifting blocks called Queen Watevra Wa’Nabi (as in, “whatever I wanna be”), and the movie is a joy – but it’s clear pretty quickly that Haddish doesn’t have much interest in discussing it. (Me: “What did you think when you saw what your character looked like?” Her: “Never thought I’d play someone with blue eyes, but hey.”)Haddish got her first break in 2015 on Tyler Perry’s soapy drama, If Loving You Is Easy, followed by a regular gig on the NBC sitcom, The Carmichael Show. When she finally shot to fame at 37 in Girls Trip, the riotous and raunchy film about four female friends, critics rightly compared her clearly star-making performance to that of Zach Galifianakis in The Hangover and Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids. While the three other women were perfectly good, Haddish had so much vibrant charisma, she made the others look pale in comparison.Since then, she has won an Emmy for hosting Saturday Night Live is the star of The Last OG, a US comedy created by Jordan Peele and co-starring Tracy Morgan and this year alone has four movies coming out. But alongside her comedy, Haddish has become almost as well known for her appearances on the US talkshow circuit, where she describes her adventures among the A-listers with a candour you never hear from celebrities.Last summer on Jimmy Kimmel, she described the time she went up to Leonardo DiCaprio at a Beverly Hills party and told him: “So, I want to hit that – but I only want to do it to you as your character out of What’s Eating Gilbert Grape.” (DiCaprio played a mentally disabled teenager in the 1994 film.) DiCaprio – understandably – thought this was a joke and launched into the usual actor spiel about how he had prepared for the role, and what a great experience the film was. “And I was like: ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,’” Haddish says making a bored face. “‘But when am I gonna hit that?’”Has she hit that?“No – he never called me! He don’t want me!” she says collapsing on the sofa with an exaggerated sob. She is groomed like a Hollywood starlet for the day – hair straight, gown formal – but throws herself around like a slapstick comedian. “I better leave him alone before he says I #MeToo-ed him through the press, and I don’t harass him because I know he’s got a girlfriend. But when that relationship goes, I’m popping back up, like: ‘Hi, Leonardo!’”I tell her that it’s so much fun to hear what it’s like on the inside of celebrity from someone who clearly still feels like they’re on the outside.“I definitely, totally, feel like I’m on the outside. I mean, where I came from is definitely on the outside, and that’s what made me who I am,” she says.It would hard to be more on the outside than where Haddish started. She was born and raised in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in South Central Los Angeles, and her Eritrean father left when she was three. When she was eight, her mother was in a car accident so serious it gave her brain damage and probably triggered her schizophrenia. Haddish suddenly had to look after her four half-siblings as well as her mother, who, when she got out of hospital, would regularly beat her and tell her that she hated her because she reminded her of Haddish’s father.When Haddish was 12, her mother got into a vicious fight with a neighbour and accidentally whacked his baby with a plank of wood. The baby was fine, but once social services cottoned on to just how chaotic Haddish’s home life was, they intervened. Haddish was placed in a group home, where she was viciously bullied, then in a foster home where the grandfather would suck on her nipples, telling her it would make her breasts grow faster.At what point did she realise she was being molested?“Not until years later! Yeah,” she says with a shrug that seems more like an expression of closure and self-protection than lack of interest.Eventually, Haddish’s grandmother got custody of the kids, and Haddish went to school, where she managed to hide the fact that she was illiterate until she was 14. A few years later, Haddish’s stepfather told her that he had cut the brakes in Haddish’s mother’s car when she’d had her car accident, in the hope of killing her and all the children.“I’m supposed to be a millionaire and y’all supposed to be gone,” he said, according to her extraordinary memoir, The Last Black Unicorn.Is she in touch with her stepfather now?“Yeah, yeah, I just saw him this weekend in Vegas. He came to my show,” she says.How does it feel to see a man who confessed to trying to kill her?“Well, at least he confessed,” she says. But when she sees the expression on my face, she continues: “And, you know, I can’t PROVE he did it. Maybe he was just saying it.”“Maybe to make me work harder or to appreciate life or … or … I don’t know. But I don’t hate him. You know, he fought in the Vietnam war, he was a sniper – he’s got his own little demons. God makes you pay for your sins, and if I hadn’t gone through that, where would I be now?”When Haddish was 15 and back with her grandmother, she became so disruptive in school that her social worker gave her an ultimatum: psychiatric therapy or comedy camp. Haddish chose comedy camp, and, she says simply: “It changed my life.” One of the most heartbreaking parts of reading Haddish’s memoir, I tell her, is thinking of how many other kids – in LA, the US, anywhere – had similarly chaotic beginnings, and knowing she is the exception to getting beyond them. “Totally. I mean, I still live in South Central because it’s where I’m comfortable. But I know I’m blessed,” she says.After finishing high school and getting kicked out by her grandmother, she gave up her tentative dreams of comedy and took various jobs, ranging from working in an airport to being, briefly, a pimp. Eventually, she decided to return to comedy. But she was regularly sexually harassed by comedy club owners – “They’d say: ‘So you want this, you’re gonna have to do that,” – and Haddish always refused. She was so broke that, for a while, she lived in her car. When her comedy colleague Kevin Hart heard, he gave her $300 for a hotel room for a week. Haddish, characteristically and correctly, shot back: “What? I cannot get no hotel room nowhere for 300 bucks.”The two are still good friends, and regularly work together. Haddish is loyal to him when asked about the recent furore around Hart’s homophobic tweets, which led to him stepping down from hosting this year’s Oscars.“First of all, he apologised for what he did years ago,” she begins, which is a somewhat debatable claim. But her second point is undoubtedly true: “So he was like: ‘Oh you guys don’t want it? OK bye.’ And he went to Australia and did a show for 35,000 people, and I think he made more money doing a comedy show than doing the Oscars.”Haddish is always conscious of money. When we meet, she is wearing a beautiful long green Gucci dress (sweetly, she has left the side zip down) and shoes, which she admires lovingly. “It’s nice being able to buy things now, but I still count every penny,” she says.The first thing she did when she started earning was get her mother proper medical care. Haddish’s grandmother and youngest brother live with her while Haddish is redoing her grandmother’s house.So does she support her whole family? “We support each other,” she says firmly. “Maybe I contribute a little more financially because I’m gone a lot now, and that makes me feel bad. But I’m looking forward to having my house back to myself so I can walk around naked. Ha ha!”Haddish is single, and has had, she admits, poor judgment when it comes to men. To make a very long story short, she met her now ex-husband on a cruise, he tracked her down five years later in 2011, and wooed her by finding her father, whom she hadn’t seen since she was three. Pretty much from the beginning, she says, he found him controlling. And yet, despite not even being attracted to him, she married him.“I’m thinking: this is God’s work, and even if he’s not that physically attractive, I can live with that. What’s important is his soul, and to me, it seemed his soul cared about me a lot,” she writes in her memoir.She has also made allegations of physical violence in her autobiography, which he has denied, as well as filing a $1m libel suit against her publisher. She finally orced him – and then, two years later, remarried him. She orced him for a second time in 2013 and is the one subject on which she will not be drawn.“Girl, I don’t deal with that man. I wish him well, and stay out of my life, please,” is all she’ll say when asked about him.She jokes about how she is looking for her fantasy man (“He gotta know how to cook, dance, be psychic …”) But Haddish has generally looked for men who need saving, and, given her family history, it’s not that surprising. Probably the most poignant part of her memoir comes when, as an adult, Haddish tries to involve her biological father in her life. But he abandons her again, and she is devastated.Today, she says she doesn’t really want kids, and initially I assume it’s because of her career ambitions and, yes, she says, it is a bit of that. (“If Meryl Streep can be invited to the Oscars 22 times, why can’t I?”) But she is also scared of repeating her mother’s patterns: “My mama would say to me: ‘You look like your ugly daddy.’ I would hate to hear that come out of my mouth, but who’s to say it wouldn’t? I never want to put that on someone else,” she says. “But if some man inspires me to bust this thing open that’s cool, too!”My favourite Haddish moment is not from her comedy and movies, but when she appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show last year, where, to her astonishment, Oprah Winfrey surprised her on stage.Haddish went in full meltdown, alternately sobbing that she loved her and furiously asking why Winfrey never replied to her letters.“I lost the letter,” Winfrey replied, in a tone that suggests she gets asked that a lot.“But I wrote you six!” wept Haddish on national TV.I tell Haddish I’d never seen a celebrity seem so human on a talkshow, or interview one so open about herself either.“For me, being fake is too exhausting,” she says. “I think the way I grew up, in different homes, different schools, taught me I’m most comfortable being myself wherever I am. Also, I think being fake shows on people – they get tired, or bitter. Being yourself is easiest. I may be cheating but you know what? It feels good!”The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part opens on 8 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

A Japanese snack company is offering chips that require only a single hand to consume – and you don’t have to touch the chips at all. The Tokyo company Koike-ya is behind One Hand Chips, which come pre-smashed so that you can essentially drink them, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now you can swipe with clean hands, and while the calories pile up, you don’t have to waste valuable energy chewing. As one enthusiast tells the paper: “I can just take it and chug it.”Koike-ya is aware of the significance of its accomplishment, calling One Hand Chips “a new snack style humankind has been waiting for”, the Journal reports. But it’s far from the first company to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestyles.Nearly a decade ago, TechCrunch reported on the Potato Chip Hand. It’s a plastic stick with pincers on one end, forming a grabber that pleasingly mimics the white gloves favored by Mickey Mouse and Goofy. It emerged just a few years after release of the first iPhone.McDonald’s, meanwhile, has gradually refined its own tools to address the phone-grease conundrum. In 2017, it unveiled the Frork, which is a device to hold and dip French fries. Wooden chip forks are commonplace in the UK, of course – with the life-changing implication that fries can be a meal – but this was different. The beauty of the Frork was how the fries became a part of it, serving as makeshift tines that you could sweep through ketchup. The trouble was loading the holder with fries, which was essentially impossible without touching them, as the writer Tim Carman observed in a series of Washington Post pieces on fry-centric tech.Perhaps that’s why the brilliant minds at McDonald’s rethought the strategy last year. Instead of targeting the fries, they focused on the phone with the Frylus. Your hands might be covered in grease, but the tool allowed you to use your phone without touching it. Had Apple considered this innovation, perhaps the iPhone would have come with one from the start.According to General Mills, makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you shouldn’t have to “choose between eating and posting” selfies, either. The cereal team invented the selfie spoon a few years back, as reported in Time and promoted in this horrifying music video.It’s a selfie stick with a spoon at one end. They are (or were) free – “Our awesome fans love to share their obsession with our cereal on social media so we wanted to show a little love back,” a marketing planner said on the company’s blog – but you do have to cover shipping. SelfieSpoon trumpets the fact that this is “really a thing”. They are sold out, presumably forever, but one is available for $50 on eBay.One-handed eating is not new. Chopsticks predated the Frork by roughly 4,000 years. There are also a number of longstanding snacks well suited to one-handed eating – I personally recommend granola bars. A word of caution, however: you’re probably better off keeping eating and Instagramming separate. Unsurprisingly, researchers have found that using a phone during a meal leads to less enjoyment. Presumably subjects were not using selfie spoons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d51c9019132b10e4e2adab7e051b6d0e5159b6/1723_669_1844_1107/master/1844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed48c59064da87249ae2d4f5c9582739","title":"jack harper interview real madrid malaga scotland","story":"The Harpers had been on the road for 21 days when the engine failed 1,786 miles from where the journey began and still more than 100 from their destination, so they just set up home there. The family joke about how the Scots came by caravan and by chance: a fireman, a nurse and their children stranded in a vehicle they could not afford to fix, selling it and starting a new life where they had been left: John, Tracey, Ryan, eight, and Emma, seven. And then Jack arrived – a tale that, told with a grin and a little help from Ryan, unfolds like some 20th-century Spanish nativity scene, as if it was all meant to be.“They used to come on holiday and thought it was a good place to bring up the next set of kids,” Jack explains. “They had me on the way when they came and, about six months later, I was born in the centre of Málaga, right next to the cathedral. My mum still talks about it. They didn’t know where the hospitals were, didn’t speak Spanish and had no way of communicating they were expecting a baby, looking for a hospital, asking everyone, but had no idea what anyone said. And it would’ve been a bank holiday too: I was born on Día de Andalucía.”So they searched, increasingly fraught. It was the last day of February 1996, a leap year. “They ended up in a private hospital my dad probably regrets that,” he says. Nearly 23 years on, Harper plays football at La Rosaleda, barely a mile from there. He is, says Marca, a “revelation”, scorer of the goal his coach wants shown at the academy the striker who is leading Málaga, third in the second tier, in their attempted return to La Liga a former Real Madrid forward and not-very-foreign foreigner who is a local hero, an “idol” according to the newspaper whose offices are a goalkick from the ground in the city where he was born.The family no longer have a caravan – “That would be the dream,” Harper says – and they moved to nearby Fuengirola, living on Málaga street. “There’s an Iceland in Málaga. Now and again, when I deserve one, I do like an Irn-Bru,” he smiles, but his diet was mostly Mediterranean, his environment too, and he became as Spanish as British. You can hear it in his accent Scottish in one language, malagueño in the other. “It was school then football – in Spanish – then a switch in my head when I got home.”Like Ryan, who played for nine Spanish clubs before suffering a knee injury, and younger brother Mac, forced out by back problems, Harper could play, leading him to Madrid at 13 and a meeting with Cristiano Ronaldo. A lesson too. “I took a picture. I was tiny, it’s funny looking at that. I’m a fan – he’s the hardest worker, he was always there, I don’t think I’ve ever seen his car move. If it was easy, everyone would do it. He’s obsessed.”Harper does extra shooting and sessions in a hyperbaric chamber – “like a spaceship” – and at Madrid he progressed, seeing the first team more often. “At 17-18, I trained with them a bit. Maybe the manager wants extra men you play the ones who didn’t get on at the weekend, or you play the centre-back, simulating the striker they’ll be up against. We were workers. You go, play, come back, we weren’t told much. But every year I’d get closer.”Every year people would be more aware too. Harper laughs. “I had Twitter and people messaged me every now and again, going: ‘Are you actually Scottish?’ I got my first call-up at 15. We went to Largs.”There he was different. “The only Scottish people I really speak to are my family, I don’t have friends there, so I didn’t have the patter. Even playing, they’d say words I wasn’t sure about. I felt like they’d observe me a bit more, keep their distance, thinking: ‘He doesn’t even speak English,’ or: ‘His attitude won’t be good because he’s from a big club.’ I just wanted to blend in, play for my country. The style was different too.”Perhaps that crystallised at U19 level when the coach, Ricky Sbragia, left Harper out, seeking a more physical, taller team – even though he was already over 6ft. Sbragia said that, while Harper was “exceptionally gifted”, he was a “luxury” who could “float” for Madrid whereas Scotland needed discipline, insisting: “We can’t carry him.” He has since admitted being “at fault”, conceding: “My choice of words was not exactly brilliant.”Amid the fallout, the prospect of Scotland losing Harper to Spain appeared more real. When he is asked what his parents, from Barrhead, would have thought had he ever chosen Spain, his brother Ryan shoots back, laughing: “Adoption!” Harper takes over: “They would have supported me through anything but I’ve always known my dad would have dreamed of one of his kids playing for Scotland. I wasn’t asked and I don’t think you would be you’d just get the call-up and then have a decision to make. But I always thought of playing for Scotland.”Could that dream be close now? “I haven’t had a call, and no one’s asked me for tickets, but I’d like to think they know what I’m doing,” he says. “I think they have to, playing the way I’m playing and the club I’m at.”As scouting trips go, it is a nice one, heading south to the sunshine, but it could have been closer. Harper has been back in Málaga only two years, arriving home via the UK, having been convinced that playing in England would benefit his career, aged 19. He is still convinced even though things did not go as planned. Injury intervened, with internal bleeding on his knee keeping him out for six months and causing him to fail a medical.Instead he moved to Brighton, grateful to have had support through rehabilitation, but limited to just over a dozen games for the U23s. “I didn’t have much time to show what I was worth but it prepared me. Growing up at Madrid, I’d say I have the tiki-taka side, but I still had to man up and England gave me that. It was a learning curve and more than football, it made me a stronger person.”After six years away, a basement room at his parents’ awaited, aged 20. Harper joined Málaga, leading the B team to promotion as the first team suffered relegation, offering opportunity – handed to him by Juan Muñiz. “I’ll never forget this manager,” he says. “The year you break through in professional football, you need trust. In his first talk with me, he said if managers didn’t give chances to youth teamers, there’d never be any footballers. You have to break through somewhere.”Harper broke through. He has started 17 of 24 games with Málaga, who are only a point behind the leaders, Albacete. The pressure is building and he admits that “fun” might not be the word, aware that in football “a lot of people’s emotions are in play, even more this season because I’m from Málaga”, but it’s going well.Just one doubt, then: when he scores, what does he say? “¡Gol!” or “Yes!”? “Erm, tough one … I don’t know. I think my mind doesn’t have a language. But I probably shout “¡Gol!” because that’s what all the fans are shouting.”Gol de Harper, the kid who came in a caravan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c14f2d3737e9b618e4fecb15256969a3303ccfa/953_683_3415_2049/master/3415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5eeef4e11fb962e37dbb470ac0fc9b6","title":"womens aid chief kate ghose steps down public praising ukip","story":"News of her comments sparked outrage from black and ethnic minority groups and others The chief executive of Women’s Aid, Katie Ghose, is stepping down from the domestic abuse charity after complaints from black and minority ethnic women’s refuges about her public praise for Ukip.London Black Women’s Project wrote to Women’s Aid this month calling on the charity to remove Ghose from her post after video footage was circulated on Twitter showing her praising Ukip’s “passion for a new way of doing politics”, referring to Douglas Carswell as “an outstanding MP” and lauding Nigel Farage.Several other groups also expressed anger at Ghose’s comments, made at the Ukip annual conference in September 2015 when she was the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, demanding that Women’s Aid take action because they considered her views on race made her “untenable as a CEO of Women’s Aid”.That same month at a fringe event organised by the society at the party’s conference in Doncaster, the Electoral Reform Society hosted the former Mail Online columnist Katie Hopkins who said she “wouldn’t mind” if the House of Lords was gassed. Ghose does not appear to intervene or challenge Hopkins about her remarks in the video.Amrit Wilson, board member of Imkaan, a Black, South Asian and minority ethnic women’s organisation dedicated to combating violence against women, who shared the videos on Twitter, welcomed Ghose’s departure from Women’s Aid.She said: “I welcome it but Women’s Aid needs to question why this happened and make sure that future appointments are not only carefully vetted but given to people with substantial experience of the women’s sector.”Aaliyah Davis, of the direct action group Sisters Uncut, said she felt that although Ghose was acting in her capacity as the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society at the Ukip conference, her praise for the party had “overstepped the mark”.“We were deeply concerned at the kind of language she was using. It felt like she was trying to garner support from Ukip. I and other members of Sisters Uncut feel she overstepped the mark saying that Ukip had been robbed and rightly there should be more Ukip MPs and it flies in the face of her position at Women’s Aid.”Davis said Ukip’s xenophobia and racism meant that Ghose’s behaviour was “shocking”, considering she would be appointed to lead the UK’s biggest domestic violence charity that has to represent migrant women and BAME women. “She didn’t need to say these things. It’s surprising this didn’t come up in the recruitment process – it feels like feminism has taken a back seat.”In a statement, Women’s Aid said Ghose was leaving “by mutual agreement with the charity’s board. It added: “Katie, as chief executive, has led Women’s Aid through a period of growth in our profile, impact and partnerships. She has achieved a huge amount in her time with us and brought her considerable leadership abilities to achieve influence in Whitehall and Westminster. The trustees thanks her for her commitment, hard work and professionalism and wish her the best for the future.”The charity said it could not comment further for legal reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320612cd436c8ab348b5bb3de43d4add7b2c8b5c/0_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d491a231d996d48af90d96303003e18c","title":"brummies not yam yams and nine other unwritten rules of birmingham","story":"Britain’s ‘second city’ is its own world, with unique customs. Get to know the unspoken lay of the land There’s a whole country outside your window, waiting to be explored. That includes the nation’s second city the crown jewel of jewellery making, and my home: Birmingham.Brummies know that our city can be underestimated (it was once described as “very desolate everywhere” by Queen Victoria), but learn its ways and you too will discover its magic. These 10 unwritten rules will equip even the most insular traveller with the skills to become an honorary Brummie.Remember, Brummies and Yam Yams are differentBrummies are from Birmingham. “Yam Yams” are from Dudley.This fundamental difference is a matter of life of a banishment from the West Midlands. Locals don’t take well to being categorised among those who don’t share their postcode. The DYs and the Bs matter.The accent is supposedly different, but I don’t hear it much. I’d advise you to pretend to acknowledge their differences. Though engaging in a cold war, the Yam Yams and Brummies have shared a unified history from the height of the Industrial Revolution … and a unified aversion to the south. Also, don’t attribute the Industrial Revolution to Manchester. Not if you want to be invited back.When it comes to shopping, no stress allowedNo pushing, no shoving, and no jostling in the shopping areas – that’s not how we do things here. With more than a million residents, the city can feel busy and vibrant, but in our malls – The Mailbox, The Bullring – you won’t find hour-long queues and customers cramped up. It’s all very classy in Birmingham, so much so you can even pause for a snap in front of some art while you shop – that is Laurence Broderick’s iconic bronze bull statue (known as The Bull) outside The Bullring which has been named one of the world’s greatest works of public art.For the best bars, avoid the main dragsKeep away from main roads, otherwise it’s main road prices (who wants to pay £10 for a cocktail?), and what a waste that would be. Birmingham is one of the few cities with an affordable nightlife – the average price of a pint is £2.90 – and some great places to start the night are Suds ‘n’ Duds, a quasi-speakeasy disguised as a launderette, 40 St Pauls, a specialist gin bar, and Jekyll and Hyde, which boasts cocktails inspired by its namesakes’ creativity.Travel by rail to enjoy the best of the city’s nightlifeGetting into Birmingham couldn’t be easier, with London Northwestern Railway running trains to and from London and Liverpool – with stops at major towns and cities including Milton Keynes, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Crewe. The train will drop you at Birmingham New Street, slap-bang in the city centre and the perfect place to start your trip. Don’t battle for parking or against traffic – Birmingham is all about the peace and love – and instead, enjoy a tipple and let the train driver do the work.Do not argue about who birthed rock. It was BirminghamThis is an indisputable fact. You can even walk the road Ozzy Osbourne walked down to get to school. Although, for a music hit that’s a little more creative, visit Nick Drake’s grave in Tanworth-in-Arden or John Bonham’s in Rushock instead.You don’t have to spend a fortune to have a good day outCannon Hill park, Ikon gallery and Birmingham Museum \u0026amp Art Gallery are all must-sees and they’re free to visit, too. There are optional paid extras, such as access to dedicated exhibits, or a ride on the swan boats in Cannon Hill park, but you can have a great day out without breaking the bank.Real Brummies venture outside the cityThere’s plenty to do outside the city centre itself. Spook yourself out at Wychbury obelisk and its accompanying forest, home of the infamous mystery: Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm? You could also check out the Black Country Living Museum, where Peaky Blinders is filmed. And The Red House Glass Cone in Stourbridge is a bittersweet tribute to long-dormant artisanal glass-blowing that the town was famous for in its heyday.Do not miss Soho House (no, not that one)Readers of celebrity magazines might be familiar with London private members’ club, Soho House. But Birmingham’s answer is even better heeled. Soho House is a tranquil Georgian home to refresh your mind and learn something while you’re at it. Along with the standard afternoon tea opportunities that come with stately homes, Soho House hosts talks on the textile industry, women of the Lunar Society and Cafe Scientifique, an informal science debate featuring guest speakers.Watch out on the escalatorsLondoners, are you tired with order confining you to the right-hand side of the escalator? Lucky for you, the West Midlands operates on a free-for-all basis. Want to stand in the middle and have no one attempt to push past you? Want to lean on the left-hand side? Revel in it and stand wherever you want. Want to get past someone? It’s anyone’s game at this point. Godspeed, dear reader.Birmingham has more canals than VeniceSorry, Venice.

And yet all this time a sizeable chunk of genuine, mature Liszt opera has been hiding, as the musicologist David Trippett notes, in plain sight. Early in 1850, Liszt began to set a libretto based on Byron’s Sardanapalus. Two years later, he abandoned it but the first act is there in his notebook, complete enough for Trippett to have reconstructed it with only a little conjecture as to what Liszt might have had in mind. This CD is the result, comprising the first act of Sardanapalo alongside the composer’s symphonic poem Mazeppa.Liszt’s mind, as ever, seems to resemble a vast repository of all the music of the 19th century. The opening music, which sets the scene with favourite concubine Mirra in Assyrian King Sardanapalo’s harem, moves from something like Mendelssohnian fairy music to a worldly little waltz that wouldn’t sound out of place in La Traviata, which Verdi would write three years later. It’s rooted in Italian tradition and yet some of Liszt’s glittering textures seem to look half a century ahead to Richard Strauss. Then, around every corner, there is Wagner Liszt had recently conducted an early performance of Lohengrin, and there’s a Wagnerian slant to the harmony as well as a corresponding grandeur of scope.Could Liszt have become a great operatic composer, too? The music of Sardanapalo is a sometimes heavy-handed melange, but that’s not a charge to which Wagner’s early works are immune. A libretto in which nothing happens in the whole first act is no help. Liszt soon let go of his operatic ambitions and focused on symphonic poems such as Mazeppa, a dynamic performance of which, by the Staatskapelle Weimar, opens this disc. Kirill Karabits conducts this and Sardanapalo with pace and purpose, and his singers are strong if not subtle: Joyce El-Khoury makes an impassioned if sometimes squally Mirra, tenor Airam Hernández is ardent as the king, and Oleksandr Pushniak sings the traditional-spoilsport-bass role of Beleso with all due gravitas.The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s disc of Schubert’s Symphonies Nos 3, 5 and 8. It’s labelled Volume 1, and if conductor Edward Gardner can keep conjuring playing as lithe and light-footed as this, then Volumes 2 and 3 will be well worth looking out for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72bc2b1b54079364edaa5d064d5edd4dcbc89f9/0_165_2819_1691/master/2819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d139f5331e4fcbd2844ef1e832faa6","title":"thank u next why pop stars fell out of love with albums ariana grande","story":"Chart-toppers used to focus on long-players. Now, in the streaming era, they can release tracks whenever they like – and many, including Ariana Grande, have decided to do just thatWhat’s your favourite Ariana Grande single of the past nine months? Was it April’s No Tears Left to Cry, or July’s ballad God Is a Woman? Maybe it was September’s anti-anxiety anthem, Breathin. Perhaps you weren’t a fan of Sweetener, the album that housed all three, and preferred November’s Thank U, Next, a single from a forthcoming album of the same title released this Friday. That global chart-topper was followed a month later by Imagine, which has now been replaced by 7 Rings.Grande’s more-is-more attitude not only demonstrates how rapidly streaming culture has reshaped the way music is released, but, as she outlined in a recent interview with Billboard, how it liberates her from the music industry’s traditionally long-winded release cycle (“Do the teaser before the single, then do the single, and wait to do the preorder, and radio has to impact before the video, and we have to do the discount on this day”). Instead, she releases music direct to her fans, “in the way that a rapper does”.Grande’s rapid-fire release strategy aligns her with a host of emerging pop artists who pepper streaming services with tracks, collaborations, acoustic covers, EPs and so-called “retail mixtapes” (basically an unofficial album) on an almost weekly basis.Australian pop star Betty Who says it is about circumnavigating the music business “middlemen” rather than seeing which songs connect with fans. “I don’t feel like I’m trying to find what sticks. I get to make the music I want to make and I don’t have to get permission from anybody.”Fellow Australian singer-songwriter Emmi has a more complicated relationship with streaming services. In 2016, Taylor Swift included Emmi’s track Sleep on It on her playlist of new music, and more people started paying attention. “Every artist falls prey to the notion that doing anything is better than doing nothing, particularly when there’s a buzz, and your fans are filling up your DMs with: ‘So what’s next?’” she says. “It’s possible you just release because you feel the pressure to keep people happy.” Still, she’s currently releasing a trilogy of playlists. One, out already, follows a relationship from start to finish another is inspired by Shakespeare. “Much like curated playlists on Spotify and Apple, each one has its own mood, style and concept,” she says.Neither Betty Who nor Emmi are on major labels. But for acts that are, such as Anne-Marie and Dua Lipa, this kind of strategy, where a succession of songs are released until one takes off, and then the album follows, can risk boring fans who were in at the start.For Mabel, another major-label pop artist, the trek to her debut album has been a long one. Since her arrival in 2015, she has released 12 singles, an EP and a mixtape, Ivy to Roses. An album is mooted for this year, close to two years after her biggest hit so far, Finders Keepers, a song that took months to build and ended up spending five weeks in the Top 10. Ivy to Roses, originally released in 2017, has recently been expanded to include her new single, Don’t Call Me Up. It has a lot riding on it after her previous single, One Shot, peaked at No 44. In the world of streaming, however, artists can quickly move on from a flop with tracks used to tide fans over before a hit kickstarts an album campaign.So what of pop’s old guard, used to things called “CDs” being sold in places called “record shops”? “Big pop artists need to re-establish themselves in a modern context,” says Chute. “You might spend years planning a new album only to return to a landscape where you have to give half of that music away pre-release, as it boosts your profile.”Olly Murs, who hasn’t added to his tally of eight UK top 10 singles since streaming data was added to the charts in 2014, released a double album last year featuring one side of new songs and one of greatest hits. Recently, Dido rolled out a campaign involving two “promotional singles” ahead of what then turned out to be the proper lead single, a tactic that might have worked had either of the early tracks taken off. Cheryl, meanwhile, is releasing songs on a track-by-track basis, with no threat of an album as yet her comeback, Love Made Me Do It, peaked at No 19.This shift in the mechanisms of pop is embodied by one of its most interesting practitioners, Charli XCX. Having released two traditional albums, in 2017 she put out two album-length mixtapes. Over the next two years, she released six “proper” singles including the Troye Sivan-assisted 1999. When the latter became a hit, she announced that 2019 was the year she would record a new album, tweeting “about time, right??”. Ultimately, the album remains attractive to artists – it can get you Brit and Grammy nominations and a No 1 position, and can allow you to craft a narrative.Perhaps, then, the future is an overlapping of the traditional and the disruptive. “Artists are just putting out what they want, when they want these days, and calling it whatever they need to,” says Emmi. “I think it’s an exciting time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

She said:I’ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday, which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom. The point I made to him was that we should both be working to ensure that we can deliver a closer relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in the future, and that’s what he should be focusing on.As a reminder, this is what Tusk, the president of the European council, said yesterday.By the way, I have been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.Theresa May is now speaking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. She says she has had a good series of meetings. They have been robust, but constructive, she says.She says she explained that there must be changes to the backstop. They will have to be legally binding, she says.She says she and Jean-Claude Juncker have agreed that there will be further talks.Q: Donald Tusk talked about hell yesterday. Aren’t you stuck in some kind of purgatory?May says she spoke to Tusk about what he said. She told him it was not helpful.Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, and Guy Verhofstadt, the parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, have been speaking to journalists after their meeting with Theresa May.Here are the key points.It is important that Mrs May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop, that - what she said already in Belfast - there is no question to remove the backstop. Because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday agreement, safeguarding the internal market and safeguarding also the peace process. For us, an all-weather backstop insurance is absolutely key.It is a disaster on both sides of the Channel and it is, in fact, irresponsible from some politicians in Britain to go for such a no deal and to prefer such a no deal.We cannot have an agreement with uncertainty in the UK based on majorities of six, seven, eight, nine votes in the House of Commons. Cross-party cooperation is the way forward, and I can say that we welcome also the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written today to Mrs May to offer such a cross-party exit. It is important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has recorded a clip for the BBC saying Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to Theresa May setting out five demands for Brexit (see 9.36am) does not rule out a second referendum. Corbyn will be writing to Labour members today confirming this, he says.Starmer is keen to speak out because he has become the most prominent champion in the party of those pushing for a second referendum. What he is saying in this clip, and what he said in a tweet earlier, echoes what he said in his speech to the party conference, after delegates agreed a compromise motion saying: “If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.”But no one ever said the Corbyn letter does rule out a second referendum - because it doesn’t. What is significant about it is that at no point, in a reasonably long letter, does Corbyn even mention a second referendum, even though it did feature in the Labour amendment on Brexit debated last week. When Labour’s Brexit policy was agreed at party conference, some in the party assumed that it meant a failure to trigger a second referendum would automatically lead to the party backing a second referendum as its next move. Corbyn’s letter confirms that that is not the case - because the priority now seems to be getting Theresa May to accept Labour’s proposals. Corbyn does not rule out voting for a second referendum if May rejects his plan, but party sources have been saying explicitly today that that is not the leadership position. (See 11.17am.)Starmer if fighting a rearguard battle to keep the second referendum option in play. But today’s developments make the prospect of Corbyn embracing this idea seem even more extremely improbable than it was, which is why pro-Europeans in the party have been complaining. (See 9.13am.)Theresa May is now meeting Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament.My colleague Daniel Boffey says their handshake looked more cordial than the MayJuncker one.The SNP has criticised Jeremy Corbyn for reaching out to Theresa May over Brexit. In a statement Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, said:Jeremy Corbyn’s confirmation that he will throw support behind Theresa May’s disastrous Brexit deal is a severe blow to businesses, workers and people across the UK who are rightly concerned over the impact of Brexit.The attempt by the Labour leader to mask this as anything other than support for a Tory-driven, economy-wrecking Brexit deal is utterly disingenuous.It is worth pointing out that those Labour MPs who have been pushing for a Norway plus Brexit, or “Common Market 2.0” as it is now being dubbed, have welcomed the Jeremy Corbyn letter. Even though Corbyn is not explicitly backing Norway plus, which would involve staying in the single market and the customs union, his plan - staying in the customs union and “close alignment with the single market” - comes close.This is from Stephen Kinnock.And these are from Lucy Powell, co-author of the recent Common Market 2.0 paper (pdf).Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who also supports a version of Norway plus, has welcomed the Corbyn initiative too.Turning back to the Jeremy Corbyn letter, the Mirror’s Pippa Crerar has an interesting line.And here is some comment from journalists on the joint MayJuncker statement.From the Sun’s Nick GutteridgeFrom the BBC’s Laura KuenssbergFrom the Express’s Joe BarnesFrom the Times’ Sam CoatesFrom the Sun’s Tom Newton DunnAnd the ’s Peter Foster has a whole Twitter thread on this. It starts here.Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, have issued this joint statement after their talks.Prime Minister May and President Juncker have met today to review the next steps in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.The talks were held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU, especially in the context of a shared determination to achieve a strong partnership for the future given the global challenges the EU and the UK face together in upholding open and fair trade, cooperation in the fight against climate change and terrorism and defending the rules-based international system.The prime minister described the context in the UK Parliament, and the motivation behind last week’s vote in the House of Commons seeking a legally binding change to the terms of the backstop. She raised various options for dealing with these concerns in the context of the withdrawal agreement in line with her commitments to the Parliament.President Juncker underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, which represents a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal. President Juncker however expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK. President Juncker drew attention to the fact that any solution would have to be agreed by the European parliament and the EU27.The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.Here are the key lines.Downing Street has given its initial response to the Jeremy Corbyn Brexit letter. (See 9.36am.) A spokesperson said:We will reply in due course. Our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. Our position on the backstop has not changed.Pressed on the arrangements for next week, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, suggested that the debate on Thursday next week would either be on a revised Brexit plan, or else a general Brexit debate on an amendable motion.The government has said repeatedly that it wants a vote on a revised deal as soon as possible and that, if that does not happen by Thursday, there will be a debate anyway on Thursday on Brexit, on amendable motion.Leadsom seemed to be implying that, if Theresa May does get a revised deal next week, the debate and vote on that deal would be on the Thursday.At that point John Bercow, the speaker, intervened to say that, when he saw the draft business for next week last night, it did not include the promised Brexit debate. He said he was alarmed about that, and he said it was very important for the government to honour its promises to MPs about the Brexit vote.Earlier in the Commons Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, accused the government of implementing a “Tory triple-whammy tourist tax”. He made the claim as he asked an urgent question about the HuffPost report saying, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, mobile phone roaming charges could return for people visiting Europe under government plans. Watson said:But Watson said that this assurance was not good enough for consumers. He told MPs:Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced the business for next week. It does include a debate on Brexit on Thursday.She said the government was still committed to having a “meaningful vote” on a revised deal as soon as possible. If this does not happen by Wednesday next week, Theresa May will make a statement to MPs, followed by the debate on Thursday, Leadsom said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcdd37859147d0694e249d8c3017b6df3e309632/0_37_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1a4b507f707b856e2d8faf82fa78719","title":"fit for 2019 one week three writers and a whole lot of wellness","story":"Making positive lifestyle changes is simply a matter of getting into a new, positive habit, right? Three writers log their health and fitness weeks – from swimming to meditation – as they embark on a journey to wellnessIt’s been my ambition to do the splits since I was a teenager. My last attempt, at a Christmas party, didn’t end well. I had to be physically carried off like a sack of potatoes and left in a darkened room with nothing but deep regret and a bag of frozen peas for company.I can’t do that again, so either I have to stop showing off or I’d better get more flexible, and, if we’re being completely honest, the second one is easier. Given the number of women doing the splits up a mountain on Instagram while talking about their #yogajourney, I figure yoga is the place to start. My week begins with some deep ing into YouTube and I discover Yoga with Adriene. She’s funny, a good teacher and – best of all – she doesn’t speak with a wispy, breathy voice.Next, I buy a 30-day unlimited class pass from my local yoga studio. This allows me to try lots of different classes throughout the week, ranging from an absolute beginner’s introductory session and a slow-paced and gentle yin class to a more dynamic vinyasa flow class. Four days in, I even pluck up the courage to try a hot yoga class, where I entirely underestimate how hot and crowded the room will actually be.I tell one of my teachers that I want to be able to do the splits between two moving trucks like Jean-Claude van Damme and she laughs in my face. But I remain undeterred. I’ve even downloaded an app called 1 Second Everyday that nudges me to record a daily video. The app then stitches the footage together so I can see my progress. (It mainly reveals how I’ve pretty much been wearing the same workout gear day in, day out).One week in, I’m not even close to my splits ambition, but that’s OK. It’s nice to get into a routine – even if it’s just 10 minutes of yoga first thing in the morning or last thing at night or, better still, the odd yoga class during my lunch break. Plus, everything they say about yoga boosting your energy is, unfortunately, completely true. I’m sleeping better and crashing less at work. And I think I might be becoming unbearably smug. Guys, hold on tight, I’m on my #yogajourney.Meditation has always been one of those things that I have mentally filed away in a box marked “Sounds Nice But Not For Me”. Yes, I would theoretically love to experience its purported calming and energy-boosting benefits, to briefly hit pause on the frantic whirl of work and social obligations and the corralling of two young kids. But I could never justify it to myself. Gifted with a free hour I will happily head off on a long, mind-unknotting run, play tennis or even, creaky 35-year-old knees be damned, hop on a skateboard. But, just, sitting there? Doing nothing? Ridiculously wasteful.So, it’s fair to say that I approached a week of guided meditation with a degree of apprehension. And my first day – firing up a newly downloaded mindfulness app at the start of an overwhelmingly busy seven days – is only a partial success. I perch on the edge of the bed mid-morning, shut my eyes, follow the soothing instructions and try to focus on my breath. But my mind keeps snagging on all the things I’m meant to be doing andor pondering how much voiceover actors get paid to do a mindfulness app.But then, on day two, something clicks. I open my eyes after a three-minute session (which I’ve now made part of my pre-shower morning routine) and I feel transformed. Rested. Calm. Vaguely atingle and utterly blissed-out. It is as if my mind has been on a micro-spa break. My pile of tasks is still there but, somehow, it doesn’t feel as insurmountable. And it occurs to me that, in contrast to the somewhat stressful logistics that precede a game of tennis or even a run, this is a quick, easy emotional battery charge I can always fit into my day. All that and the prospect of fewer embarrassingly acquired skateboarding injuries. I feel calmer already.There’s something about the prospect of gliding through water that elicits a child-like glee in me, but as I emerge from the changing rooms and glimpse the intense blue of the pool, my excitement is replaced by a creeping anxiety. I haven’t swum in a long time. I’m not a beginner by any means – I reached level 6 in my school days – but despite the pool being quiet, I feel intimidated. After a couple of deep breaths I lower my body into the shallow end of the pool and tread water for 10 minutes, but I can’t quite muster up the confidence to swim. I leave.On my second visit, the pool is busier and just before I get in I see a swimmer doing a beautiful butterfly stroke – I used to able to do that quite effortlessly too. I linger by the changing room doors until the swimmer has gone. Once they leave, and before a new set of people appear, I decide this time I just need to go for it – I haven’t come all this way to just tread water again! I submerge my body into the pool, and propel myself forward with a kick, alternating my arms. My anxiety evaporates, my body acclimatises to the lukewarm water and my muscles relax. I lose my balance slightly, but I persevere. I manage a few, somewhat scrappy but determined strokes to get to the other side of the pool and then come up for air – I haven’t felt this energised for as long as I can remember.Later that week, I return and my confidence grows even more. Swimming in my own lane feels good. But I’m beginning to realise that carving out this time in my week is giving me so much more: space to reflect on the whirlwind few months I’ve had since publishing Slay in Your Lane, and time to reflect on my next move as a writer.

While being told to discuss the possible misuse of images, words and videos online with their children, the recommendations ask adults to curb their own oversharing.“Parents and carers should never assume that children are happy for their photos to be shared,” the recommendations said. “For everyone – when in doubt, don’t upload!”The guidelines come days after a report by the Commons science and technology select committee flagged a lack of high-quality research into the effects of screen time on young people, including studies that explored the impact of particular uses of screens.A commentary by the chief medical officers that accompanies the guidelines also stressed that more research was needed.However, the officers said immediate action to safeguard young people is necessary by the government, social media platforms and technology companies. Among their suggestions are that the latter sign up to a voluntary code of conduct to protect children online, before the possible introduction of new laws.Further recommendations echo those of the committee, including calls for tech companies to share anonymised data to aid research. The officers also said those who sell technology should make sure consumers are aware of child security features and shown how to use them.Andy Burrows, the associate head of child safety online at the NSPCC, agreed urgent action is necessary.“For over a decade, tech giants have failed to protect their young users, and we can’t waste any more time waiting for them to clean up their act,” he said.“We urge the government to legislate without delay, to make social networks accountable and punish them if they fail to keep children safe.”Dr Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said it is impossible at present to break screen time down into “good” and “bad”, since it is highly dependent on content and context.“Idly flicking through a social media site is not the same as doing research for a project or homework – clearly those are very different activities – but at the moment, they have all got lumped together into a general ‘how much time do you spend on the screen’,” he said.The advice for parents and carers includes:• This article was amended on 7 February 2019.

Walker’s cerebral palsy means he has poor coordination and movement, but since last spring Alexa has reminded him to take his medication, as well as automating other tasks around his home.Previously, Walker, who works at Next, used light from his television to get into bed, but can now turn the room lights on and off with his voice. “I haven’t fallen since I’ve had this machine,” he says. “It’s feeling you are in control of your life. My father doesn’t have to worry I am taking my pills at the right time.”An estimated five million UK households have a device that runs either Alexa or Google’s equivalent, according to the research firm Enders Analysis. While most people use chatbots – software that recognises spoken or written natural language and responds in kind – to play music or get answers to questions, there’s increasing interest in people using them to take greater control of their lives. “It could stop a partner becoming a carer,” Walker points out. Walker’s speaker, provided as part of a pilot run by Hampshire county council for 50 recipients of adult social care, does not replace regular visits from care workers to help with physical movement, but means he can do more for himself. Many social care visits are brief calls to check on whether, for instance, someone has taken their pills. If chatbots can replace some of these shorter visits, it could mean care workers being able to spend longer on more useful visits.Graham Allen, Hampshire’s director of adult health and care, says almost three quarters of those in the pilot felt the device helped improve their lives and almost as many felt it had improved their independence, with numbers fairly consistent across different ages. “It’s not a cure-all,” he says. “It needs to be used along with other measures.” But he can see potential for many care service users living at home, and the county’s children’s social services department has just started issuing similar devices.A number of public sector organisations have introduced chatbots, so far mainly to provide information and enable people to report problems. The politan police  is reported to be developing ways for people to report crime via voice-activated systems. School menus in Hampshire are all  online and Amazon’s Alexa can answer questions about them. from parents and children. The Cabinet Office’s government digital service has taken a similar approach with the gov.uk website, so voice-activated speakers can get answers to detailed questions on, for example, the minimum wage for 17-year-olds.Some organisations have gone further. In June 2017, Transport for London launched a text chatbot that uses Facebook Messenger. “It’s useful for people, particularly in their early 20s and 30s, who are more used to the conversational style of messaging platforms,” says Ben Gammon, head of digital services.The TfL chatbot helped more than 29,800 users with travel queries in the last three months of 2018, is available all the time and provides up-to-date, consistent information, says Gammon. “Customers who have simple questions can get an answer while on the go more easily rather than having to search online or call our customer services line.”Aylesbury Vale district council, which runs both text and voice-based chatbot services to deal with a wide range of queries, uses staff to check most queries and, if necessary, edit software-generated responses. The software does provide automatic answers for a handful of the most common queries, but a member of staff still monitors this work and responses are marked as being from an automated system. “ It is important to be transparent,” says Maryvonne Hassall, the council’s digital strategy manager. Last spring, the London borough of Waltham Forest introduced its Walt environmental reporting chatbot, accessible through Messenger and direct messages to a Twitter account @WFTellWalt. It accepts reports on problems such as fly-tipping by asking a short series of questions, with smartphone users able to pass on their locations and pictures of problems. Reports are passed on to the council’s contractors, and people are notified when a problem is solved – something the council says users appreciate. But building chatbot services is expensive for councils, particularly as they are unlikely to be used as much as other channels: three fifths of reports in Waltham Forest come from a standard website form, for instance, with only one fifth arriving through Facebook and Twitter and the rest by phone.Rocco Labellarte, Oxford city council’s chief technology and information officer, says building chatbots is not something councils can do on their own. The city is leading a group of 12 English councils with central government funding to collaborate on developing text and voice chatbots. When Oxford explored voice services, it realised it could afford to build only a couple – a drop in the ocean compared with the hundreds of services most councils provide. If the collaboration’s initial assessment phase justifies further funding, the group hopes to develop text and voice chat services for adoption by more councils. Labellarte led the introduction of the Amelia chatbot service at the London borough of Enfield, which handles queries and requests for permits and authenticates licences. He says that, despite initial set-up costs, chatbots will save councils money by automating the task of answering queries. Labellarte says this could enable people to move to more complex work, where demand is increasing, but there are fears that automation could lead to staff losses and Mariarosaria Taddeo, research fellow at Oxford University’s internet institute and deputy director of its digital ethics lab, believes public services need to exercise care when introducing chatbots. This includes making it clear when bots are in use: “It’s important that users realise there is a machine on the other side,” she says. It also means ensuring automated systems are fair. Many chatbot systems rely on machine learning and there is growing concern about built-in bias. Automated systems can make organisations more efficient – but they must be supervised by real people, says Taddeo.  In Aylesbury Vale, Hassall says chatbots can provide a better service when it comes to factual questions, because they give a consistent response. But she adds that real people should continue to deal with complex queries and anything that requires compassion, such as the result of medical tests. “You need people to engage with people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9711e9640f7a7b206b8c34d2d5c6c8187edb4d6f/0_57_2884_1731/master/2884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de019fb3a92cc21551d32e09dc584d92","title":"ireland england touch of panic six nations","story":"While they may have lost by only 12 points against England, the scoreline did scant justice to the hiding suffered by Ireland in Dublin last weekend. Outfought, out-thought and bullied in their own backyard, they looked a shadow of the rugby juggernaut that had swept all before it for the previous 12 months. A team and their supporters harbouring realistic hopes of winning this year’s World Cup were forced to endure the rudest of awakenings.It was a timely boot up the backside. Ireland’s grand slam clincher at Twickenham last March preceded a series win in Australia that was followed by a rare win against the mighty All Blacks. These results and a subsequent clean sweep of the most prestigious gongs at the World Rugby Awards may have prompted alickadoos in rugby clubs the length and breadth of Ireland to get a little carried away. Following England’s invasion and subsequent occupation of the Aviva Stadium, Ireland’s second place in the world rugby hierarchy no longer looks quite as secure.“I think there is a touch of panic actually,” says Simon Hick from the Second Captains sports podcast, upon being asked to gauge the public mood. “It was such a thorough emptying and we got worse as the game went on. We got caught at the start and it got worse and worse and worse. We’d completely run out of ideas and didn’t look dangerous at all. I think when we play England, especially in Dublin, there’s an assumption we’re going to be up for it and play like wild men and that just didn’t happen.”Joining Hick for the post-mortem, the former Ireland scrum-half Eoin Reddan preached the need for patience. “We should really be giving everyone a bit of space here,” he said. “There’s been a long-term plan in place for a long time.” The  rugby correspondent Gerry Thornley stressed that, while their humbling was a disappointing defeat and performance, “Ireland have not turned into a bad rugby team overnight.”Speaking to the radio station Newstalk, the former Ireland coach Eddie O’Sullivan suggested that “England were on a bit of a mission and they ambushed us” in much the same way Ireland have subjected them to similar shock and awe tactics at Twickenham in the past. “The source of their tries was just putting the ball in behind us – forget about the interception and the other was an error by Keith Earls – so despite everything they’re all fixable,” he said.The responsibility for coming up with solutions lies with Joe Schmidt who names his side to face Scotland later on Thursday for Ireland’s trip to Murrayfield. “We were very quiet before the game,” he said. “I didn’t sense the same energy levels I would have in November when the All Blacks came. I didn’t sense it, I didn’t feel it. You almost sense this sense of vibrancy from the group and we didn’t have it.”The Irish Independent’s Rory O’Connor described Schmidt’s demeanour in the immediate aftermath of the game. “He didn’t take a huge amount of responsibility for anything himself,” he said. “Everything was other people. He was asked would you have done anything differently and he said no. Whether you agree with him or not, he’s very clear in his head about what went wrong.” Facing the press when Ireland reconvened at training, Tadhg Furlong declared there was no need for panic. “Losing games is never nice but it doesn’t mean you throw it all away either and start changing things massively,” said the prop. “If we get back the accuracy that we can bring, we’re confident we can bring a performance as well.”While internet chat forums and message boards are not always the most accurate barometer of informed public opinion, Furlong’s seems to be a view shared by the majority of Irish fans. There has, however, been a clamour for the recall of Simon Zebo following Schmidt’s brief and unsuccessful experiment in switching Robbie Henshaw from centre to full-back, a position where Ireland lack strength in depth. “My phone is always on,” said Zebo, who is currently playing in France and therefore not being considered due to an unwritten rule that says home-based players are preferred.Almost as shocking as the nature of Ireland’s defeat last weekend was the sight of the Aviva Stadium rapidly emptying despite plenty of time being left on the clock. “I was really surprised,” says Hick. “There is always a chance Ireland can come back and 10 minutes is a long time in a rugby game. It was completely flat and there was no sense of hope or excitement in the stadium. An awful lot of people left early.” So many that it was perhaps those fans who stayed until the bitter end that beat the traffic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1fd612a346c8f5e5213cc71520d234615deb878/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15b2dfa1f0bc52ae5de2147b3062bda2","title":"free diving antarctica in pictures sahika ercumen","story":"Şahika Ercümen, a world record-holding free-er from Turkey, is ing in Antarctica as part of a scientific research mission.

The pairing of Danny Dyer and Martin Freeman in The Dumb Waiter (1957) guarantees a pre-sold hit. But it is Jamie Lloyd’s production of a lesser-known radio play, A Slight Ache (1959), with John Heffernan and Gemma Whelan from Game of Thrones, that provides a genuine shock and surprise.The Dumb Waiter is a classic study of two gunmen nervously awaiting instructions in the bleak basement of a Birmingham restaurant. It owes much to Hemingway’s The Killers and anticipates Martin McDonagh’s movie In Bruges. At the same time, it combines the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk with a political study of power and victimisation. Gus, an anxious hitman, asks endless questions while the senior partner, Ben, obeys orders. In Lloyd’s production, even the dumb waiter comes crashing down with the force of a guillotine.But the play is also a joy for actors. Past pairings have included Lee Evans and Jason Isaacs, and Kenneth Cranham and Colin Blakely. The current duo are a match for their predecessors. Freeman avoids the temptation to make the fretful Gus overtly comic: instead he gives us a dapper organisation man, aware that something is not quite right. Dyer, with his looming physique, is the perfect epitome of fake assurance as he rubs his sweaty palms on his thighs. The beauty of this production is that it shows both men are aware that they are part of a hierarchy of terror.If A Slight Ache comes as more of a revelation, it is because of Lloyd’s radical staging. He openly acknowledges this is a radio play and has Heffernan and Whelan initially sitting at microphones as they play a comfortably middle-class couple, Edward and Flora, having a mild spat over the breakfast table. But the action hinges on the intrusion into their lives of an old match-seller who exposes the precariousness not just of their marriage but of their whole existence.On stage, the match-seller is normally a visible presence: sweaty, decrepit and balaclava-helmeted. Lloyd, however, follows the conventions of radio drama and leaves him to our imaginations. As a result, it becomes a play about two people projecting their deepest fears and desires on to a fantasy figure. Heffernan’s Edward moves from a breezily comic attempt to co-opt the unseen match-seller into his own world (“I was in commerce too”) into revelations of panic and insecurity. Whelan is equally remarkable. She adopts a cut-glass accent that gradually yields to a disclosure of her unfulfilled longings: when she urges the match-seller, “Speak to me of love”, it is in the breathily urgent tone of a woman who, you infer, has long been denied the joys of sex.These two plays conclude a season that has itself been full of discoveries. It has reminded us that Pinter, while experimenting with form, had a unified imagination. It has also demolished the myth that one-act plays, like short stories, are an inferior form. In Pinter’s hands they are as richly fulfilling as many an inordinate three-hour epic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a430250ba6c0bcde7ba5c22baf40e72487e007b1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e997d2d2a8435cc547a284f0ff410055","title":"five things every aspiring vegan should have in their kitchen","story":"From flax seeds to coconut oil, these ingredients will make your vegan diet easy and deliciousIt’s a common misconception that being vegan is both tricky and dull. The truth is, there are simple food switches we can make to eat fewer animal products, and with the likes of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s introducing non-dairy versions of some of its most popular flavours, being vegan is now easier than ever.Here are five simple store cupboard updates that will help you be a little more vegan …Flax seedsThe sheer number of things you can use flax seeds for is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.First off, flax eggs. One tablespoon of ground flax seeds mixed with 2-3 tablespoons of warm water becomes a mixture that has the same texture and volume as egg white. You can use these flax eggs in place of chicken’s eggs when binding bakes or adding body to things such as pancakes.Ground flax seeds are also a powerful thickening agent for everything from porridge oats to pasta sauces. Adding a subtle nutty taste and a slightly crunchy texture, they work best with deep flavours such as curries.What makes flax seeds even more essential for vegans is that they contain omega-3, the same kind of good fats you get from oily fish. These oils are essential for optimal brain function, blood flow and can even help reduce the risk of heart disease, so if you’re not getting enough flax seeds in your diet, now’s a great time to start.Keep them whole, boil them with some water and you can even make your own glue or hair gel with them – check out the videos online if you don’t believe us.A word of warning: once ground, flax seeds start to lose their beneficial properties over time, so if you buy them whole, grind them up in a smoothie maker and store them in the fridge. That way, you’ll get the most from these mighty, mini seeds.ChickpeasWhen we say chickpeas, you probably think hummus, and rightly so. Hummus has become a firm favourite in the UK over the past decade, enhancing mealtimes as a condiment and serving up a time-saving savoury snack when combined with veggies or pitta bread.If you have a blender and have never made hummus, you’re missing a trick. It’s a whizz – just blitz a can of chickpeas with a tablespoon or two of tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then add a teaspoon of water at a time until it all turns into that wonderfully familiar, rich, pale, hummusy-textured gloop.Chickpeas aren’t just tasty, though – they’re an excellent source of complex carbs and fibre.And whatever you do with your can of chickpeas, don’t throw away the water. Known as aquafaba, this juice is rich in starch and is a great egg replacement for making meringues or macarons.Pasta sauceWe’re all busy people, and having a staple, cost-effective “meal in minutes” recipe can be the difference between success and failure when embarking on a new diet. What’s handy is that vegan quick fixes can be pretty similar to non-vegan ones, with a piping hot, saucy bowl of pasta being up there with the best of them.Other than puttanesca, which contains anchovies, most jars of tomato-based pasta sauces are free of animal product.Nutritional yeastThe name might make you think of baking and bread, but unlike traditional yeast, nutritional yeast is deactivated, so it doesn’t rise when warmed and wet. It has a distinctly nutty, cheesy taste and looks a lot like fish food flakes.An insider vegan secret for a long time, these tart, deep and earthy-tasting flakes can be sprinkled over pasta as a parmesan replacement, combined with probiotics, ground cashews and agar-agar – a vegan gelatine substitute – to make vegan cheese. They’re also excellent in a crumb coating when whizzed up with some flax seeds.Coconut oilIn a world with no dairy, coconut oil reigns supreme as the most indulgent alternative around. Combined with almond butter and some agave, it’s a sweet, satisfying snack. Melted and ready to get sizzly, it’s the base flavour for the richest stir-fries and curries. And if you’re using cold-pressed coconut oil in baking, it adds a creamy, subtly tropical aroma and taste to everything from brownies to cookies.Melting at around 24C (76F), it tends to stay solid at room temperature in most climates, and in a similar way to cocoa butter, becomes liquid when melted in our hands or mouth.In addition, cold-pressed oil – the pricier variety – can raise levels of good cholesterol. Meanwhile, the cheaper, standard coconut oil carries no coconut flavour, so is an excellent, versatile fat for cooking coconut flavour-free dishes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f68e2b539350cc4d8eb52ab97be8a614ab1f528f/79_31_1828_1096/master/1828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef038d328925e99cbc7567f64d8f4d0f","title":"german regulator orders facebook to restrict data collection","story":"User consent will be required before combining WhatsApp and Instagram account dataGermany’s anti-monopoly regulator has ordered Facebook not to combine user data from its WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook apps without consent, after a major three-year investigation into potentially anti-competitive actions.The federal cartel office announced on Thursday that it would be giving the technology company 12 months to change its data policies.Once the ruling comes into force, Facebook will need “voluntary consent” from users before it can combine data from WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook (known internally as the “blue app” to distinguish it from the wider company).Andreas Mundt, the president of the office, said: “We are carrying out what can be seen as an internal estiture of Facebook’s data. In future, Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts.”The company will also be forced to stop linking data collected from third-party websites, using technologies such as the Facebook tracking pixel, unless users again give voluntary consent.The ruling will strike a blow against Facebook’s intention, revealed just last month, to fully integrate the technology underpinning its three main services so that users can send messages between them. The plan was widely seen as pre-emptive move to make it harder for competition regulators to force the company to spin-off one of its subsidiaries.In a blogpost, Facebook responded to the ruling, saying: “We disagree with their conclusions and intend to appeal.”“Using information across services helps to make them better and protect people’s safety. Facebook has always been about connecting you with people and information you’re interested in. We tailor each person’s Facebook experience so it’s unique to you, and we use a variety of information to do this.”The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a US thinktank that receives substantial funding from the tech industry, warned that the ruling risked muddling antitrust policy and data protection enforcement. “Antitrust enforcement is not the appropriate remedy for data privacy complaints,” said ITIF’s president, Rob Atkinson. “Facebook is not a monopoly in the actual relevant market, the ad market, or even in the social networks market. Rather than an abuse of dominance investigation, this ruling represents a power grab by German authorities that will create confusion throughout the European Union.”Mundt said that Facebook’s data practices contributed to its market power. “As a dominant company, Facebook is subject to special obligations under competition law,” he said. In view of Facebook’s superior market power, an obligatory tick on the box to agree to the company’s terms of use is not an adequate basis for such intensive data processing,” he said.Facebook forced every user worldwide to reissue consent to the company to use their personal data for advertising purposes following the introduction of the GDPR, which tightened the requirement for consent for data processing in the EU .But the social network was criticised by activist groups such as Noyb (“None of your business”) for not allowing users to decline consent without also forcing them to delete their account.“In the end, users only had the choice to delete the account or hit the agree button – that’s not a free choice, it more reminds of a North Korean election process,” said Noyb’s chair, Max Schrems, in May 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b/0_0_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a7f448a8e7af7ce27175bfcbc4c949b","title":"back up bookmarks google","story":"Jenifer wants a backup while EC wants a replacement for Google+, which is shutting downI have a lot of bookmarked sites for medieval manuscripts on my laptop, which it took a long time to collect. How can I back them up in case the laptop dies? JeniferAs you know, Google is closing Google+ in April. I currently use the site as my online bookmarking tool. Can you suggest something that is easy to use both online and on mobile? ECFirst things first, Jenifer. You should have a backup of your whole hard drive in case your laptop dies. Your operating system almost certainly includes usable backup software. Otherwise, there are more than 30 free third-party alternatives for Windows including BackUp Maker, AOMEI Backupper Standard and EaseUS Todo Backup Free.Fortunately, almost all browsers let you save bookmarks into a single file in the web’s HTML format. Double-clicking this file will load it in a tab in your default browser, where you will be able to click the links to your heart’s content. In fact, some people find that having their bookmarks as a local webpage is handier than folders of bookmarks. The drawback? The saved document isn’t updated when you add a new bookmark.In a well-designed browser such as Vivaldi, you can go to the File menu and simply select “Export Bookmarks …” to create a backup file. Opera is almost as good – you select Bookmarks then “Export Bookmarks …” – but most browsers now make it more complicated.In Firefox, for example, you have to use the obscure Library button, or press Ctrl-Shift-B (for Bookmarks), then click the drop-down menu item for “Import and Backup”. In Google Chrome, you can press Ctrl-Shift-O (for Obscure, I assume) to load the bookmark manager or, like me, type chrome:bookmarks in the address bar and hit enter. After that, click the three dots in the blue Bookmarks bar and select “Export bookmarks”.In Microsoft Edge, click the three dots for Settings, or press Alt-X, then the “Import from another browser” button. The export routine has been cunningly hidden behind the import routine.Once you have saved a file called Vivaldi_Bookmarks-20190207.html or something similar, you can stow it somewhere safe. The options include an external hard drive, a USB memory stick, an SD card and so on. You should also load the file – drag and drop usually works – into one or more of your free online storage spaces such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox or whatever you prefer. Once the file is online, you can access it from other PCs, smartphones, tablets and other devices.You can even store your bookmarks in a Microsoft Word document, which will preserve any layout and provide Ctrl-clickable links. I do this by loading the HTML file into a browser, saving it as an MHTML or MHT file, loading that into Word and then saving it as Word file (eg as a doc, docx, rtf file, etc). Internet Explorer can save files in the standard MHTML format. Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Opera can also save MHTML files if you edit the settings (chrome:flags or vivaldi:flags or opera:flags etc). Alternatively, add a browser extension such as SingleFile, which works in both Firefox and Chrome. (MHTML usefully encapsulates whole web pages in a single file, without creating a subdirectory to hold loads of separate js, css and other files.)Browsers generally use folders and subfolders to manage bookmarks. Many of them including Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi and Edge also have synchronisation systems built in to sync bookmarks across different devices, which can be used to restore them onto replacement computers should the worst happen. However, folders can become unwieldy when you have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, which is where bookmark managers come in.Bookmark managers generally allow you to add tags, notes and comments. Tags are useful because you can give each link multiple tags, which is like putting them in multiple folders.Bookmark managers should also provide an extension or bookmarklet so that you can bookmark sites from your browser, without going to the bookmark manager’s website.Google has one of the simplest bookmark managers, which is deservedly obscure, but could suit some users. Apple’s iCloud Bookmarks is rather better, and works in several different browsers – Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE but not Edge – on many different devices.I have not used many bookmark managers or checked for online apps, so you’ll have to try a few to find something you like. The options include start.me, Bookmark Ninja, Dropmark, Raindrop.io, Bookmax, Atavi and, for Chrome only, Booky. Sadly, two of the most popular sites in this category – Delicious and Xmarks – have closed down.There’s also the excellent Pinboard, which now costs $11 a year. Pinboard is run by its founder, Maciej Cegłowski, who bought the remains of Delicious.  Technology used Pinboard for a few years for linkbucket blog posts.Pocket – which is incorporated into Firefox but available for Chrome – would work as a bookmark manager, but is generally used for saving pages to read later. Instapaper does much the same thing.Most researchers who need Zotero will already know about it, though it could well suit someone who likes medieval manuscripts.Otherwise, people who habitually use Microsoft OneNote or Evernote will know they can work really well as bookmark managers, as well as storing web clippings, photos, documents and many other things.Bookmarks graduated from being personal directories to shared resources on sites such as Delicious. This gave rise to social bookmarking and, from 2005-07, a boom in folksonomy or collaborative tagging. In other words, lots of different people adding tags to public links. Delicious was the archetypal example of the genre. Lots of us loved it.Folksonomy was replaced by #hashtagging. This is exactly the same thing, except that hashtags can be applied to anything, not just bookmarks. The main hashtagging sites include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But they are social networking sites, not bookmark managers.I would not have suggested Google+ as a bookmarking site, but perhaps its failure as a social network helped make it viable for that purpose. You could replace it with Bookmax (where free accounts are limited to 1,000 links) or Raindrop.io, but Pinterest might be the best alternative.The basic idea of Pinterest is to create public displays, but you can have any number of “secret boards”. These are private by default, though you can share them with selected people. You could create a separate board for each set of bookmarks to cover news, movies, music etc.Either way, you should download your data from Google+ before it closes on 2 April. The download page lets you select posts from your page and Google+ Communities in HTML format, plus contacts from your Circles. These are in vCard format by default, but you can select CSV, HTML or JSON instead. It doesn’t matter because you only get their name, nickname (if any) and their doomed G+ address. You don’t get their email addresses, phone numbers, job titles or anything else that might be useful.You can have your takeout data sent to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or Box, or download it from an emailed link.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Why did the powerhouse that was black TV drama lose its way? We speak to its trailblazers‘We’re guests here, always on our best behaviour, never at ease. No wonder so many of us go round the twist.” So says Don Warrington in Carbon Copy, a television play first broadcast in 1975. Warrington’s character, Albert, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and is reassessing his place in “the mother country” after a recent awakening of his black identity. Had he been able to see four decades into the future, Albert would doubtless feel even less at ease.Last year’s shaming Windrush scandal, in which British nationals of African-Caribbean heritage were targeted for deportation by the Home Office, demonstrates how some in the UK are still determined to treat black people as “guests”. But Albert might also be depressed at the state of British television 40 years on: how little it built on pioneering dramas like Carbon Copy, and how little is even remembered of them.The title of the British Film Institute’s current season, Forgotten Black TV Drama, is no exaggeration. Most of the titles it gathers together have not been seen by the public since they were first broadcast. Between them they tell a story that is in many ways all too familiar, but in others surprising, perceptive and eerily prescient. In another forgotten drama, 1973’s The Museum Attendant, a black character declares “hating immigrants is the only thing that draws English people together”.It is often assumed that US cinema and television blazed the trail when it came to representation of black people on screen, but British television was ahead of both, argues Stephen Bourne, co-curator of the BFI season. The BBC soap Compact, which began in 1962, had a black magazine photographer, played by Horace James, as a recurring character. ITV hospital drama Emergency – Ward 10 regularly featured a black doctor, played by Joan Hooley, who embarked on a relationship with a white man – including a then-controversial interracial kiss. This was in 1964, four years before Lt Uhura and Captain Kirk kissed in Star Trek. And it wasn’t even the first such kiss on British TV (that was in the Armchair Theatre play Hot Summer Night, in 1959).Interracial relationships figure in the forgotten dramas of the BFI season, but they are by no means the sole preoccupation. The works of Jamaican-born writer Barry Reckord, for instance, are about class isions as much as racial ones. In 1962’s You in Your Small Corner, an educated young black man (played by Reckord’s brother, Lloyd) begins a love affair with a working-class white woman. And in Reckord’s Club Havana, from 1975, Warrington comes from Jamaica to his mother’s Birmingham nightclub and begins an affair with the barmaid, played by a young Julie Walters. His mother dismisses Walters as a “cheap white woman” – not good enough for her son.In Carbon Copy, too, Albert mingles with the white middle classes. His mother is a wealthy first-generation immigrant. “In England, people don’t look down on a person for being black,” she tells him. “They look down on him for being uncultured.”After rediscovering his “blackness”, Albert falls for a British-born black woman, played by Cleo Sylvestre, who is not quite as rapturous about their mystical “African” bond as he is. Nor is she into isive race politics, favouring class solidarity. “We’ve got to separate to keep our identity,” Albert tells her. “No,” she replies, “we’ve got to get together with people who’ve been screwed just like we are.”“Why should we assume that all black people that came to Britain after the second world war were working class?” says Bourne, who has researched and written about black British history and culture for 20 years. “There have been middle-class, affluent black people coming to this country since the year dot. It’s just one of those myths that needs to be addressed.”Reckord came from a well-to-do Jamaican family. He earned a scholarship to Cambridge University in 1950 (brother Lloyd joined him in the UK a year later). Between them the Reckord brothers staged and performed some of the first black British works to be performed – several of which were adapted for television.There was also Guyana-born Jan Carew and his Jamaican wife Sylvia Wynter, who spent a few fruitful years in Britain in the 1950s. Their work seems to have found sympathetic ears – on radio, then on the small screen. In 1961, ITV filmed two of Carew’s plays: The Big Pride (co-written with Wynter) and The Day of the Fox. Both are set in the Caribbean but British immigrants would readily identify with their examinations of postcolonial politics and identity. Somewhat incongruously, The Day of the Fox is led by Sammy Davis Jr - who had just made Ocean’s 11 the year before. The fact that he had to come from Hollywood to British TV to make anything vaguely “political” tells its own story.It is difficult to resist the temptation to describe this as a golden age – even if it was only a few enlightened commissioners allowing the occasional black production through the gates. By the 1980s, though, the quality black drama had somehow dried up. Bourne cites Enoch Powell’s infamous Rivers of Blood speech, in 1968, as a turning point. “After that all the good work we’d done before was erased and forgotten.”Sylvestre agrees. Before her part in Carbon Copy, she became one of the first black soap characters: Melanie in Crossroads, who turns up at the motel and announces she is the adopted daughter of the manager, Meg Richardson.According to Sylvestre, the producer Reg Watson cast her in response to Powell’s speech and the rise in racial tensions around Birmingham, where the show was set. “He wanted to show a young, black character who wasn’t defined by her colour,” says Sylvestre. “It was a very bold move at that time. In fact, I used to get people coming up to me in the street who I’m sure would have agreed with Enoch Powell who’d say, ‘Oh, I love your character.’”For the most part, comedy became the preferred medium for broaching British ersity. Warrington went on to star in one of the better offerings: Rising Damp. His character Philip, who claimed to be an African prince but was actually from Croydon, was often the subject of landlord Rigsby’s animosity. Far less sophisticated was Love Thy Neighbour, which wrung crude, cringeworthy racial humour out of a black couple and a white couple living next door to each other. The white husband routinely referred to his black counterpart (Rudolph Walker) as “nig-nog” or “sambo”.That shift from drama to comedy is clearly visible in the work of writer Trix Worrell, best known as the creator of the hit 1990s sitcom Desmond’s. Originally a theatre director, Worrell made his TV debut in 1984, after he won a scriptwriting competition held by the recently launched Channel 4.His play, Just Like Mohicans – also part of the BFI’s season – was adapted into a 40-minute TV drama. It is virtually a two-hander: an encounter between an elderly Jamaican widow and a hip-hop-savvy black teenager (future EastEnders regular Gary Beadle) who breaks into her house to burgle her. The relationship steadily morphs from victim-criminal to mother-son, and the play becomes an angry clash of generational values.It was heavily autobiographical, acknowledges Worrell, who was born in St Lucia and moved to London as a child in the mid-60s. “Our parents bought into that whole empire, British thing and wanted to better us and better themselves. But we were on the street. We had to suffer the slings and arrows. We were the kids that suffered Sus” – “suspected person” laws, a 1980s precursor to stop and search. “We were walking home from school and being spat at and called all sorts of crap – and that’s just by the police. Shit happened all the time. So you start to go, what the hell are we here for?”The only positive representation Worrell remembers growing up was Carmen Munroe as a nurse on ITV soap General Hospital (he later cast her in Desmond’s). But they still watched Love Thy Neighbour, he says. “We watched it because there we were. We could see ourselves on screen, and that was a thrill in and of itself.” There was also the newsreader Trevor McDonald, Worrell adds. “So it went from the sublime to the ridiculous: Trevor reading the News at 10 and Rudy Walker being called a ‘nig-nog’ in the same evening.”Desmond’s was arguably the first mainstream series to simply accept black Britons as characters in their own right, and it was a huge hit. “I’ve always said you can sell more in comedy than you can in drama,” says Worrell. “You can be more hard-hitting. You can bash them over the head and make them laugh at the same time.”Times have moved on and representation has improved immensely on British television but looking back at the passionate, angry, questioning dramas of the 1960s and 70s, something has been lost. Subsequent generations seem to have had less of a platform to engage with these issues seriously – at least on the small screen.New black British talent is more likely to thrive in the US than at home, looking at the experience of actors such as Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Daniel Kaluuya, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and John Boyega. The continuity has been broken. The contributions of these black dramatists and performers is in danger of being erased, from history and from the archives. It is never too late to start remembering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd563407000cfdee3507d4ba64a9bc106e9e7ee/0_70_1596_958/master/1596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca7ef0b052123300fa799895a6b8874","title":"key west florida sunscreen ban coral reefs","story":"City commission voted 6-1 to bar certain chemicals blamed for harming the only living coral reef found in the continental USOfficials in Key West, the popular Florida holiday destination, have decided to ban the sale of sunscreens containing certain chemicals blamed for harming the only living coral reef found in the continental US.The Key West city commission voted 6-1 on Tuesday to ban the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate within the island city, which is part of the Florida Keys archipelago found off the southern tip of the state.The vote followed a public meeting where marine biologists and conservations decried harmful sunscreens, pointing to research that suggests the chemicals alter corals’ DNA and weaken their immunity to disease. The ban will start in 2021.“We have one reef, and we have to do one small thing to protect that,” said Teri Johnston, mayor of Key West. “It’s our obligation.”Last year, both Hawaii and the Pacific nation of Palau prohibited the sale of certain sunscreens, citing the impact on their own declining coral reefs.Some doctors have opposed banning the sunscreens, arguing the move would increase the risk of skin cancers. Scientists, too, have been ided. In response to a push in Australia to ban sunscreens, the prominent coral reef expert Terry Hughes said: “People make a long list of bad things that human beings do to coral reefs – I would place sunscreen at number 200.”Even if sunscreens are banned, coral reefs around the world face being virtually wiped out on current global warming trends. Corals get stressed and can die in high ocean temperatures, with localized pollution and clumsy tourists also degrading reefs that are vital to a host of marine creatures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd7d01dcf0e15f66f97c89e2494990efc4cc131/0_325_4916_2951/master/4916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf0f95e9c8313ba737993fbf2162382a","title":"new zealands waitangi day 2019 celebrations in pictures","story":"The national holiday celebrates the signing of the treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840 by Māori chiefs and the British Crown that granted the Māori people the rights of British citizens and ownership of their lands and other properties"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3784560.1549484261!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british nuclear waste facility could be located near newry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNuclear waste is stored at about 30 sites across Britain, but predominantly at ground level at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria. Photograph: PAThe Border town of Newry is being considered as a location to dispose of the United Kingdom’s nuclear waste, with research identifying the area as potentially suitable for an underground disposal facility.It is one of five sites in Northern Ireland under consideration as possible stores for the waste and among 45 being examined across the UK as whole.An area of granite bedrock near Newry may be suitable for a geological disposal facility (GDF), according to a recent preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management (RWM), a UK State-owned company.The area of rock stretches from Slieve Gullion to the Mourne mountains. Geological disposal sites hold radioactive waste hundreds of metres underground, and there are no current facilities in Northern Ireland.Future policy decisions on nuclear disposal in Northern Ireland rest with the Stormont executive, where power-sharing has been collapsed for more than two years. The British government’s current preference is that one facility would service the entire UK, a spokesman for RWM has said. Any future facility would need the support of the local community before it could be approved.Nuclear waste is stored at about 30 sites across Britain, but predominantly at ground level at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.Granite“There are granites and similar strong rocks around Newry, in which we may be able to site a GDF,” the recent RWM report said. “We would need to do more work to find out whether these rocks have suitable properties and thicknesses in the depth range of interest for a GDF.” Preliminary reports into other regions of Northern Ireland found a section of strong rock between Omagh and Cookstown, Co Tyrone, which might support a similar facility.A number of areas in the north of the country could also possibly be suitable, researchers found. These included one location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Derry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.On Monday, an emergency motion was passed at the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, unanimously opposing locating any nuclear waste facility in the local area.Some 45 preliminary regional reports had been completed across the UK, assessing what locations might have suitable rock types to build a facility. The reports began a process that could take 10 to 15 years to identify a suitable area, gain the consent of a local community and build the facility, the RWM spokesman said. There was a “false narrative” that nuclear waste disposal facilities would be forced on communities, he said. The waste facility will contain multiple barriers to secure the radioactive material underground for hundreds of thousands of years. The British government has also promised communities hosting future facilities significant investment.Responding to the Newry report, Sinn Féin MP for South Down Chris Hazzard said Britain could not be allowed to use the North “as a dumping ground” for its hazardous and toxic waste. “Not only would this have dire consequences for our environment but it would also pose a serious health risk to the population,” he said.Fine Gael councillor for Dundalk, Co Louth, John McGahon said the initial report was likely nothing more than a “fishing expedition”.He said the probability of any plan being approved was “extremely remote”. It was important politicians on both sides of the Border were not “asleep on the issue,” but equally that local representatives did not engage in “scaremongering,” he said. "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit an idiot s guide to the united kingdom leaving the european union","story":"Brexit basicsBrexit - A combination of the word Britain and exit was coined in 2012 to describe the idea of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. So it should probably have been Ukexit but Brexit trips off the tongue better.Peter Wilding, the managing director of the British Influence think tank, is credited with coining the term Brexit. Wilding was former Conservative party leader David Cameron’s media and policy director of the Conservative Party in the EU from 2005 to 2008.Wilding, who campaigned for the UK to remain within the EU, first used the phrase in 2012 before it was first used publicly by Cameron. Brexit is a first cousin, once removed, of Grexit, which was used to describe Greece’s possible departure from the euro zone during the economic crisis.David who? David Cameron is the former Conservative Party leader and British prime minister. He romped home with a big majority in 2015 riding a wave of a promise he gave to Tory hardliners to hold an inout referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The feeling is\u0026nbspneither he, nor anyone else, really believed the vote would pass. His election victory is now a distant memory. Cameron is rarely seen but is sometimes spotted avoiding members of the media as he jumps into a black Range Rover. Or as Eastenders star Danny Dyer put it, Cameron, who he labelled a “twat”, was in France “with his trotters up” while everybody else was dealing with the Brexit calamity.Theresa May - Ok, so unless you’ve been living under a large rock with no wifi, you’ll know that Theresa May is the Conservative Party leader and current British prime minister. At least as long as nobody else on the planet wants the job. She became British prime minister\u0026nbspin July 2016 in the wake of the Brexit vote and the resignation of Cameron. May who will be 63 in October 2019, was first elected an MP for Maidenhead in 1997 and served as British home secretary (basically, our minister for justice) from 2010 to 2016.Article 50 - This is the “get out clause” of the Treaty of Lisbon. It grants an EU member state the power to quit the bloc unilaterally. Once triggered, it gives the departing country two years to negotiate an exit deal. Theresa May triggered the UK’s exit on March 29th, 2017, scheduling Brexit for 11pm on March 29th, 2019, and starting the countdown clock. A European Court of Justice ruling has said the UK can unilaterally withdraw its article 50 application but extending it, thereby postponing the exit, would require unanimous agreement from the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government.The Withdrawal Agreement - This is the deal reached in November 2018 between May and the European Union on the terms under which Britain would exit the EU. Also known as the “WA”, the “orce deal” and “Theresa May’s deal” it includes a transition period of two years (and possibly longer) after Britain leaves when not much would change. It also contains a provision called the backstop that will kick in to keep the Irish Border open in the event that trading and border arrangements sufficient to achieve this aren’t reached during the transition period.Apart from the backstop, the key issues it covers are the mutual rights of EU and UK citizens now living in each other’s territory and the UK’s financial obligations to the EU (often referred to the the “orce bill”). It is not yet ratified as it is facing strong opposition in the House of Commons. The European Parliament also needs to approve it.The Political Declaration - This is a separate document also agreed in November 2018 between the two sides setting out how they hoped the future relationship will develop in key areas including trade, political and security co-operation and so on. Unlike the withdrawal agreement, this is a political (not a legal) document. So it could be tweaked to try to bring the UK parliament on side.Backstop: The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement, is a kind of insurance policy that will kick in to ensure that there is no hard border in Ireland, no matter what the outcome is of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The agreement involves a transition period, a kind of standstill when most current arrangements would apply until the end of 2020, at least. It can be extended up to the end of 2022. If a trade deal between the EU and UK is not finalised in this time or is not far-reaching enough to ensure that no border checks are needed, then the backstop kicks in. It would involve the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU and the North also sticking to some of the rules and regulations set down in the EU single market. Both sides say they want to avoid using the backstop, or if it is triggered to ensure this only happens for a short period. The term comes from cricket it is a fielding position where the backstop stands behind the wicket-keeper to stop the ball reaching the boundary and prevent the batting team from scoring should the wicket-keeper miss it.Transition period: This is the standstill period which would start immediately the UK leaves on March 29th under the withdrawal agreement. The UK would remain in the EU trading bloc - as a member of the single market and customs union and the rights of business and citizens would remain. The transition period - sometimes referred to by the UK government as the implementation period - would last at least until December 2020. There is scope to extend it until December 2022, at the latest. Brexit supporters don’t like it as it would keep the UK tied to EU laws, but with no say in how these are changed.No-deal Brexit: This means the UK leaving at the end of March- or at some later date if an extension is agreed - without the withdrawal agreement being ratified. This would mean that all the UK’s legal links to the EU would end overnight, new trading rules and regulatory regimes would come into effect immediately. It has led to warnings of economic chaos for the UK and Ireland and more widely in some sectors such as car manufacturing.The EU Single Market - The body of rules, regulations and practices designed to allow free movement of people, capital, goods and services across the EU.The EU Customs Union - The agreement that goods can move freely within the EU with no tariffs, or special import taxes, being applied as they move from one country to another. It also involves common agreed tariff levels on goods coming into the union from outside - meaning that once they enter the EU they too can also circulate freely.Brexit lingo - the everyday phrases\u0026nbspBrexiters - these are simply people in favour of Brexit. Brexiteers are Brexiters, but not necessarily the other way around.Brexiteers - If Brexit and the Three Musketeers had a love child it would be a Brexiteer. The term is used to describe those who are fervently in favour of Brexit to the point, perhaps, where they would carry a sword to make their point. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are Brexiteers, although we are in no way suggesting they would resort to violence to further their cause.Arch Brexiteer- A Brexiteer with a cherry on top, imagine if Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson had a love child with the Incredible Hulk’s angry sister.Remainer - Somebody who voted against the UK leaving the European Union. Can sometimes be heard apologising to the Irish nation on radio and television news programmes or sitting in tears in a hipster cafe in central London reading Fintan O’Toole’s latest  column.Remoaner - A derogatory term used by Brexiters, Brexiteers or Arch Brexiteers to describe a Remainer. Calling someone a remoaner is up there with calling your female work colleague a nag.Red Lines - Issues where compromise is not an option. Everyone from the Democratic Unionist Party to the Dublin Government to the British government to the Conservative party hardliners to the European Union itself have their own favourite red lines. There are so many red lines, it very quickly after June 2016 began to look like a big bowl of spaghetti and red pesto. There is a lot of talk now, in particular, about whether Theresa May will move any of her “red lines” to try the break the logjam and win House of Commons support for her deal.Strong and stable - British prime minister Theresa May called a snap election in April 2017 saying the UK needed a “strong and stable” government because of Brexit. It is an expression she would live to regret after she lost her majority and was forced to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The DUP are among the most vociferously opposed to the withdrawal agreement Theresa May negotiated with the EU and to the backstop. The institutions expected to guarantee strong and stable society in the UK and other democracies are now very weak and unstable.Brino or Bino - “Brexit in name only” is the position the United Kingdom might find itself in if it were to leave the EU on terms dictated to it whereby the country must align itself to such an extent that it would operate in almost the same fashion as if it were inside the EU. So it would have left the European Union but would be still subject to the same trading rules and legal obligations. Bino is the worst case scenario for those who want Brexit.Irexit - A second cousin of both Brexit and Grexit, this describes Ireland’s exit from the European Union, which of course if very unlikely to happen any time in the near future. The most recent Eurobarometer survey shows Irish people to be more than happy with EU membership, notwithstanding our relationship with European authorities during the economic crash.Regrexit: The feeling of regret and guilt for voting in favour of Brexit. The phenomenon was felt as soon as the morning after the vote in June 2016 as it is thought many voted for Brexit as a protest against other issues with the assumption it would not pass. Doh!Nebulous - What Theresa May accused European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker of calling her during a Brussels showdown in December. That’s according to lip-readers. He was calling “the British position” nebulous, he insisted. The whole episode was caught on camera and the entire world collectively wished Mammy and Daddy would stop arguing. Explaining the episode afterwards May said: “I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.Nebulous (2) - Lady Sylia Hermon described the proposals in an amendment supported by Theresa May’s government to come up with an “alternative” to the backstop as nebulous.Hard border - This refers to the situation where border checkpoints by police andor soldiers would be erected to regulate the movement of people and goods between the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be in the EU and Northern Ireland, which will remain in the UK and therefore outside the European Union. The idea strikes fear into the hearts of most people on the island of Ireland and many in Britain given how much a target border infrastructure was for paramilitaries during the Troubles. Not to mention the disruption a hard border would cause to everyday life in border communities. The backstop was set up specifically to avoid the hard border.Soft or frictionless border - This describes how the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland operates now. People can move freely back and forth without even knowing which jurisdiction they are in. Think leaving Forkhill to visit your Aunty Mary in Dundalk without getting stopped by a soldier to ask what’s in the boot of your car. Goods can move freely too, with no hindrance or checks, though there are police operations against smuggling.The buzzwords\u0026nbspSecond referendum - This is a mechanism deployed in Ireland several times, designed to allow people who feel regrexit to have another bite at the cherry. Those who want a second vote say the electorate was led down the garden path the first time around, while those against it say the people have already spoken. If a second referendum were to be held it remains unclear which side would win. Remember that snap UK election Theresa May called in 2017 seeking a strong mandate from the people? They ended up with a lame duck administration propped up by the arch-Brexiteer Democratic Unionist Party. Dealing with the electorate is like trying to herd cats - anything could happen.Unless and until - The phrase used many, many times, to describe how long the provisions of the backstop would stay in place, i.e. unless or until there is an agreement that ensures no hard border in Ireland. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has been saying it at the drop of a hat. For Brexiters, Brexiteers and arch Brexiteers it is the proverbial nails on the Brexit blackboard.Time-limited backstop - A key problem in the UK parliament with the backstop plan is that – after the transition period – it commits the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU until another solution is found to the Irish border issue. For this reason there are demands to put a time-limit on the backstop. However, for Ireland and the EU this goes against the “ unless and until” commitment.Alternative arrangements - The UK argues that there are other ways to control goods flowing across the Irish border, apart from physical infrastructure. And so these are alternatives to the backstop . These include advanced customs processes and the use of specialist technology to monitor the movement of goods. The EU has promised in the draft withdrawal agreement to assess alternatives to the backstop with the UK, but has pointed out that there is no border anywhere between two trading zones where some checks do not take place .Maxfac - Maximum facilitation or “maxfac” is a phrase often used by Brexiteers to describe the idea that technology and customs processes can be used to avoid a hard border with infrastructure.The Malthouse Proposal - a plan which has found support in the Conservative Party late in the day, for the UK to exit the EU and replace the backstop with a free-trade deal with the EU combined with the use of technology to do away with customs checks. It also proposes to extend the standstill transition period until the end of 2021. It sounds like it was dreamt up in a pub but in fact it was brokered by housing minister Kit Malthouse.SoftSofter Brexit - It had been thought that Theresa May, following the rejection of her original deal in the House of Commons, might try to reach agreement on a softer version of Brexit. A softer Brexit would mean the UK remaining more closely aligned to EU rules and regulations and probably also remaining in a customs union with the EU. However there has as yet been no effort to reach this kind of deal with Labour, whose support May would need to get this over the line in the House of Commons.Canada ++ - This is the idea that the UK would end up, after Brexit, in a free trade deal with the EU similar to the one completed with Canada but hopefully involving an even closer relationship (hence, plus, or plus plus). The trading arrangements between the two sides are only due to be negotiated after Brexit takes place. If there is a no-deal Brexit and no agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves, it is not clear what the options will be for future negotiations.Norway - A Scandinavian country’s name but also used to describe the way Norway trades and relates to the European Union. The Norway model might be considered Bino by Brexiters as it would involve staying in the EU single market and subject to its rules (though overseen by a separate court). Norway-plus is sometimes used to refer to a Norway-style deal with additional membership of a customs union with the EU. This would solve the Irish Border problem but would be too close a relationship for the Brexiteers.WTO rules - If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then it will trade with the EU and everyone else – on the basis of rules set down by the World Trade Organisation. This would involve tariffs, or special import taxes, on goods moving in and out of the UK to EU and third country markets. The UK would hope to maintain existing trade links, negotiated by the EU, with many other countries and also to do a future trade deal with the EU. There is debate on whether, immediately after leaving, the UK would immediately invoke WTO rules. It is meant to deal with all countries with which it does not have a trade deal the same, but enforcement of this is via a long drawn-out disputes process.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Hayley from Co Clare told RTÉ’s Liveline she was delighted the message had resonated with so many people. Mr Juncker produced the green-coloured ‘Thank You from Ireland’ card at a press briefing on Wednesday with Taoiseach Leo Varadker. Many observers had assumed that it had come from the Taoiseach, but Mr Juncker said it was sent by an Irish citizen. Hayley said she had “absolutely no agenda” in sending the card and anticipated Mr Juncker would not even see the card let alone respond publicly to it. “I’m literally just one person in Ireland. It is literally me, my husband and my two dogs,” she told Liveline. “Anybody who knows me knows I’m big on thank you cards. If my niece gets an A, she gets a card in the post. I happened to make it giant, only because I am that sort of person.”A picture of the card’s inside reads: “Dear Mr Juncker, I will be honest. I never really understood the importance of the EU.”It continued to say the EU “was something we learned about in school, a part of history, more than a part of today.”The sender went on to praise Mr Juncker, “but your five words, ‘Ireland’s borders are Europe’s borders’ made me want to jump for joy, punch my hands into the air, and kiss you. For the first time ever Ireland is stronger than Britain. That strength comes not from guns or bombs, it comes from your words and that of your colleagues.”She then went on, semi-seriously she claims, to state: “Britain does not care about peace in Northern Ireland. Ireland to them is a nuisance. The UK do (sic) have an alternative. They can keep Northern Ireland in the customs union by handing it back, that which they stole by brute force, to the Republic of Ireland (kind of). “Mr Juncker you broke the internet, Mr Juncker you broke the mike. I am forever in your debt. As we say in Ireland, if you are ever around, we will have the kettle on for you (this means you are invited for a cup of tea). Just give me a heads up if you are coming so I can get the place clean for you.” Ironically, she sourced the card from a British company, Moonpig. com and the card was sent from Britain with a British postmark. Hayley, who declined to give her surname because she said she has faced online abuse, told Joe Duffy her comments about Ireland now being stronger than Britain had gained a lot of traction. “Ireland does need to be proud of the support the EU has given. In my lifetime, it is nice that this little island of Ireland is now mighty. We are strong and we are able to stand up to people to whom we weren’t able to stand up to before.” She also detailed some of the responses to her card online. One read: “Whingery is part of the Catholic mindset. Poland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal - all priest-ridden, all sad nations of sadder underachievers. Protestants, step up, take responsibility, get on with the job and prosper”. Another stated: “I loved the Irish, but sometimes they come across as toddlers. It is not England’s fault that you have never organised yourselves to take your country back and turn it into a powerful place. It is no point claiming the 800 years of hurt and then sticking out your bottom lip like toddlers.” When a spokesman for Mr Juncker was asked if the EC president had received any well wishing cards from Britain, he said: “I have no idea, unfortunately.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.3657023.1539082433!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit the","story":"Countdown to Brexit: The UK voted to leave the European Union on June 23rd\u0026nbsp2016 by a majority of 51.9 to 48.1 per cent, with a turnout of just under 72 per cent. This set the UK on course to leave the EU, but left all the details of its exit still to be decided. The timetable was set the following March 29th, when British prime minister Theresa May took the formal step, required under EU law to start the exit process, of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Under the two-year process the UK will leave the EU on March 29th, 2019. An extension to the exit period is possible\u0026nbspif all 28 EU members agree. However negotiations have been taking place on the assumption that the UK leaves in March 2019.\u0026nbspThe talks between the UK and EU started in June 2017 and so far have focused on the details of the UK’s withdrawal, which must be set down in a formal, legal agreement. Outline agreement has been reached on what the UK will pay the EU after departure – the so-called exit bill or orce bill – and on the mutual recognition of the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.In November, agreement was also reached on a backstop for the Irish border, a way to provide a guarantee that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK.\u0026nbspThis cleared the way for a draft withdrawal agreement and final talks on a political declaration outlining the principles for future negotiations. This draft needs to be ratified politically by both sides.For a country to leave the EU is unprecedented ‑ and the extent of the complications has\u0026nbspslowly become evident\u0026nbspin the last couple of years. EU membership is a central part of the economy and society of all its members and unscrambling this is very complex, before account is even taken of sketching out how the two sides will relate to each other in future.Much of the discussion has been about the UK’s membership of the EU trading bloc. There are two elements to this. First, the UK is part of the EU customs union. This is a free trade area under which allows goods to circulate freely through the EU. Part of this is a commitment by all members to impose the same import tariffs – or taxes – on goods entering from outside the EU.The UK is also part of the EU single market, the system of rules and regulations which allow free movement of goods, services, people and capital. Together, membership of the customs union and single market allows goods to move freely across the EU and also for free trade in services like banking. Common EU regulations also underpin trade in a host of different areas, for example pharmaceuticals and food.The single market also allows free movement of people across the EU. The UK is also involved in common international policies co-ordinated at EU level, notably in foreign policy and defence and in trade deals with other countries.Brexit talks between the UK and the EU are taking place in a sequenced order, which has led to no little confusion in the debate.What has been agreed are the draft terms on which the UK leaves, contained\u0026nbspin the withdrawal agreement. A political declaration on what the future relationship might look like has also been finalised. However, details of the future relationship between the EU and UK will be decided in talks after the UK actually leaves ‑ \u0026nbspassuming the two sides are still talking.In the short term the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement would mean that once the UK leaves in March 2019 a transition period, a kind of standstill, would commence and last until the end of 2020. The draft withdrawal agreement also suggests that this transition period could be extended until 2022. If the agreement is ratified and the transition period kicks in, not much will change on March 29th, except for the UK’s formal departure.If there is no withdrawal agreement, then the UK would leave the EU in a so-called “no-deal” Brexit in March 2019, which could be chaotic as barriers to trade would go up overnight and there would be uncertainties in areas ranging from aviation to pharmaceuticals to co-operation in nuclear regulation. There is speculation that the EU and UK would work together to try to avoid the worst of the chaos – though they could only do so much ‑ \u0026nbspor even that there might be late moves to delay the UK’s exit date.The crunch point is that the EU insists that the UK must either be fully in the EU trading bloc and accept all the rules, or be out of it, and have a relationship similar to the EU and Canada. For the UK, the more closely aligned it remains with the EU, the less freedom it will have to set its own economic course after Brexit.The UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc too so checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.The economic impact of Brexit is negative, for both the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU. The biggest impact will be in the UK itself and in Ireland, its closest trading partner. \u0026nbspFor the UK, any trade arrangement reached after Brexit – barring full membership of the EU trading bloc, which the UK has ruled out – will be less favourable than current arrangements. Economists say that any new trade opportunities elsewhere will not make up for losses in trade with the EU. Weaker sterling since Brexit has already cut the purchasing power of UK consumers and uncertainty has hit investment, with growth estimated to be 1 to 2 per cent per annum lower over the couple of years.For Ireland, growth remains strong and the main short-term impact has been via a weaker sterling exchange rate, which is good if you’re going to the UK to buy a second-hand car but bad if you’re an exporter to the UK market.\u0026nbspThe main threat to Brexit comes from barriers to exports to the UK and also delays and higher prices for importers of UK goods to Ireland. Forecasters have estimated that in a harder version of Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU trading bloc, the Irish economy could be 4 to 7 per cent lower in a decade’s time, with most of the hit in the first five years. A no-deal Brexit means the economic effect would be more severe and happen more quicklyFebruary 13th, 2019:\u0026nbspTheresa May has scheduled a second “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal for this date after the UK parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement brokered with the EU by 432 votes to 202 on January 15th.February 22nd, 2019: Irish Government hopes to publish in full emergency legislation to cope with a no-deal Brexit, the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union) Bill. This is an omnibus piece of legislation with 17 sections covers a range of areas including economic, social, transport, health and justice activities.March 14th, 2019: The Government is targeting the passage of the ‘hard Brexit’ emergency legislation by the Oireachtas by this date.February to March, 2019: If the withdrawal deal is on track, then national and regional parliaments across the EU will vote on it. The European Parliaments has to approve it by a simple majority.11pm, March 29th, 2019: Brexit - the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union. If a deal is reached, the 21-month standstill transition period kicks in, maintaining the existing EU-UK relationship while both sides try to hammer out a future trading agreement.\u0026nbspJuly 1st, 2020: Under the draft Brexit agreement, the UK and EU can, before this date, request an extension to the transition period of up to one or two years to the transition period.\u0026nbspDecember 31st, 2020: If the EU and UK have agreed a Brexit treaty and agree a future trading relationship, this is the earliest date by which the transition period will end.\u0026nbspDecember 31st, 2022: the date the EU’s chief negotiator has proposed extending the Brexit transition to in order to allow the EU and UK negotiate a trading deal. Under the withdrawal agreement this is the latest date on which the transition period can end. If it were extended until 2022 it would mean that the UK would stay within the single market and customs union for six and a half years after the Brexit vote."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3784329.1549494552!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why would eu make assurances given to uk on withdrawal agreement legally binding","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday. Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAWe are in clutching-at-straws mode here, with barely 50 days to go to a “hard” British departure.And so on Monday, when there was a hint that the European Commission was coming up with a new idea – however thin – to break the backstop deadlock, it was pored over by the British press in forensic detail. In truth a storm in a teacup.Had commission secretary general Martin Selmayr, president Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man, really suggested that it might be willing to add to the withdrawal agreement the assurances given to the UK by Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk, to give them legally binding force?Well, not exactly. In fact, not at all, according to Selmayr, after MPs from the Commons cross-party Brexit select committee suggested as much following a long meeting with him.At issue was whether the idea, which was certainly discussed, emanated from Selmayr or from the MPs. If the former, was he really suggesting that the commission, contrary to its repeated insistence, would be prepared to “reopen” the 585-page withdrawal agreement to include what has been described variously as an additional “codicil” or protocol?‘Unzipping’“I would term it unzipping,” he explained somewhat indelicately.Responding to press reports of the meeting, Selmayr tweeted a non-denial denial saying: “On the EU side, nobody is considering this.”He added: “Asked whether any assurance would help to get the withdrawal agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were ... inconclusive...”What Selmayr did make clear to the group, having emphasised that he, no more than they, was not a negotiator, was that the EU was unlikely to concede anything new without cast-iron guarantees from the UK that would swing the Commons behind them.Any premature offer, Brussels knows, could simply be pocketed by Brexiteers with an endless series of demands for yet more. We are not going there.Kinnock reported that “Selmayr’s question to the Brexiteers was: If we did that, would you vote it through? And they weren’t able to answer that question.”Tory Brexiteer MP Stephen Crabb acknowledged the secretary general was concerned that adding the legally-binding assurance would be worthless if offered to MPs.‘Legal protocol’Crabb told the Express: “We talked around the idea of the Tusk letter being written into some sort of legal protocol but everytime someone asked him if it is something he could do, he said first of all it’s not me negotiating and secondly let me turn around the question – if we were to do that would you be guaranteed to vote for the deal?”A commission spokeswoman on Tuesday described the account as the most accurate report of the meeting – probably the first time the Eurosceptic paper had ever been praised by the commission.In truth few believe that these assurances, even in legally-binding form, could provide Theresa May with anything like the swing votes for her deal that she needs. If this is indeed what she will be seeking in her visit here on Thursday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Juncker and Tusk letter of assurance was sent to the British prime minister last month to help clarify the EU understanding of the backstop, and specifically to respond to demands for a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from it. But it made clear that the EU is not in a position to resile from or in any way undermine the obligations set out in the withdrawal agreement, specifically its Northern Ireland protocol.‘Facilitate the next steps’“As you know,” the letter says, “we are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement, but against this background, and in order to facilitate the next steps of the process, we are happy to confirm, on behalf of the two EU institutions we represent, our understanding . . . ”That understanding involves a joint view of the backstop as a malign necessity which can only be temporary “unless and until” it is replaced by an agreement on a future relationship which provides the sort of guarantees necessary to safeguard a frictionless border.The commission commits to entering negotiations and proceeding with them as expeditiously as possible with a view to ensuring that when the extendable transition period of two years comes to an end it will not be necessary to trigger the backstop.Why anyone should believe that a reiteration of that kind of assurance, whether or not in legally binding form, would help build a May majority is not clear. As Martin Selmayr appears to have pointed out.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

He was speaking after talks with  Leo Varadkar in Brussels. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFigures from the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill said they would definitely speak out fi the Belfast Agreement was threatened.Britain’s hope of striking a trade deal with the United States after Brexit could be in jeopardy if the Belfast Agreement is compromised by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, senior US figures have warned.Speaking at an event in the United States Capitol building to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, Republican congressman Peter King told an audience: “If the British want to consider any type of trade agreement with the United States it is important that the soft border is maintained.”He continued: “What influence we have, we will use it, in the Friends of Ireland” he said, referring to the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill. “We will definitely speak out.”His warning was echoed by Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who was recently appointed chairman of the Ways and Means committee. The committee has sweeping powers over US trade policy, and would have ultimate oversight of any trade agreement signed between the United States and Britain after Brexit.Trade dealSpeaking at the event, which was hosted to honour Tánaiste Simon Coveney who is on a three-day visit to the United States, Mr Neal said that concerns about the Belfast Agreement would “weigh on his mind” as his committee considers a new trade deal between the United States and Britain.He said he has already outlined his concerns to the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, although he ultimately wanted a trade deal between the US and United Kingdom.“I think that America is heavily invested in the success of the Good Friday Agreement and anything that might disturb the success that America offered certainly would not be welcomed, that’s for sure. I think there are few parts of American foreign policy that have worked as well as being an honest broker in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, so we take great satisfaction in what happened and undoing it for a problem that appears as though the British government got themselves into, I think would be a step backwards.”In addition to Mr Neal, two other Irish-Americans – Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania and New York congressman Brian Higgins – are members of the committee.Later, in a speech, Mr Neal commended the Irish Government for the stance it has taken in the Brexit negotiations. “The way that the Irish government has remained so firm on that border is so gratifying to us here,” he said, noting that all parties in Ireland and Northern Ireland except one were unified on the issue.“It is extraordinary that that border has been as successful as it has been and there might even be a debate about going back to checkpoints,” he said.Former congressman Bruce Morrison also warned Britain about the difficulties ahead in negotiating a trade agreement with the United States – a key priority for Brexiteers who have pointed to their ability to negotiate a future trade deal with the United States, and other non-EU countries, as a key economic benefit of leaving the EU customs union. The US is Britain’s main trading partner outside the EU bloc, and exports to the US are worth an estimated 100 billion pounds to the British economy each year.“I think the British have made a lot of assumptions about trade agreements with the US and with other countries and frankly, from a hard-headed economic standpoint, dealing with the EU is a lot more important than dealing with Britain, so I think they have an uphill slog on that,” Mr Morrison said. “They’ve been talking to themselves and not talking to others in thinking how great it’s going to be to be out of the European Union.”Face-to-face meetingThe intervention from Capitol Hill came hours after Mr Coveney held his first face-to-face meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event in the US State Department, at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the need to protect the peace process in the context of Brexit.But Mr Coveney stressed that Ireland was not asking the United States to “take sides” amid increasing concern among the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill about the implications of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement.“I made it very clear to him that we’re not asking the US to take sides – Ireland over the UK or UK over Ireland,” Mr Coveney said. “But we are asking people here to think about a peace process that they have been very much involved in creating and sustaining, and using influence to ensure that decisions that are taken in relation to Brexit don’t undermine that progress.”Nonetheless, he said that Mr Pompeo, as well as representatives of other nations attending the global coalition against Isis on Wednesday, had discussed Brexit. “Obviously there have been a lot of questions today from US voices, but also many of the other ministers who were here today for the conference, all asking the same questions – where is this going, how can we avoid a no deal Brexit.”Mr Coveney’s visit continues on Thursday with bilateral meetings with member of Congress about Brexit and its implications for the border with Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVirginia governor-elect Ralph Northam (centre) celebrates with lieutenant governor-elect Justin Fairfax and attorney general Mark Herring at Mr Northam’s election night rally in Fairfax, Virginia, in November 2017. All three men are fighting for their political lives. Photograph:  Aaron P BernsteinReutersThe political crisis in Virginia deepened on Wednesday when the attorney general admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s at a college party, becoming the state’s third high-ranking Democrat caught up in scandal.Attorney general Mark Herring (57), who has expressed gubernatorial ambitions and called four days ago for Mr Northam to resign, admitted in a statement he donned brown face paint at a party in 1980 to impersonate a rapper.Mr Northam (59) acknowledged last weekend to having worn blackface – a practice dating to 19th century minstrel shows caricaturing slaves – in 1984 to impersonate Michael Jackson. His admission came after a conservative media website published a photo on Friday from Mr Northam’s page in his 1984 medical school yearbook showing one man wearing blackface beside another masked figure in robes of the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. After initially saying he was one of the two depicted in the photo, Mr Northam changed his story and said neither was him.A separate scandal engulfing Democratic lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax (39), who is black and would succeed Mr Northam were he to step down, intensified on Wednesday when a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.Mr Herring, who like Mr Northam is white, is second in line to succeed the governor as attorney general.Republican twistThe simultaneous controversies embroiling the top three-elected politicians in the executive branch of Virginia’s government raised the unlikely prospect of Democrats losing the governorship to a Republican. Kirk Cox, Republican speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates, is third in the constitutional line of succession.Mr Cox (61), a former high school teacher who has served in the state’s Republican-controlled House since 1990, issued a statement on Wednesday saying the controversies in the executive branch “are disturbing” but “will be resolved in due course”. In the meantime, lawmakers would focus on budget deliberations and “hundreds of bills remaining before us”.Legislators otherwise kept a low profile on Wednesday, ducking reporters as they left the state capitol in Richmond following Wednesday’s legislative session.Mr Northam has remained out of public view since Saturday, when he held a news conference to address the furore over his yearbook pictures, which sparked calls for his resignation from fellow Democrats in Virginia, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential race.Civil rights groups and at least five Democratic candidates for the White House also have urged Mr Northam to step down.Despite the Democratic Party’s current zero tolerance for bigotry and sexual misconduct, Democrats might be motivated to rally behind Mr Northam if faced with the prospect of Republicans suddenly assuming the governorship.In his statement, Mr Cox singled out the allegations against Fairfax as “extremely serious”. The lieutenant governor has acknowledged knowing his accuser but on Wednesday repeated his assertion their encounter was consensual.The woman, Vanessa Tyson, in a statement issued by Washington law firm Katz, Marshall \u0026amp Banks, said that Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room.“I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual,” Ms Tyson said in the statement, which was published by multiple US media outlets.The same website that disclosed Mr Northam’s yearbook photo was the first to report Ms Tyson’s allegations on Monday.RespectAfter she came forward, Mr Fairfax again denied wrongdoing but asked that she be treated with respect. “But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true,” he said in a statement.Elected officials in both parties have recently seen their careers ended by allegations of racism and sexual misconduct.Florida’s Republican secretary of state last month resigned after a newspaper published a photo of him wearing blackface at a 2005 costume party.Democratic US senator Al Franken resigned in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct.Attorney general Mr Herring said in a statement on Wednesday he now realised he showed poor judgement by dressing as a rapper and donning a wig and brown make-up to perform a song with similarly attired friends.“I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behaviour could inflict on others,” he said. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

They violate the respect that is owed to democratic choices made by a nation which is a friend and an ally, the foreign ministry said.To disagree is one thing, to exploit a relationship for electoral aims is another, it added.The yellow vest protests against fuel taxes began in rural and small-town France in November, but have ballooned into a wider revolt against Macron\u0027s policies and governing style.Di Maio had already denounced the French government for protecting the elite and the privileged, saying a new Europe is being born of the \u0027yellow vests\u0027, of movements, of direct democracy.De Maio\u0027s fellow deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has also lambasted Macron directly.I hope the French will be able to free themselves of a terrible president, Salvini said in a Facebook video last month.The opportunity will come on May 26 (the European elections) when finally the French people will be able to take back control of their future, destiny, (and) pride, which are poorly represented by a character like Macron, he said.Please review our commenting policyPoliticians and quangos should stop telling people how much pizza and alcohol they can have, minister saysBrexit latest news: UK and EU locked in Brexit stalemate after Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker refuse to budge in crunch talksUK weather: Storm Erik on its way to Britain as yellow warning for 60mph winds issued England and ScotlandHove cafe owner turns down applicant because \u0026#39British people have a poor work ethic\u0026#39 Theresa May polls latest: How the Prime Minister\u0026#39s approval rating has been affected by Brexit negotiationsMalaysia deputy foreign minister urged to quit over \u0026#39fake Cambridge degree\u0026#39Comment: When did Brexiteers become such a bunch of pearl-clutching snowflakes?Outcry over Uganda plan to draw tourists with \u0026#39curvy women\u0026#39 Libby Squire: Polish father arrested in Hull on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing studentIndian state to give £410 gold to every bride from a poor family in pre-election giveawayTheresa May gives death stare to Jean-Claude Juncker as they remain locked in Brexit stalemateComment: May faces three simple choices: betray Northern Ireland, your people, or exit without a dealCan Mrs May learn the lessons of her past failures in Brussels?GP surgeries to be provided with in-house lawyers for patients Comment: The EU has a special place in hell for Mrs May: doing a Brexit deal with the Labour devilComment: The backlash against Turning Point UK rather proves its point it\u0026#39s hard being a conservative on campusLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing Hull studentWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?The EU is furious with Theresa May and will leave her empty-handed -

It\u0027s probably better you did not succeed in getting the job because you can never be late for or miss work at our business. Ever.Victoria Atkins was shocked at the remarksWe are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics.The Trades Union Congress has condemned his attitude and defended British workers, who the organisation claims put in some of the longest hours in Europe.Ms Atkins from Brighton, East Sussex, said: He is very rude and nasty.I\u0027d had a really bad morning and just asked if I could rebook the trial shift.I\u0027d taken the bus and left plenty of time, but due to delays I soon realised I would be late.By this time I was soaking wet because the bus only went half way, and my friend lives on the same road as the cafe so I went there to shower and dry off.I was already a couple of hours late so asked if I could go at a later date, which is when he said no.Don\u0027t get me wrong, I understand why he didn\u0027t let me just do another shift, but his comments about British people having no work ethic were shocking.She added that the comment about eating bacon left her very, very offended.Mr Preston-Powers defended  his remarks. He said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop.The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British.It is true, comprehensively, that every single one of the British employees that we\u0027ve had will call in and have some issues, or be late. But when you have someone who comes from a country where there are no jobs and appreciate they have a job, they work every single hour.It\u0027s just a preference and making it very clear and being honest about what genre of people have the best work ethic.A TUC spokesperson said: If he\u0027s looking for the title of Britain\u0027s Worst Boss, it sounds like he\u0027s going about it the right way.It\u0027s illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity. Britain\u0027s workers have a very strong work ethic. They put in some of the longest hours in Europe and billions of pounds worth of unpaid overtime each year.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: UK and EU locked in Brexit stalemate after Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker refuse to budge in crunch talksUK weather: Storm Erik on its way to Britain as yellow warning for 60mph winds issued England and ScotlandTheresa May polls latest: How the Prime Minister\u0026#39s approval rating has been affected by Brexit negotiationsMalaysia deputy foreign minister urged to quit over \u0026#39fake Cambridge degree\u0026#39Comment: When did Brexiteers become such a bunch of pearl-clutching snowflakes?Outcry over Uganda plan to draw tourists with \u0026#39curvy women\u0026#39 Libby Squire: Polish father arrested in Hull on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing studentIndian state to give £410 gold to every bride from a poor family in pre-election giveawayFrance recalls ambassador to Rome after Italian deputy PM met with \u0026#39yellow vests\u0026#39Theresa May gives death stare to Jean-Claude Juncker as they remain locked in Brexit stalemateComment: May faces three simple choices: betray Northern Ireland, your people, or exit without a dealCan Mrs May learn the lessons of her past failures in Brussels?GP surgeries to be provided with in-house lawyers for patients Comment: The EU has a special place in hell for Mrs May: doing a Brexit deal with the Labour devilComment: The backlash against Turning Point UK rather proves its point it\u0026#39s hard being a conservative on campusLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing Hull studentWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?The EU is furious with Theresa May and will leave her empty-handed - as accidental no-deal Brexit loomsConjoined twins trapped in Yemen warzone as doctors plead for evacuationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/07/TELEMMGLPICT000161482556_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeK8ehqBZJSTiVTgumtathbH8AD1LYTdJsoz8pklmEgw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"indian state give 410 gold every bride poor family pre election","story":"In the state of Assam it is customary for daughters to be given sets of gold ornaments after getting marriedAn Indian state will give gold worth about £410 to every bride from a poor family, the latest budget giveaway ahead of a general election that must be held by May.The northeastern state of Assam is run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u0027s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is facing a battle for re-election because of low farm incomes and a lack of jobs that have turned off some of those who backed it in the last polls, in 2014.The federal government announced cash handouts to farmers and tax cuts for the lower middle class last week.On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut interest rates for the first time since 2017, in line with a government demand as it attempts to stimulate the economy.The opposition Congress party has also been forgiving farmers\u0027 loans and announcing it would provide the unemployed with cash handouts in some of the states it controls.But handing out gold to brides is new.The tea-growing state\u0027s finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, allocated 3 billion rupees for the next fiscal year, from April 1, for the gold programme.That would buy 875 kg of gold, enough for about 80,000 brides.A customary ritual which has been part of Assamese society for centuries is to gift a set of gold ornaments to one\u0027s daughter as a blessing as she leaves her father\u0027s home to start a new life, Mr Sarma said in his budget speech on Wednesday.He said the programme should stop families falling into debt to pay for daughters\u0027 weddings.I feel that it\u0027s my solemn responsibility to stand with those fathers who cannot afford to gift a set of gold ornaments, he said.The Assam government would buy the gold from the RBI and give it to the beneficiaries directly, Mr Sarma told Reuters on Thursday.The programme would be limited to two women from each family with an income of less than 500,000 rupees a year. Each bride would get a tola, or 11.66 grams, of gold.Indian brides traditionally get gold, which helps make the country the world\u0027s second-biggest buyer of the metal after China. The World Gold Council expects India to consume 750-850 tonnes of gold this year.Please review our commenting policyPoliticians and quangos should stop telling people how much pizza and alcohol they can have, minister saysBrexit latest news: UK and EU locked in Brexit stalemate after Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker refuse to budge in crunch talksUK weather: Storm Erik on its way to Britain as yellow warning for 60mph winds issued England and ScotlandHove cafe owner turns down applicant because \u0026#39British people have a poor work ethic\u0026#39 Theresa May polls latest: How the Prime Minister\u0026#39s approval rating has been affected by Brexit negotiationsMalaysia deputy foreign minister urged to quit over \u0026#39fake Cambridge degree\u0026#39Comment: When did Brexiteers become such a bunch of pearl-clutching snowflakes?Outcry over Uganda plan to draw tourists with \u0026#39curvy women\u0026#39 Libby Squire: Polish father arrested in Hull on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing studentFrance recalls ambassador to Rome after Italian deputy PM met with \u0026#39yellow vests\u0026#39Theresa May gives death stare to Jean-Claude Juncker as they remain locked in Brexit stalemateComment: May faces three simple choices: betray Northern Ireland, your people, or exit without a dealCan Mrs May learn the lessons of her past failures in Brussels?GP surgeries to be provided with in-house lawyers for patients Comment: The EU has a special place in hell for Mrs May: doing a Brexit deal with the Labour devilComment: The backlash against Turning Point UK rather proves its point it\u0026#39s hard being a conservative on campusLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing Hull studentWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?The EU is furious with Theresa May and will leave her empty-handed - as accidental no-deal Brexit loomsConjoined twins trapped in Yemen warzone as doctors plead for evacuationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/07/TELEMMGLPICT000187744208_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOlre2XI56yo4l_IDofEYB8ojHqa2Q4TcJA5isZ8nj1M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"outcry uganda plan draw tourists curvy women","story":"Tourism Minister Godfrey Kiwanda unveiled the campaign on Wednesday at a press conference surrounded by womenUgandan activists on Thursday slammed a government campaign to use curvy women as a tourism product, which has sparked a furore in the east African nation.Tourism Minister Godfrey Kiwanda unveiled the campaign on Wednesday at a press conference attended by a bevy of curvaceous women.Uganda is endowed with beautiful women. Their beauty is unique and erse. That\u0027s why we decided to use the unique beauty, the curves... to make this beauty a product to be marketed along with what we already have as a country ranging from nature, the language and food, to make it a tourist attraction, Mr Kiwanda told AFP on Thursday.Part of the plan to market Ugandan women is a beauty pageant, Miss Curvy Uganda, to be held in June.The winner of the Miss Curvy contest was to be part of our tourism campaign brand using beauty as one other product of tourism, Mr Kiwanda said.Ugandan women have been outraged by the campaign and called for Kiwanda\u0026#39s resignationUgandan women were outraged at the proposal and have called for Mr Kiwanda\u0027s resignation.This is perversion. To think women can be used as sex objects in this age and time is an absurdity and we condemn it, Rita Aciro, executive director of the Uganda Women\u0027s Network, told AFP.Ugandan entrepreneur and activist Primrose Nyonyozi Murungi launched an online petition to stop the campaign, which she said was totally unacceptable and demeaning to us.Women in Uganda have been attacked while on the streets. What happens now that the government is confirming a stereotype that women are sexual objects and can be touched regardless and more so made a product of tourism, she told AFP.She said that if the campaign was not stopped immediately, the petitioners would take their case to court.Violence against women is a global, but prevalence varies widelyIn addition to Mr Kiwanda\u0027s resignation, she has demanded an apology from the government.Former opposition leader in parliament Winnie Kiiza told AFP the move came at the time (when) women face fear and stigma in a male-dominated society.We have been outraged by this campaign that a government can parade curves of women as a tourist attraction, she said.Mr Kiwanda, trying to stem the anger, insisted the campaign was not aimed at demeaning women.Diverse as we are as a country we have a message to put out there about the different curves our women have, which we believe is a tourism attraction.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: UK and EU locked in Brexit stalemate after Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker refuse to budge in crunch talksUK weather: Storm Erik on its way to Britain as yellow warning for 60mph winds issued England and ScotlandHove cafe owner turns down applicant because \u0026#39British people have a poor work ethic\u0026#39 Theresa May polls latest: How the Prime Minister\u0026#39s approval rating has been affected by Brexit negotiationsMalaysia deputy foreign minister urged to quit over \u0026#39fake Cambridge degree\u0026#39Comment: When did Brexiteers become such a bunch of pearl-clutching snowflakes?

That forecast in the bank’s latest Inflation Report is down sharply from the 1.7 per cent growth it estimated in November and would be the feeblest performance since GDP plummeted by 1.4 per cent in 2009.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019.\u0026nbsp“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Yet the bank stressed that even this much weaker outlook was conditioned on a “smooth adjustment” to life outside the EU. Last December it published stress-test scenario for banks in which a no-deal Brexit could plunge Britain into the worst recession since the 1920s, with GDP collapsing by 8 per cent.Speaking at the Bank\u0027s press conference the Governor, Mark Carney, said the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU had gone up.\u0026nbspI would have described no-deal, no transition a few years ago as a low probability event.

In the same sitting, MPs also voted against a no-deal Brexit in a non-legally binding motion4142 EU council president savages Brexit campaigners who failed to plan for departure: ‘Special place in hell’There is a “special place in hell” for pro-Brexit campaigners who demanded Britain leave the EU without explaining how it should happen, Donald Tusk has said. The European Council president launched the scathing attack as he accused anti-EU campaigners of pushing for Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” Mr Tusk also dismissed suggestions that the EU could reopen negotiations over the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, dealing a blow to Theresa May‘s hopes of securing fresh concessions as she tries to get her exit deal through parliament. Speaking in Brussels alongside Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Tusk said: “I’ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” He also tweeted the accusation moments later4242 EU and UK announce talks to restart after Theresa May visits BrusselsBoth have agreed to restart Brexit talks to find “a way through” the deadlock in Westminster, following a visit by Theresa May to Brussels. In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month. But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadIn November the bank had expected business investment to grow by 2 per cent in 2019. Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter-point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.Brexit impact on investment“The Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country, said\u0026nbspJames Smith of the the Resolution Foundation:“Today’s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag.”The bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved, UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy, according to the bank.The bank reiterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter-point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.Brexit impact on investment“The Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country, said\u0026nbspJames Smith of the the Resolution Foundation:“Today’s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag.”The bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved, UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy, according to the bank.The bank reiterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling fell 0.45 per cent against the dollar to hit £1.2874 and dropped 0.13 per cent against the euro to €1.1365.The central bank’s monetary policy committee voted unanimously to hold interest rates at 0.75 per cent but warned that Brexit uncertainty will slash UK economic growth in 2019 to the weakest rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago even if the UK manages to secure an orderly departure from the European Union next month.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe central bank now expects growth in 2019 to come in at only 1.2 per cent, driven by slumping business investment.Threadneedle Street also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019. “This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the Bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was a 1.4 percentage point increase on the application rate in 2018.It comes despite a 1.8 per cent fall in the overall number of 18-year-olds in England.Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said: “I expect the confirmation of home fee status next year could have helped the numbers, although so could the weak pound as it makes life in the UK cheaper for both EU and non-EU students.”The number of applicants from China increased by a third this year - rising to 15,880, which brings Chinese applicant numbers to almost the same level as those from Wales and Northern Ireland.On the rise of applications from 18-year-olds, Ms Stevens added: “These figures show there remains a strong appetite for university study. Time spent at university opens-up lifelong opportunities for students and prepares them for an uncertain and competitive job market.”Universities accept fewer students as overall A-level pass rate dropsUniversities \u0027should do more to tackle student mental health crisis\u0027Unconditional offers may mean A-level students take \u0027foot off the gas\u0027Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) think tank, told The Independent: “There is so much uncertainty at the moment with Brexit but getting a degree is almost an insurance policy against future problems.”He added: “We know that the people that are most worried about Brexit are young people. They are the ones who think, rightly or wrongly, that the future has been made more difficult for them.“The more highly skilled you are, the better your life chances. It is a very rational thing that young people are doing.”James Seymour, director of admissions at the University of Buckingham, said: “Although there’s lots of uncertainty around Brexit there’s a feeling of certainty when it comes to doing a degree in the UK.“There’s a feeling of ‘it’s my choice’ regardless of what is going on with Brexit. There have been some question marks over apprenticeships but people feel they can trust a degree.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: In this time of uncertainty, it\u0027s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.Alongside this, demand from UK 18-year-old students remains strong, despite the falling numbers of this age group in the population.The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: It\u0027s excellent to see that 18-year-olds in England increasingly value a university education, with a record rate of applications.We are also pleased to see a record high in the percentage of young people from disadvantaged areas applying to university.However, we need to be more ambitious. To retain a competitive advantage on the global stage post-Brexit we must encourage and support more of the population through higher level study.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Nasa status report of the incident revealed that the crew used towels to mop up the floating mess aboard the ISS.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe crew successfully installed a new double stall enclosure within Node 3 today, the report stated.During the activity, the crew experienced a water leak while de-mating a Quick Disconnect (QD) for the potable water bus. Approximately 9.5 liters leaked before the bus was isolated by MCC-H flight controllers. The crew worked quickly to re-mate the leaky QD and soak up the water with towels.Created with Sketch.A visitor’s guide to the International Space Station Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The training\u0027s over, Tim… next stop: the greatest lab in the universe!

As anyone who has worked on plumbing in their own home knows, these types of things sometimes happen, a NASA spokesperson said.Flight controllers evaluated the module\u0027s systems and didn\u0027t find any damage after the water was cleaned up. Astronauts then finished installing the new double stall enclosure in preparation for a new toilet system to be delivered to the space station in 2020.In December, the ISS crew was forced to deal with a mysterious hole that appeared on the outside of the orbiting lab.One member of the crew suggested the strange gap was caused by someone drilling a hole in the space station from the inside.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Cook travels to Brussels to meet the famous duo, who have\u0026nbspturned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artworkClick to followThe IndependentGilbert and George outside their house in Spitalfields: ‘We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us’In a dilapidated old arsenal on the industrial edge of Brussels, Gilbert and George are singing the music hall song that made them famous. Their audience seem a bit bemused, and who on earth can blame them? “Underneath the Arches” is as British as warm\u0026nbspbeer or test match cricket, and equally incomprehensible to European punters. First performed by a very different duo, Flanagan and Allen, way back in the 1930s, it was already a golden oldie when Gilbert and George started singing it in art galleries 50 years ago.Half a century later, it’s become the theme tune for their lifelong career as Living Sculptures. No wonder these continental liggers are nonplussed. To anyone who isn’t steeped in British culture, with its weird passion for nostalgia, Gilbert and George must seem very odd indeed. “We never wanted to be weird because all artists like the idea of being weird, and we never wanted to be normal because everybody’s normal,” says George, by way of explanation. “We like to be weird and normal at the same time.”Gilbert and George are here in Brussels to open Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs. Each year, a famous artist is invited to be Brafa’s guest of honour. Last year, it was Christo. This year, it’s Gilbert and George. Their big bold artworks are scattered around this huge hall, an incongruous contrast to the antique paintings that surround them.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis juxtaposition is surreal – and here in the Belgian capital, the city of Magritte, that’s really rather fitting. For Brexit-obsessed Britons, Brussels may be synonymous with the European Union, but for Europeans it’s always been synonymous with surrealism – and what could possibly be more surreal than Gilbert and George?Despite their matching suits, and shirts and ties, they’re easy to tell apart. George looks like Eric Morecambe. Gilbert looks like Ernie Wise. However, unlike Eric and Ernie, they’re more than just a double act. They live together, they work together, they always appear in public together. This has been their way of life since they met, in London, in 1967, at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins). Their artworks are striking, and often bizarrely beautiful, but they’re a sideshow compared to their greatest work of art: themselves.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George: portraits and works Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George in their local cafe in Spitalfields, 2017Gilbert and George outside of their favourite restaurant, Mangal II, a Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington 2017 Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Gilbert and George, 2015Gilbert and George in their younger yearsGilbert and George - SFG (2013)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - HANDBALL (2008)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - TEACHER STRAIGHT (2011)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD RAIDS (2016) Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD MAD (2016)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George, 2017Early morning.

Everyone assumes so, but no one seems to know for sure, and their public life is far more intriguing than whatever they might get up to in private. Young men feature prominently in their work, women are conspicuous by their absence, but you wouldn’t call these pictures homoerotic. Indeed, there’s something strangely sexless about them, like artworks from another planet.Their\u0026nbspDirty Words\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspNaked Shit\u0026nbsppictures caused a predictable furore (the titles are self-explanatory) but most of their work isn’t overtly controversial. The most radical thing about them isn’t their art, but the way they’ve merged their inidual identities into one.‘Fake’ Hitler paintings seized by German police in BerlinThey’re reluctant to discuss the details of their lives before they met, but their backgrounds are fascinating. When pressed, they stress the similarities – they were both war babies from provincial, lower-class, unartistic families – but the differences are far more notable, and the most notable difference is that one half of this very British duo wasn’t originally British at all.Gilbert Prousch was born in a small village in the Italian Dolomites in 1943. His father was a shoemaker, like his grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather before him, but after the war mass-produced shoes became much cheaper and so Gilbert’s father struggled to make a living. Inspired by Michaelangelo, Gilbert studied art in Salzburg and then in Munich, where he heard about St Martin’s. He travelled to London and wangled a place on its internationally renowned advanced sculpture course. He didn’t speak a word of English. He still speaks with a strong Italian accent today.George Passmore, conversely, speaks like a BBC newsreader from the 1950s. He was born in Devon in 1942. His father left home soon after George was born, possibly before. His mother was uninhibited, and George had a succession of “uncles”, which must have exposed him to gossip in postwar Totnes. At state school he showed a talent for art, which eventually won him a place at Dartington Hall, a private school renowned for its progressive attitudes. Inspired by Van Gogh’s letters, he went on to art school, and ended up at St Martin’s, on the advanced sculpture course, with Gilbert Prousch.“George took an interest in me,” says Gilbert. They became friends – and then lovers? Last time I met them, in their home in London, I asked them if it was love at first sight. “No,” said George. He described their relationship as something that happened gradually, “like an atmosphere or a cloud”. Do they ever wonder what might have happened if they’d never met? The idea clearly seems inconceivable to them. They believe they were destined to be together. “It was fate,” says Gilbert.The sculpture course at St Martin’s was (in)famously laissez-faire. Students could do whatever they wanted, which suited Gilbert and George just fine. “St Martin’s was the best art school in the world,” says Gilbert. “This was a school that said to an artist, ‘Anything goes. You are free to think in different ways.’ No other art school did that.” His art training in Munich had been traditional and academic. “St Martin’s was different – anything could be art.”Their fellow students included Barry Flanagan, Bruce McLean and, most notably, Richard Long, who turned walking into an artform. Gilbert and George went even further. They turned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artwork. As Gilbert says, “We were the centre of our art.”While Long set off into the wilderness, Gilbert and George wandered around London’s East End. It was here, in a Dickensian junk shop, that they found an old record of “Underneath the Arches”, and came up with the idea of singing along to it, for hours and hours on end. They called this artwork The Singing Sculpture. “We felt we were doing something different,” says Gilbert. Like all the best ideas, it was both in keeping with, yet contrary to, the spirit of the times. Conceptual art was all the rage, but most of it was terribly earnest. Their Singing Sculpture was full of fun.Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs\u0026nbsp(Fabrice Debatty)“For the artists who were showing in those galleries, colour was taboo, figuration was taboo, sex was taboo, feeling was taboo – and these were all of the things we were interested in,” says George. Other artists got drunk in the evening, then went back into the studio in the morning to make sombre, sober art. Gilbert and George turned their drunken revels into art.They couldn’t get any public subsidy, and they had no family money to support them. Looking back, they now believe this gave them an advantage. “We could feel more free – we didn’t have to fit in in any way,” says George. “Middle-class people are more constrained.”They got their big break at a group show in London called When Attitudes Become Form. When the curator declined to include their work they gatecrashed the private view, and stole the show with their Living Sculptures, standing in the middle of the gallery like showroom dummies. Konrad Fischer saw them at this show, and asked them to perform in Düsseldorf. In Düsseldorf they were seen by Illeana Sonnabend, who invited them to New York. Fischer and Sonnabend were two of the world’s most influential art dealers. Gilbert and George had arrived.Around the same time they moved into a Georgian townhouse in Fournier Street, in London’s Spitalfields. They’ve lived there ever since. It was a poor area when they moved in. It’s got a lot smarter since, but it’s still a tough old place. The tramps that used to live there have been replaced by drug addicts, but they don’t mind this shifting cityscape – they embrace it. “We are very optimistic people,” says George. “We are never against anything.”Like a lot of their boldest statements, this is only partly true. They were certainly against the artistic orthodoxy of the 1960s and 1970s. In their suits and ties and starched white shirts they stood out a mile. “To be an artist you had to be critical. You had to be against the bomb, or against America, or against the Conservatives or against Labour,” says George. “We thought, ‘How marvellous it would be if we didn’t have to be Anti!’” It’s a philosophy they maintain when people bring petitions to their front door. “If it’s for something, we sign it. If it’s against something, we don’t sign it. We must have signed for some horrible things, but at least we were for.”Living in Spitalfields has been absolutely central to their art. “We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us,” Gilbert tells me. “It’s an amazing mixture of different kinds of people.” Spitalfields has long been a refuge for arriving immigrants: Huguenots, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims… “The East End of London is a mixture of so many countries, a mixture of so many different people.” This is just the way they like it. “You face the modern world whenever you step out of the front door,” says George.They’ve exhibited all around the world, but though their pictures attract a lot of interest, wherever they go the main attraction is always Gilbert and George. It’s the same story here in Brussels. It’s like attending a press conference with Quentin Crisp and Oscar Wilde. Sure, it’s the same show every time, more or less, endless variations on a single theme, but it’s still more entertaining and enlightening than talking to any other artists I can think of.They set off for a walk around Brafa, followed by a swarm of hacks. “Our motto is ban religion,” says Gilbert, as they pause for photos in front of one of their monumental pictures. Religion loomed large in both their childhoods: Gilbert was raised a Catholic George’s brother became a vicar. Their artworks are oddly reminiscent of stained glass windows, but they’re both devout atheists. “We don’t believe in God,” says Gilbert. “All the gods are manmade. We are in charge of what we are doing in this world.”“We’ve always firmly believed that the national galleries of the world should remove all of the Christian art and hand it back to the Church,” says George. “They can look after the insurance and maintenance and conservation, and give over the national museums to humanist art, not Judeo-Christian voodoo.” George tells a story about an elderly vicar who knocked on their front door. “I thought it was marvellous that you said Ban Religion,” he told them. “My congregation come to church every week, and they’re all very religious. But I don’t want them to be religious. I want them to be good.”“We believe in the enlightenment, when people became human for their own sake,” adds Gilbert. “They didn’t need God anymore to make themselves human.” Their heroes are Charles Darwin and Alan Turing.We stop in front of a montage they made from tabloid posters, which they stole from outside newsagents. “It’s not a very easy thing to do because the shopkeepers don’t like you to do that, so one of us would go into the shop to distract the shopkeeper while the other stole the poster,” confesses George. “After three and a half years we ended up with more than 3,700 posters, and then we ided them into subjects – the ones which said Rape, the ones that said Murder, the ones that said Mugged, and ended up with a very big group of pictures.” They only got caught once. “We were very polite and gave it back to the shop, but we went the next night and stole it again.”‘Honest posters’ take down this year’s Oscar nomineesMan mistaken for employee strolls out of art gallery with $1m paintingThe rise of graphic novels, from To Kill a Mockingbird to SabrinaDespite these rebellious attitudes, they’re reassuringly old-fashioned. They don’t use the internet, or mobile phones. The only time they use the telephone is to book a table at the local restaurant where they’ve eaten for the past 20 years. After 50 years in the spotlight, they still maintain they’re outside the art establishment.Maybe they were, once upon a time (when they met, in 1967, homosexuality had only just been decriminalised) but that time has long since passed. Today they’re Royal Academicians who’ve exhibited in virtually every major gallery across the globe. If they were ever anti-establishment, the establishment has long since absorbed them. Yet for all their success there’s still something discreetly anarchic about them, a hint of danger behind their impeccable manners and immaculately tailored suits.They’re now lionised by the art world, but they don’t like hobnobbing with other artists. “We had friends in London, Paris, Germany, New York, a huge group of friends – drinking, celebrating, parties – and then one day we cut it off, we stopped,” says George. “We realised it was all to do with gossip and business – the nightmare of a world that has nothing to do with being an artist.” “We wanted to be free of gossiping,” says Gilbert. “We have friends, but we don’t want artist friends.” Though the art world has appropriated them, and sanctified them, they’re still outsiders at heart.So what advice would they give to an aspiring young artist starting out today? “Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, sit on the edge of your bed, keep your eyes closed, and don’t open them and stand up until you have decided, ‘What do I want to say to the world today?’” says George. Gilbert’s advice is a lot more succinct: “Fuck the teachers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

(I agree that your game is the world’s game never mind that our “Super Bowl” winners declare themselves “world champions.”)The “firsts” did not end there. It was my first match outside the United States my first trip to Manchester even my first press pass.

So many great contributions to humanity were born here, in the world’s first modern industrial city. The first passenger railway.\u0026nbspI took a train from London to get here! The first professional football league. I visited the national football museum! The first hipster reclaiming of gritty industrial city spaces in pursuit of authenticity. I passed by a group of men shooting up under a railway bridge along the canal path during my morning run!This World Cup shows how far women in football have comeThis felt like a trip to mecca because I was born and raised a football lover. Both footballs. In the United States, girls play soccer – maybe even more than boys – and from the time I could walk I craved to run free in fields and play games. In soccer, I relished the sensations of movement and power, playing midfield, running everywhere on the pitch.\u0026nbspI also grew up a die-hard American college football fan, worshipping in Michigan Stadium, a place we lovingly call “the Big House.” (Capacity is officially 107, 601, but we’ve been known to cram in upwards of 115,000.)For years I watched every game and participated in all the home game rituals and traditions with my dad, who was and still is a season ticketholder with the Wolverines. We always arrived early to watch teams warm up, listen to the PA announcer perform his introductory script, and cheer the team as they took the field, players jumping to tap the “M Club Supports You” banner at midfield.Created with Sketch.Your First Football Shirt: a collection of famous football memories Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alan Shearer, Lucy Bronze, Dwight Yorke and other footballers and famous fans discuss their first football shirt as well as some of their fondest football memories231 Andrei Kanchelskis winning the 1990 European Under 21 Championship for the Soviet UnionAndrei Kanchelskis: In my mind, winning a trophy for your country at any level is one of the greatest accolades.”331 Dwight Yorke on winning the treble for Manchester United in 1999Dwight Yorke: “Winning the treble with Manchester United will always be my favourite achievement in football.”431 Graeme Le Saux on scoring for England v BrazilGraeme Le Saux: Scoring against Brazil is definitely up there531 Alan Shearer on breaking Newcastle United’s goal scoring recordAlan Shearer: “I can’t describe the feeling.

In the 1990s I sat in the stands when Tom Brady – whose New England Patriots just won their sixth Super Bowl – was not the Tom Brady we know today, but was second, even third-string, backing up other future NFL quarterbacks at Michigan.If Brits think their families’ and communities’ commitments to football clubs are more authentic than Americans’ because they go back further, they are looking to the wrong league and teams. Our connections and century-long traditions are not found in the NFL, but, rather, with our college football programs that – like your links to British football clubs – go back to the nineteenth century.Patrice Evra sparks backlash for ‘patronising’ applauding of Eni AlukoAnd our rivalries are just as fierce. Michigan’s rival of more than 100 years standing is The Ohio State University: my mother is a graduate and serious fan. She can tell you all the reasons why OSU traditions surpass the Wolverines’, and how Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is a beautiful 0-4 versus her Buckeyes. I learned from my mom that women are real, authentic fans too.Women play and follow football, many as seriously as men. But I experienced another first in Manchester. This was also my first experience in a traditionally male workplace that was still almost entirely, unapologetically, male. The only other women I saw in the press areas were serving food or working on the social media and communications teams for Man City and Arsenal. Pep Guardiola was so surprised to see a woman in the press room post-match that, when we made eye contact, his look of shock was priceless.I get it because I’m a historian. This is your “manly” sport. In the United States, our “manly” sports, historically, also happen to be our most insular and quintessentially American sports: baseball and American football. So while they may not translate neatly, I realise we have similar man-zone problems. In my lifetime, both our countries have worked to improve ersity and inclusion in sports participation and sports industries. We both have a long way to go.For all the claims of inclusivity and ersity that I saw in the national football museum on Saturday, I did not see it reflected in the match coverage on Sunday.Here’s the thing. I know there are hundreds, thousands of women in the UK who grew up playing football, cheering for local teams. They know the game as intimately as men do. They write well. They’re clever and funny and bring unique perspectives to their descriptions and analyses of the game. So why weren’t they in the media area on Sunday, and why was Pep so surprised to see me?Created with Sketch.Male cheerleaders make history at 2019 Super Bowl  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Inclusivity does not happen on its own. It requires ever-present work active, thoughtful decision-making by people in positions of leadership to commit to fundamental changes in their hiring practices, their mentoring cultures and professional growth opportunities, and their fostering of inclusive, healthy workplaces.\u0026nbspAfter all, the original construction of modern sport as a male domain was also man-made.\u0026nbsp(Ha.)I teach sports history at Arizona State University, and this semester I’m teaching a course on the history of baseball, or, rather, what baseball history tells us about American history.\u0026nbspHow multi-billion-dollar US college sports exploit their starsWe explore baseball’s critical role in both promoting and affirming an ideology of the supremacy of white men to hold positions of political, economic, and social authority, both within the United States and abroad.\u0026nbspThis was particularly so as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth when our country began to indulge its imperial ambitions beyond the North American continent. White men were fit to lead the world’s races, proving it through sporting prowess on the football gridiron and baseball diamond. This effort required pushing out people of African descent, and women, who had always been playing and loving baseball but now were forced to create their own separate – and often alternative or underground – teams and leagues to play in.When Jackie Robinson, who would have been 100 this year, desegregated Major League Baseball, joining the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he inspired future generations of young people to stake their rightful claim to sporting spaces despite being told their identities disqualified them.\u0026nbspIdeas about who belongs – and who does not – do not stay in the sport space they leach out and influence ideas about “natural” ability and interest in broader society.Here in England, for 50 years, from 1921 to 1971, the Football Association banned women from football pitches, declaring “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.” By no coincidence, this was at a time that women were gaining confidence both within and beyond sport, securing the right to the vote, enjoying public spaces, and demanding equal treatment in homes and workplaces.\u0026nbspWhat have I learned on my trip of firsts to the city of firsts? Sports hold incredible potential and power for social transformation. Sports are about people, and about bodies, and, most of all, they make us vulnerable. All of us. It’s in the space of vulnerability and strength and power and times of joy and times of pain that we hold the capacity and potential to see the humanity in each other.No matter the location on the planet, women athletes and sports professionals know that sports and politics have always mixed, because we’ve always had to fight so damn hard to play, to write about those who play, to coach and manage and take our seat in the boardroom. We won’t stop fighting to claim our right to play.

Rosalind the rover captures this spirit and carries us all to the forefront of space exploration.”Rosalind Franklin was central to the discovery of DNA, alongside\u0026nbspCrick and Watson, but her part in the work has been historically overlooked. She was not mentioned when Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA, and her name was left out of many science books until the 1990s – but in recent years there has been a major effort to recognise her part in the pioneering work.The lander has already had its landing site chosen ahead of its touchdown in 2021. The area is thought to have once been covered in a large lake, and scientists hope that signatures of life might be lying there.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is unlikely the pair will ever be heard from again.It has been more than a month since the robots were last heard from and they are now millions of miles beyond the red planet.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut Nasa considers the very fact it could talk to them at all a major success. The two craft pushed up against the limits of experimental technology, they say, and helped prove concepts that could allow such tiny robots to venture even more deep into space.MarCO was th first interplanetary mission to use a class of small spacecraft known as\u0026nbspCubeSats. Together, the pair worked as communications relays during the landing of InSight, a Nasa rover that dropped down around New Year and will be delving deep into Mars\u0027s surface.The two spacecraft were able to beam back data during the descent of the lander in near real-time, and sent back the stunning first images that were taken by InSight. The craft even did some science of their own: WALL-E took its own photos, and EVE did some simple radio science.Because the technology was experimental, Nasa weren\u0027t relying on either of the CubeSats working at all. If they had broken on their way – as engineers suspected they might – the data would still have been sent back but it would have taken much longer to receive it.After their work was done at Mars, they carried on off into space. WALL-E hasn\u0027t sent a message since 29 December, and is thought to be more than a million miles past Mars EVE is even further away, at about two million miles, and hasn\u0027t spoken to Nasa since 4 January.Nasa\u0027s Mars InSight lander sends back stunning first selfieResearchers don\u0027t know exactly why the pair have lost touch. WALL-E has a leaky thruster and might be wobbling so that it can\u0027t send commands. The sensors that allow them to charge their batteries from the sun might also have broken.They will continue flying away from Earth as February goes on, making sending any data\u0026nbspever more difficult and so meaning that Nasa don\u0027t expect to ever hear back.This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us, said Andy Klesh, the mission\u0027s chief engineer at JPL. We\u0027ve put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Sterling fell 0.45 per cent against the dollar to hit £1.2874 and dropped 0.13 per cent against the euro to €1.1365.The central bank’s monetary policy committee voted unanimously to hold interest rates at 0.75 per cent but warned that Brexit uncertainty will slash UK economic growth in 2019 to the weakest rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago even if the UK manages to secure an orderly departure from the European Union next month.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe central bank now expects growth in 2019 to come in at only 1.2 per cent, driven by slumping business investment.Threadneedle Street also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019. “This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the Bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But this time, something is different:\u0026nbspthese signals are repeating\u0026nbspevery couple of days.What’s especially exciting is\u0026nbspscientists don’t know what is causing these radio bursts.

Well beyond our galaxy, the Milky Way. Douglas Adams’\u0026nbspline from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy might well have been written especially to describe how far away they’re coming from: “I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space.”The Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years from us the source of the FRBs detected by Chime\u0026nbspis a thousand times more distant than that.Before the project turned its hi-tech gaze on the heavens, there had been only one previously detected incident of a repeating FRB, and that was in 2012. “Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles – where they’re from and what causes them,” says Ingrid Stairs, a member of the Chime team and an astrophysicist at UBC.The fact that scientists don’t know what is generating the FRBs raises the spectre that they are actually the work of some far-flung civilisation.The Seti (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) Institute in California is dedicated to finding evidence of alien life. Senior astronomer Seth Shostak wrote on the Seti website that FRBs in and of themselves weren’t necessarily cause for cracking open the champagne and laying out the interstellar welcome mat.Billions of stars across space turning into enormous crystals“It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common,” Shostak writes. “For example, some folks have argued that Earth might be unique. Maybe there’s only one such bio-friendly world in our galaxy, and we live on it.\u0026nbspBut a more frequently heard opinion is that, among the trillion planets of the Milky Way, there could be many billions that have spawned life.“When, a few years ago, only a handful of FRBs were known, it was unclear whether they were rare or otherwise. Now that more than 60 have been detected, researchers can safely say that there are probably thousands of these things going off every day. They are as ubiquitous as indoor plumbing.”The exciting bit is that the FRB discovered by Chime is repeating. Shostak explains: “There’s a short flash of radio energy – quicker than an eye blink – and then, maybe two days later, it flashes again.“The repetition tells you something about the cause of these radio flashes. Obviously, you can’t expect that colliding black holes or neutron stars are going to return to their corners and collide again a few days later. Whatever is responsible for this series of bursts has to be an ongoing phenomenon.“In addition, the phenomenon has to be tremendously energetic. The radio flashes come from billions of light years away.It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common“Clearly, something in that galaxy can muster sufficient energy to produce a signal detectable here on Earth. And it can come up with that energy every few days or so.”Taken on its own, the FRB discovery might not have caused as much general interest as it did. But the news came alongside another announcement, and that concerned ‘Oumuamua.‘Oumuamua is actually the Hawaiian word for scout, or messenger, but it has that lovely science fictional ring to it. A common trope of science fiction is the idea of the Big Dumb Object –\u0026nbspa huge, unknowable, alien structure that appears in our skies or on Earth, a mute testimony to the existence of extraterrestrial life. Think the monoliths from Arthur C Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey or his novel Rendezvous with Rama, in which an enigmatic cylindrical object glides into our solar system.Clarke, who died in 2008, would have loved ‘Oumuamua. The name was coined by scientists at the University of Hawaii when they spotted the\u0026nbspstrange object passing through our system, not unlike Rama, in October 2017.‘Oumuamua was an asteroid –\u0026nbspor something similar –\u0026nbspan elongated lump of rock anything up to a kilometre long, and red in colour. It was notable in astronomical terms because it was the first time an object from outside our solar system was detected to be just passing through.There were the usual internet theories about it being something to do with aliens, of course, but they weren’t taken very seriously. Until October last year, when the chair of Harvard’s astronomy unit, Avi Loeb, went on the record to say, actually, this could be aliens, you know.Basing his statements on the observations that ‘Oumuamua appeared to accelerate at certain points during its passage past us, Loeb told German news magazine Der Spiegel that it “may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth’s vicinity by an alien civilisation”. He added: “If these beings are peaceful, we could learn a lot from them.”Scientists are generally a little wary about tossing around assertions that not only does alien life exist, but that\u0026nbspit has progressed to the point that it can disguise its spaceships as asteroids and send them spinning through the galaxy.Even Seti, which wears its heart on its sleeve when it comes to its mission to find alien life, has poured cold water on the repeating FRBs being of alien origin. Seth Shostak writes: “Aliens are frequently given the credit for causing new celestial phenomena. A half century ago, Soviet scientists suspected that quasars were actually signals broadcast by highly advanced societies far, far away. In the 1960s, British radio astronomers temporarily referred to pulsars as little green men.“But you can safely bet that aliens are not the cause of FRBs. Why? The bursters are seen all over the sky, that’s why. The same sort of signal is coming from galaxies that are generally separated by billions of light years. So how could aliens organise so much of the universe to engage in broadcasting the same sort of signal? There’s hardly been enough time since the Big Bang to coordinate such widespread teamwork, even if you can think of a reason for it!”This week The New Yorker magazine interviewed Loeb. He could reasonably have been expected to backtrack a little on his pronouncements from October regarding ‘Oumuamua. But not a bit of it. He went further, suggesting that ‘Oumuamua was some kind of solar-powered sail to account\u0026nbspfor its change in speeds, which you would not expect to see from a dead object simply drifting through space.Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universeLoeb told The New Yorker:\u0026nbsp“The only thing that came to my mind is that maybe the light from the sun, as it bounces off its surface, gives it an extra push. It’s just like a wind bouncing off a sail on a sailboat. So we checked that and found that you need the thickness of the object to be less than a millimetre in order for that to work. If it is indeed less than a millimetre thick, if it is pushed by the sunlight, then it is maybe a light sail, and I could not think of any natural process that would make a light sail. It is much more likely that it is being made by artificial means, by a technological civilisation.”But Loeb sounded a cautionary note for any ET fans out there. The civilisation that sent out ‘Oumuamua –\u0026nbspmuch in the same way we sent out the Voyager probes – could be long extinct, given the distances it might have travelled.But still, here’s a respected Harvard scientist saying that he believes in aliens: “I do not view the possibility of a technological civilisation as speculative, for two reasons. The first is that we exist. And the second is that at least a quarter of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy have a planet like Earth, with surface conditions that are very similar to Earth, and the chemistry of life as we know it could develop. If you roll the dice so many times, and there are tens of billions of stars in the Milky Way, it is quite likely we are not alone.”It’s the sort of thing people have been saying for years, but to hear it from such an august personage adds weight to the fact that belief in aliens is no longer confined to the tinfoil hat brigade.I punted out the question of whether aliens exist on social media. Perhaps it’s the sort of people who follow me, but nobody came out and said they didn’t believe in the existence of aliens. One reply on Twitter read: “Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universe.”Thinking exactly that seems to be ridiculed as much as the idea that there were aliens out there used to be not so long ago. One commenter called the idea “narcissistic” another said, “It would be bizarre to think we are the only life in the universe. Equally bizarre to believe that the universe is small enough for us ever to have the chance of meeting other life.”That last comment is perhaps indicative of the idea that while life might exist on other planets, we might never be able to get there, or vice versa.“Maybe not this year, but in the next five years,” asserts\u0026nbspauthor Rowan Coleman when I ask\u0026nbspon Facebook if 2019 is going to be a big year for aliens. “Nasa are sending probes to Europa and other moons with frozen water on them. There’s a lot of frozen water which is sometimes fluid on mars. Given that microbiotic life can survive on Earth in both freezing and boiling conditions, and in the vacuum of space, it seems pretty obvious we’d find this kind of life within our solar system.”Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemSatellite mistaken for meteorite crashes across sky above New ZealandNasa scientists plan to send a nuclear robot drill to hunt for aliensDo we really have a right to colonise Mars?David Darby adds:\u0026nbsp“My prediction is that everywhere you find liquid water you will find life – it has been shown to be the case on Earth no matter how extreme the environment. We may only discover microscopic unicellular life as this is the only life that can be expected within our universe. Interstellar travel times would mean that any galactic empire would probably remain undiscovered as our technology won’t get us there. Our planet has been here long enough for them to visit us if they had the technology or inclination. The fact that they haven’t would probably mean that interstellar travel is a technological problem with no solution. The one thing we can be sure of is that ‘the truth is out there’…”The idea of discovering microscopic life is one that has gained much more traction in recent years, and Coleman’s point about life on Earth surviving in extreme conditions is one that comedian Ben Miller made heavily in his recent book The Aliens Are Coming!Miller – who studied at Cambridge for a PhD in solid state physics –\u0026nbspis firmly of the belief that life is out there,\u0026nbspbut that we’re likely to find microbes before the silver spaceships come flying.He tells me about microbes that exist\u0026nbspin hot springs in Yellowstone National Park\u0026nbspin temperatures of 90C, about 30 degrees above what they should be able to withstand. If they can survive in those conditions here on Earth, why not on other planets?Are alien civilisations sending out repeating radio signals and solar-powered probes to investigate life on Earth? What used to be a belief that was cause for ridicule now seems to be much more widely accepted as not just true, but inevitable.Will we find life – whether microscopic bug\u0026nbspor galactic empire – in 2019? It feels, on recent evidence, that if we’re going to make contact, then this year, or the next, or maybe the next after that, seems increasingly likely.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.The impact on domestic manufacturers that mainly sell in the UK will depend on the share of the raw materials they import.Another likely problem for these domestic-focused importers is the pound. Most analysts expect a no-deal Brexit to result in another major fall in the value of sterling versus other currencies.How UK businesses are preparing for BrexitThis would push up their import costs. Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

They will talk to each other, of course, in between these scenes of mobile gazing, but their phones will lead the conversations and their screens will set the agendas.  A sign sums up three aspects of the modern British high street: despairing indifference from the bottom up against the status quo the rapid emergence of betting on the future and a simple message of family togetherness.Civilians look on in support of uniformed marchers – men, women and children – returning to the car park at the back of Iceland to finish the Armistice Day ceremony.A lady stops to read a sign of solidarity with victims of suicide in the UK.

Fairground rides are assembled at the end of the high street in preparation for the turning-on of the Christmas lights. In the process of construction, when all the parts aren’t put together and fully formed, the ride and the flag and the worker look pathetic and comical.

Engraved on the plinth is a message fitting for an English hell – “The Devil’s Den awaits the virtuous for conversion” – where the good are corrupted in the process of assimilation. Polish graffiti in support of the football team Legia Warsaw. I wonder about its intended audience. It can’t be for the non-Polish reading British majority, so it must be a territorial message for other Polish immigrants in the city.

A family leaving the Armistice Day ceremony. The father holds his hand out to his boys, asking for their bond and union, and the elder boy, not wanting to leave his younger brother behind and imitating his role model, repeats the gesture. A genuine, unstaged, unposed human moment on a day so well-rehearsed.A view of the Tinside Lido from the Hoe, deserted in late autumn, its pastel blue submerging into dirty water, darker than the sea, muddier than the hills. But it is still beautiful, not only geometrically with its lines and curves against the fluidity of the ocean, but also as an emblem of a British seaside culture slowly fading.An urban fox uses the public toilets at Bristol Temple Meads train station, adapted to human civilisation, more confident now, wine under arm, dressed up, ready for the Saturday night ahead. A distinctly 21st century image of friends hanging out. They will talk to each other, of course, in between these scenes of mobile gazing, but their phones will lead the conversations and their screens will set the agendas.  A sign sums up three aspects of the modern British high street: despairing indifference from the bottom up against the status quo the rapid emergence of betting on the future and a simple message of family togetherness.Civilians look on in support of uniformed marchers – men, women and children – returning to the car park at the back of Iceland to finish the Armistice Day ceremony.A lady stops to read a sign of solidarity with victims of suicide in the UK. The bearer of the sign completed a 32-minute silence to show her support for the 32 people who, on average, take their own lives in Britain every day.A counter-attack on the dominant Armistice Day narrative of peace. It’s a risky and rare question to ask the high street in a city so adherent to the story of sacrifice.

There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We\u0026nbspwill not gamble with peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation. This is why we insist on the backstop.”\u0026nbspMs May has promised to put forward a fresh plan for maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland by next Wednesday, but Mr Tusk warned that any new proposals from the UK must be “believeable”.\u0026nbspHe said: “Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend.\u0026nbspLive – EU council president says ‘we will not gamble with peace’“I hope the UK government will present ideas that will both respect this point of view and at the same time command a clear and stable majority in the House of Commons.”His stance was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said\u0026nbsphe was “open to further discussions” with the UK but that the current withdrawal agreement remained\u0026nbsp”the best deal possible”.He said: “While we expect that the backstop will never be used, we agreed again today that it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland while protecting the integrity of our European single market and customs union.“I think the events in London and the instability in British politics\u0026nbspin recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last.”After their joint press conference, microphones recorded Mr Varadkar joking to Mr Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.”A laughing Mr Tusk replied: “Yes I know.”The comments sparked a furious response from Brexiteers.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Mr Tusk has no manners, telling\u0026nbspthe BBC: “I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful.I\u0027m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u0027t done it.The DUP’s Sammy Wilson called Mr Tusk a\u0026nbsp”devilish, trident-wielding, euro maniac”, adding: “Donald Tusk once again shows his contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom. This devilish euro maniac is doing his best to keep the United Kingdom bound by the chains of EU bureaucracy and control.”Asked about the row, Ms May’s official spokesman said: “It’s a question for Donald Tusk whether he thinks using that language was appropriate.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the jobs go and revenues for services dry up as a result – Labour’s leadership will have zero right to complain: they share responsibility.”Brexit already hitting UK household finances due to higher pricesJeremy Corbyn writes to Theresa May outlining his five Brexit demands UK university applications rise for first time in three yearsEU ‘place in hell’ warning puts May’s Brexit rescue bid in troubleVerhofstadt says Brexiteers with no plan ‘would ide hell’Another MP, David Lammy, pointed to a leaked poll on Thursday which claimed Labour could lose an additional 45 seats if the party supports the implementation of Brexit – compared with 11 if it opposes Brexit.The document, according to the , added: “There can be no disguising the sense of disappointment and disillusionment with Labour if it fails to oppose Brexit and there is every indication that it will be far more damaging to the party’s electoral fortunes than the Iraq war.”Mr Lammy said: “Moral and economic arguments aside, failing to oppose Brexit would be a strategic error that would keep Labour out of power for a generation.”Included in Mr Corbyn’s five demands are close alignment with the single market, “unambiguous agreements” on future security arrangements, and “dynamic alignment” on rights and protections for UK workers.But one – a call for a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs unions” – is unlikely to receive Ms May’s backing given the sheer amount of opposition within the Conservative Party to such a move.UK university applications rise for first time in three yearsSignificantly, Mr Corbyn insisted the prime minister should have Labour’s priorities enshrined in the political declaration setting out future relations with the bloc, rather than the withdrawal agreement itself.The MP Phil Wilson – a supporter of the Peoples’s Vote campaign for a second public vote – added: “It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer.“Our party conference agreed last year that if it couldn’t get a general election it should explore other options including a new public vote.“The party and parliament should examine this option so that if and when it is rejected, Labour can fulfil the wishes of the overwhelming majority of its voters and members by campaigning to give the public the Final Say. In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour Party – a People’s Vote.”But speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the party’s shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner defended the shift in policy away from the six tests Labour originally set for a Brexit deal, saying the offer was made “in a spirit of co-operation and compromise”.“It’s not about tests now,” he said. “What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What she said already in Belfast: there’s no question to remove the backstop, because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, internal market, and peace process.Jeremy Corbyn writes to Theresa May outlining his five Brexit demands Labour last night called for a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union”, close alignment with the single market underpinned by “shared institutions”, protections on workers rights, and UK participation in some EU agencies. The policy moves the party closer to a so-called “Norway+” Brexit that would keep the UK in the blocs orbit, though technically outside.In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month.The two negotiating teams have been formally stood down since the withdrawal agreement was agreed between the two sides last year, with the EU saying it did not anticipate any further meetings. But with MPs in Westminster blocking the ratification of the agreement, officials will begin meeting again.A joint statement by the Commission and the UK government following the first meeting with Mr Juncker on Thursday said the gathering was “held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU”.Theresa May is said to have explained the situation in Westminster to Mr Juncker and raised “various options for dealing with these concerns”.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentBut Mr Juncker responded by underlining that the EU27 would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – describing it as ”a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal”.He however “expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK”, according to the read-out of the meeting.The statement concluded: “The discussion was robust but constructive.

The Prime Minister and the President will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.”Ms May’s meeting Mr Tusk comes a day after he caused a row by warning that there was a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without even a basic plan for how to actually enact it. Speaking after her meeting she said: I’ve raised with president Tusk the language that he used yesterday which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the UK.\u0026nbspThe point I made to him is that we should both be working to ensure we should deliver a close relationship between the UK and EU in the future and that’s what he should be focusing on.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

Another key takeaway is they are planning to meet at the end of February, which is dangerously close to exit day on March 29. Are we getting closer to a delay?Read it in full below:Prime Minister May and President Juncker have met today to review the next steps in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.The talks were held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU, especially in the context of a shared determination to achieve a strong partnership for the future given the global challenges the EU and the UK face together in upholding open and fair trade, cooperation in the fight against climate change and terrorism and defending the rules-based international system.The Prime Minister described the context in the UK Parliament, and the motivation behind last week’s vote in the House of Commons seeking a legally binding change to the terms of the backstop. She raised various options for dealing with these concerns in the context of the Withdrawal Agreement in line with her commitments to the Parliament.President Juncker underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, which represents a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal. President Juncker however expressed his openness to add wording to the Political Declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK. President Juncker drew attention to the fact that any solution would have to be agreed by the European Parliament and the EU27.The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The Prime Minister and the President will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.Downing Street confirmed that Jeremy\u0026nbspCorbyn\u0027s letter had been received, and a spokeswoman added: We will reply in due course. Our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. Our position on the backstop has not changed.The spokeswoman said that no further meeting between Mrs May and the Labour leader to discuss Brexit had been scheduled, but added that her door is open.Andrea Leadsom\u0026nbspconfirms there will be a debate on Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit deal on Thursday, February 14.The PM will bring a \u0027revised deal\u0027 back to the House for a second meaningful vote \u0027as soon as she can\u0027. If that\u0027s not possible by Feb 13, the government will table an amendable motion on Thursday.\u0026nbspThis comes off the back of a story in the Huffington Post, which revealed roaming charges could be brought overnight for Brits abroad in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspLiam Fox has warned MPs risk making the pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit more likely by voting against the Government\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement.The international trade secretary, asked about processing trade deals with minimal delays, told the Commons: In terms of the continuity of agreements we already have, the best way to ensure full continuity is to have a deal.All those who talk about the pitfalls of no deal would do well to remember that in voting against a deal they make those pitfalls all the more likely.Labour accused Dr Fox of giving away the shop before negotiations start after reports he is planning on scrapping all import tariffs post-Brexit.The cabinet minister replied: The government has made no decision on this, when we do so we will communicate it to stakeholders, the public and Parliament.Of course the best way to avoid this scenario is to have a deal with the European Union and whipping up fear about people\u0027s jobs is simply the humbug that has become the hallmark of Mr Esterson.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The first that person will know about it is when someone bangs on their door in the early hours of the morning to bundle them into an immigration enforcement van and take them to a detention centre.“Those we get to hear about are probably only the tip of the iceberg, but we do know that £21m was paid out by the Home Office in just five years to compensate for wrongful detention, and terrible mistakes are certainly what happened in the Windrush cases.”The committee said it had looked at the Home Office files of Windrush citizens who had been unable to prove their UK residence, and that there was “masses” of evidence, including records of national insurance contributions going back decades.Algerian man dies in London immigration detention centreGovernment plans risk ‘riding roughshod’ over rights of immigrantsSuicides in immigration removal centres kept ‘state secret’, MPs told“If there had been any independence in the decision making, these people would never have been detained, yet they were detained not once but twice. The papers in their files were ignored, and the pleas of their families were swept aside,” Ms Harman added.“After the right to life, the right not to be unlawfully detained is one of the most important human rights. It should not be the case that a person has fewer protections from wrongful detention as an immigrant than they would if they had actually committed a crime.”The MPs also said detainees should have better and more consistent access to legal aid to challenge their detention, and that a reinstatement of legal aid for immigration cases should be considered.Sam Grant, policy and campaigns manager for Liberty, supported the calls, describing indefinite detention as an “ineffective and inefficient waste of money and human life”.\u0026nbspBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, also backed the calls, saying\u0026nbspa 28-day time limit was “urgently” needed along with early judicial oversight and safeguards against “cat and mouse” re-detentions.“The JCHR has expertly laid bare the injustice and abuse inherent in our current system. Parliament will have the opportunity to take this historic step when it considers the immigration bill and we urge MPs of all parties to take it,” she added.UN backs calls for time limit on UK immigration detentionLeila Zadeh, executive director of UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group, welcomed the report but called for the government to bring an end to the detention of LGBT+ people, saying it was “wholly inappropriate”“They run a significant risk of being locked up among other people who may display the same discriminatory attitudes and hostility from which they have fled. They also frequently struggle to be granted refugee status if they have to make their asylum applications from inside a detention centre,” she added.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp “Immigration detention is an important part of the wider immigration system, but we are committed to usingdetention sparingly and only when necessary. Ninety-five per cent of people liable for removal at any one time are managed in the community.“Any decision to detain someone is reviewed by a Detention Gatekeeper who acts independently from referring and case working teams to ensure an inidual’s suitability for detention has been fully assessed, and any vulnerabilities have been considered.“An inidual is only detained when there is realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale. We do not detain people indefinitely, and the law does not allow it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereAsylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She asserts this amongst continued attacks on her approach to Brexit by Boris Johnson and the European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees MoggQuite the blow was dealt to the Prime Minister at a EU leaders summit in Salzburg on September 20. European Council President Donald Tusk stated that the Chequers deal will not workFollowing the rejection of her Chequers plan the day before, the Prime Minister voiced her anger that the EU had dismissed it without offering an alternative. She stated that “throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.As the People\u0027s Vote campaign and The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign gain traction, 700,000 people turn out in London to demand a final say on the UK\u0027s Brexit deal on October 20 2018As the Prime Minister settles on a Brexit deal, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab resigns along with Work and Pensions secretary Esther McVey and many other ministers3542 Final Say petitions delivered to Downing StreetPeople\u0027s Vote supporting MPs Chukka Umunna, Justine Greening and Caroline Lucas and The Independent editor Christian Broughton deliver over a million signatures in favour of a People\u0027s Vote to the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street on December 3 2018On December 10, the Prime Minister delayed the vote on her Brexit deal as it was near certain not to pass through the Commons due to Tory rebels and lack of DUP supportTory MPs triggered a confidence vote in the Prime Minister on December 12.

In the same sitting, MPs also voted against a no-deal Brexit in a non-legally binding motion4142 EU council president savages Brexit campaigners who failed to plan for departure: ‘Special place in hell’There is a “special place in hell” for pro-Brexit campaigners who demanded Britain leave the EU without explaining how it should happen, Donald Tusk has said. The European Council president launched the scathing attack as he accused anti-EU campaigners of pushing for Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” Mr Tusk also dismissed suggestions that the EU could reopen negotiations over the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, dealing a blow to Theresa May‘s hopes of securing fresh concessions as she tries to get her exit deal through parliament. Speaking in Brussels alongside Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Tusk said: “I’ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” He also tweeted the accusation moments later4242 EU and UK announce talks to restart after Theresa May visits BrusselsBoth have agreed to restart Brexit talks to find “a way through” the deadlock in Westminster, following a visit by Theresa May to Brussels. In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month. But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadHe states: “This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tariff and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals.“We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.”The letter comes as Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said there was a “special place in hell” for politicians who had sold the idea of Brexit without thinking through the consequences.Downing Street hit back angrily as a range of politicians all spoke about against Mr Tusk’s comments.The president of the European Council did however repeat the EU position that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, echoed the message in a joint statement with Leo Varadkar, saying: “We cannot accept the idea, which is circulating around, that the withdrawal agreement could be reopened.”Ms May will be meeting with European leaders in the coming days to discuss the withdrawal agreement and in his\u0026nbspletter\u0026nbspMr Corbyn said he understood that any negotiation would require “flexibility and compromise”.Despite the EU’s position of not reopening the negotiations, Mr Corbyn’s letter called on Ms May to secure a number of changes.“Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK,” the letter says.Labour also want a close alignment with the single market “underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, with clear arrangements for dispute resolution” as well participation in EU agencies and funding programmes. However it notably drops Labour’s previous demand to secure the\u0026nbsp”exact same benefits” of the single market.There are also calls for “unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases”.Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

who was third in line to the throne in  - is now sixth in line.Since the news broke that the Duke and Duchess of Sussexare expecting a child in spring , he or she will take the seventh place in the queue, bumping Prince Andrew, the Duke of York down to eighth place and Princess Beatrice and Eugenie down to ninth and tenth respectively.But who was dropped from the top ten Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, lost his top ten seat. The rules of Royal succession have changed signicantly in recent years.Leaders of  British Commonwealth countriesvoted in  to alter the centuries-old tradition to include daughters as well as sons.Previously daughters could only inherit the thronethere were no living sons.This system, which dated back  years, is based on the rules of primogeniture which gives preference to the firstborn male heirs of a king or queen.This change in royal succession means Princess Charlotte, as William and Kates daughter, is ahead of her younger brother.Previouslythe third child was male he would leap the princess in the line of succession.This new rule only takes into account children born after , meaning Prince Edwards youngest child, James, born in , is ahead of his older sister, Louise, born in .Commonwealth leaders also decided in  to remove the rule that no heir could assume the thronehe or she married a Roman Catholic.Then Prime Minister David Cameron said at the time: “The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man just isn’t acceptable anymore.Nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic.“The thinking behind these rules is wrong.The Roman Catholic rule can be traced to the th-century reign of Henry VIII.The King broke with the Roman Catholic Church to orce his we, Queen Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn.The changes, under the Succession to the Crown Act , came into force in March  but apply to people born after October , .Live Science reported that because one of the duties of the British monarch is to head the Church of England, no Roman Catholic can hold the crown.The basis for the succession was determined in the th century.When James II fled the country in , Parliament held that he had abdicated the government and that the throne was vacant.The throne was then offered, not to Jamess young son, but to his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, as joint rulers, following the Glorious Revolution.At -years-old, Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in UK history - having been first in line from the age of three - and would become the oldest ever British monarch to take the throne.Some royalists have argued that Prince Charles should step aside to allow Prince William to become King because he enjoys better approval ratings with the public based on a poll last year.Prince Charles has faced controversy over his orce from Princess Diana and his affair during their marriage with now-we Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.He has also been accused of “meddling” in politics by stating his opinion on issues like the environment and farming, alternative medicine and architecture in private letters to Government ministers.In , Edward VIII - the Queens uncle - famously abdicated after less than a year on the throne so he could marry orcee Wallis Simpson.Prince Harry says no Royal wants to be King or Queen — but they would do it for “the greater good”.The -year-old said: “Is there any one of the Royal Family who wants to be king or queen I don’t think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.”He told Newsweek magazine: “We are involved in modernising the British monarchy.We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people.”And he insisted the Royals were still vital, adding: “We don’t want to dilute the magic.“The British public and the whole world need institutions like it.”The long-serving royal has stepped back from a public role after  years of royal duties.His final solo engagement was The Captain General’s Parade in August , when he saluted the Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace.Due to English common laws, he cannot become king.The we of a king is known as a Queen Consort, and takes the title of Queen – although she doesn’t rule as the monarch.Buta female royal marries a man with a title below her own - as in the case of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip - she will retain the title while her husband will not be entitled to it.He is known as Prince Consort.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do they not want Britain to succeed Do they not see that their bizarre, condescending attitude is EXACTLY why they lost in  THE rocketing suicide rate amongst teenagers is nothing short of a national crisis.And the solution MUST involve the social media firms who are profiting from youngsters’ suffering.They have been given quite enough warning that they are not doing enough to protect vulnerable kids.They have said for years that they just need a bit more time, and that they’d fix the problem themselves.Well, they’ve failed.Government has no choice but to step in – and it needs a concerted effort from the Education, Health and Culture Departments.One more tragic death is one too many.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the wild exaggerations of Project Fear II about No Deal anarchy.It’s the Remainer MPs who voted to trigger Article , then lied to voters about respecting the referendum result even as they plotted to reverse it.It’s the brass-necked Tory MP who claimed “Brexiteers were lying when they said Nissan was going nowhere” — long after it was clear the war on diesel was really to blame for the U-turn on the new model in Sunderland.Next to all that, an over-optimistic prediction or two and a slightly inaccurate bus slogan look small beer.Lies  Remain ultras should look in the mirror.TO Corbyn’s disgust, the Government has recognised a new leader in Venezuela instead of the hard-left loon Maduro who has let millions starve.What’s Jezza’s alternative  Do nothing. Leave them to whatever grim fate awaits.Why  Because any Western intervention, even the aid they now desperately need, will prove that his lelong ideology has failed catastrophically.

They must not be allowed to dodge blame by rewriting their own.WHAT possessed Tory chairman Brandon Lewis to hound a woman over a porn snap she allegedly “liked” on Twitter His every focus should be on raising funds and attracting new blood to a party whose flagging membership has an average age in the late s.Instead he foolishly thinks there’s political advantage in shaming a Labour candidate over a smutty pic. Who cares Lewis has come a cropper before with hasty tweets. Like his demand for fellow Tory Boris Johnson to apologise over burka remarks most of Britain backed.But he’s just one of too many MPs who waste endless hours on Twitter, reducing politics to vacuous virtue-signalling or spiteful, tribal, juvenile point-scoring.No wonder voters are sick of them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.’“He writes her a really long letter in , and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her.“She feels like, ‘That’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said ’“It’s almost like they’re ships passing.“He knows how to get in touch with her.“It’s super-painful because Meg was always so dutul.“I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done. At the same time, because she’s a daughter, she has a lot of sympathy for him.”The close friends spoke anonymously to US magazine People after Thomas made a string of public outbursts about his royal daughter and Meghan’s half-sister Samantha cashed in on their “non-existent” relationship.The Sun understands the pals spoke to People with Meghan’s approval, and that her press team at Kensington Palace were kept in the dark.One friend said: “Meg has sat silently back and endured the lies and untruths.“We want to stand up against the global bullying we are seeing and speak the truth about who our friend, a  mother-to-be, really is.“We worry about what this is doing to her and the baby. It’s wrong to put anyone under this level of emotional trauma, let alone when they’re pregnant.”The pals vehemently defend the Duchess and reveal she was devastated by her father’s response to her letter and did not talk to him after that.They also claim that:They said Thomas’s older children, Thomas Markle Junior and Samantha Grant, “were in their mid-to-late teens when  Meghan was born” and “were not a part of her le”.The friend added: “They’ve been made to appear as siblings who were very close and then they had this falling out, and that’s not the truth at all.“Fast-forward to Meghan dating Harry and now Samantha isname Markle. And then she began this career capitalising on Meg.“Everyone who knows Meg knows the two of them have no relationship.”The same friend also gave Meghan’s side of the story, after her dad Thomas pulled out of walking her down the aisle at the royal wedding due to a heart attack.They told the magazine Meghan had looked after her father financially, despite what  Samantha had claimed.They said: “Meghan’s been a rock for everyone in her family.“It’s a shame that it’s being painted in this other light that is just absolutely .“She took care of her father with such incredible generosity.“The fact that this could be flipped around, that she was acting out or not caring for him, is preposterous.“The Saturday before the wedding, she and Harry were told that a story was going to come out the next day saying that Tom was staging pictures with the paparazzi.“Their team told them thatthe story was fake, they could file a complaint.“So Meg calls Tom and asks him, and he’s swearing up and down that it’s not true. The next day the pictures come out.“Even with all that, Meg and Harry were still so focused on getting him to London.“At no point was there talk of, ‘Now that we know he lied, he’s in trouble’.“Tom wouldn’t take her calls, wouldn’t take Harry’s calls. The next morning when the car got there , he wouldn’t get in.“ Meg heard he’d had a heart attack and she’s calling him and texting him, even up to the night before the wedding.“It was like, ‘Please pick up. I love you, and I’m scared.’ It was endless.”Another friend revealed how spiritual Meghan was, saying she meditates and “really lives in the current moment”.They also reveal that the Duchess does all her own make-up, dresses and styles herself and writes her own speeches for herself and Harry.Former actress Meghan has been accused of intimidating staff with am emails and a “demanding manner”.But one of her former colleagues on US TV drama Suits said: “The email thing is such a weird slant on someone who is actually an incredibly organized, diligent, focused, hard-working person.“She was always that way.“She showed up on set more prepared than anyone .”Meghan was also praised for providing hand-warmers for Palace guards standing in the cold weather and for laying on an ice-cream and sorbet stand for her staff.Kensington Palace refused to comment.NOVEMBER , : Meghan and Harry announce  engagement but he admits he hasn’t met her dad Thomas.DECEMBER :   Thomas  tells reporters he’d “love to” walk his daughter down the aisle.MAY , :  Kensington Palace  says Thomas will be giving his daughter away.MAY : It’s revealed he took cash, allegedly £,,  for staged paparazzi pictures.MAY : He pulls out of the wedding for health reasons.MAY : The royal wedding.JUNE :   Thomas appears on Good Morning Britain to say the photos were a “mistake”.JULY : He gives a newspaper interview claiming his daughter would be “nothing without me”.AUGUST :   He reveals he once slammed the phone down on  Harry during a heated call over the snaps.OCTOBER :  The royal couple announce they’re expecting baby in  the spring.OCTOBER :    Thomas says he heard about his grandchild on the car radio.NOVEMBER  DECEMBER:   He gives more damaging   interviews, saying things like he hopes to meet the baby one day despite Meghan “ghosting” him since her wedding.JANUARY , :  He  tells The Sun  he is writing a tell-all book about his daughter.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stop the PR crap.The American - who said Meghan had lie-abetes also shared a message, saying: When a narcissist has lost control over you, they try to control how others see you.She then added: Andthe narcissist is wealthy they pay very expensive PR teams to change the way people see you.The -year-old also hit out at Meghans friends speaking anonymously, saying: Sources say means imaginary sources.Samanthas attack comes after five pals of Meghan spoke with People yesterday, saying: We want to stand up against the global bullying we are seeing and speak the truth about who our friend, a  mother-to-be, really is.We worry about what this is doing to her and the baby. It’s wrong to put anyone under this level of emotional trauma, let alone when they’re pregnant.The pals vehemently defend the Duchess and reveal she was devastated by her father’s response to her letter and did not talk to him after that.They also claim that:One of the Duchess’s long-time friends was scathing about her family.They said Thomas’s older children, Thomas Markle Junior and Samantha Grant, “were in their mid-to-late teens when  Meghan was born” and “were not a part of her le”.The friend added: “They’ve been made to appear as siblings who were very close and then they had this falling out, and that’s not the truth at all.“Fast-forward to Meghan dating Harry and now Samantha isname Markle.

I don’t think I remember Jesus saying hey just dump your whole family, it’s the posh thing to do you know, cause you’re better than them Nice try.But the same friend also gave Meghan’s side of the story, after her dad Thomas pulled out of walking her down the aisle at the royal wedding due to a heart attack.They told the magazine Meghan had looked after her father financially, despite what  Samantha had claimed.They said: “Meghan’s been a rock for everyone in her family.“It’s a shame that it’s being painted in this other light that is just absolutely .“She took care of her father with such incredible generosity.“The fact that this could be flipped around, that she was acting out or not caring for him, is preposterous.“The Saturday before the wedding, she and Harry were told that a story was going to come out the next day saying that Tom was staging pictures with the paparazzi.“Their team told them thatthe story was fake, they could file a complaint.“So Meg calls Tom and asks him, and he’s swearing up and down that it’s not true. The next day the pictures come out.“Even with all that, Meg and Harry were still so focused on getting him to London.“At no point was there talk of, ‘Now that we know he lied, he’s in trouble’.“Tom wouldn’t take her calls, wouldn’t take Harry’s calls.

I love you, and I’m scared.’ It was endless.”Another friend revealed how spiritual Meghan was, saying she meditates and “really lives in the current moment”.They also reveal that the Duchess does all her own make-up, dresses and styles herself and writes her own speeches for herself and Harry.Former actress Meghan has been accused of intimidating staff with am emails and a “demanding manner”.But one of her former colleagues on US TV drama Suits said: “The email thing is such a weird slant on someone who is actually an incredibly organized, diligent, focused, hard-working person.“She was always that way.“She showed up on set more prepared than anyone .”Meghan was also praised for providing hand-warmers for Palace guards standing in the cold weather and for laying on an ice-cream and sorbet stand for her staff.Kensington Palace refused to comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000467135177.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cafe supervisor branded uks worst boss after telling job reject all brits are lazy","story":"Job applicant Victoria Atkins, , was offered a trial sht at Intenso Espresso in Hove, East Sussex, last Sunday following a successful interview.But when she was two hours late due to bad weather, Victoria messaged the cafe to askher sht could be rearranged.She then received a barrage of rude and nasty messages from cafe supervisor Jullian Preston-Powers, lamenting her no-show and launching a tirade of abuse against working Brits.Victoria said she was very, very offended by the anti-British sentiment of the supervisor, who is married to the cafe owner.Jullian also told her staff cannot take sick days and will lose their paythey do, before bizarrely claiming workers dont get illthey are thin and avoid eating bacon.Shockingly when approached for comment, Jullian defended his views saying the very poorest type of employee is a British one.Victoria, from Brighton, East Sussex, said she felt disgusted by Jullians response.She said: I understand why he didnt let me just do another sht, but his comments about British people having no work ethic were shocking.In his message, Jullian wrote: Its probably better you did not succeed in getting the job because you can never be late for or miss work at our business. Ever.You cannot ever even call in sick as that is not allowed.We are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics.Following the row, Jullian has stood by his views, claiming that the work ethic of Brits are inferior to those from Eastern Europe.Jullian said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop.The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British.He added that Brits take advantage of the fact they have a benefit system and theyre not motivated to earn money.Jullian said his business has been hit with floods of bad reviews online from angry Brits after Victoria posted screenshots of their conversation on Facebook.A TUC spokesperson said: “If he’s looking for the title of Britain’s Worst Boss, it sounds like he’s going about it the right way.“It’s illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity. And profiteering from staff illness by docking their wages is very likely illegal too.“Britain’s workers have a very strong work ethic.

When it comes to the future relations, we can have a look into alternative arrangements. But they can never replace the backstop.“We are sticking to the line that we set on Day One.”But Mr Varadkar held out hope for other changes when he revealed he had invited Mrs May to Dublin for Brexit talks over dinner on Friday evening.No last night played down the prospect of getting a breakthrough in time to put to MPs in next Thursday’s Commons votes.A senior Downing Street source said: “If the clouds clear then great, but realistically it’s not where we’re going.”The source added that the Government would have to put “something” down to vote on next Thursday but said he expects the “focus” will be on other amendments such as attempts to legislate against a no deal Brexit.Abandoning the new plan to instead fight for a time limit or exit mechanism to the current backstop instead risks infuriating arch Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group of hardline MPs.They insisted on Wednesday that the PM must demand the EU accept the unity plan or face a new Commons defeat next week.There is “a very slim chance” of Mrs May winning the next crucial Commons vote on February she doesn’t, a senior ERG figure said.But government whips now think they could whittle down the ERG’s rebellion to around  diehardsthe PM does win other legally binding changes.And up to  Labour MPs will back the PM’s Brexit dealshe allows Parliament a say in trade talks – ex-Shadow Minister Lisa Nandy declared yesterday.She said a commitment that Parliament could help “frame” Britain’s post Brexit direction after March  could be enough to get a huge number of opposition MPs over the line.Brits going from the mainland to Northern Ireland may need to have their passports stamped under the current Brexit deal, it also emerged.Expert analysis of the agreement struck in November carried out for Tory Eurosceptics has revealed the legal obligation on UK authorities would kick inthe unpopular Irish backstop is enforced.The revelation flies in the face of the PM’s promise to never ide up the UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said MPs had been asked to sit beyond midnight on several occasions recently.Labour’s Diana Johnson said the situation was “bang out of order”, writing on Twitter: “Considering Brexit is just  days away this is totally irresponsible!”SNP chief whip Patrick Gray said: “Seemingly the Tory Government thinks there’s nothing worth debating or discussing.”Labour MP Verendra Sharma from the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain stormed: “This is not on. Parliament still has tons of legislation to get through before the end of March, including thousands of pages of statutory instruments.“Brexit is the most important legislative and political process since the Second World War. It makes no sense to go home and avoid working on ensuring the country’s future when there’s so little time left.”With  days to go, the Government is running out of time to pass the necessary legislation needed to implement Brexit.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

That was the message The Daily Mirror learned on a visit to a breakfast club for rough sleepers this week. Never more was this in evidence then -year-old Richard. Once a respected news reporter on a local paper it seemed he had the world at his feet. But like so many homeless people a relationship breakdown led him to ruin and he has never quite recovered. He has lived on and off the streets ever since. He said: “People are a tissue thin slice away from disaster, they just don’t think about it.” Richard, who along with others in this article did not wish to give his full name, was just one of many vulnerable adults and young people who wandered in and out of the breakfast club organised by independent homeless charity Encompass Southwest, based in Barnstaple, Devon.  The charity has gone from a tiny soup kitchen in  to employing  full and part-time members of staff who provide a range of service to tough sleepers in North Devon from advice, to support services and housing. One of the many services Encompass offer rough sleepers is a popular breakfast club every Tuesday morning in the spare room of a local radio station. Manned by staff and volunteers at least  rough sleepers came and went from am until noon all with ying stories to tell but all just thankful for a warm breakfast. The age range was shocking, the youngest was  and the eldest , from a wide iety of walks of le. Frightened Will, , revealed he was kicked out of his house by his parents and has slept rough for five months. He says there are lots of people who try to take advantage of him so admitted he has carried a weapon in the past to feel safe. He said: “It’s a nightmare out there, people will abuse youthey can so you have to be wary, I’m just focusing on getting out of this situation the best way I can.”  Gavin, , said he used to be able earn as much pound a day when he ran his own tiling business but a relationship break-up saw him lose everything. He now sleeps in a park which he describes as “scary”. He said people need to understand that “homelessness can happen to anyone, at anytime.” Amongst the many cheerful volunteers was humble AE nurse Sarah Gabe, . She volunteers at the breakfast club every week and admitted it took some time to win the rough sleeper’s trust but now she can use of her medical skills to treat them directly.  She said: “It took about six months for them to trust me to the point where they now come to me with problems. “It is mainly simple things like foot care and listening to their chests but when you are sleeping rough small things can become big problems so it is great that I can see them directly and help them where I can.”  One rough sleeper at the breakfast club who has definitely benefited from Encompass’s hands-on approach is -year-old Paul. Originally from London he explained he drted out to Devon because it was “safer” but a mixture of drink and drug problems have kept him on the streets ever since. He is what homelessness experts describe as ‘entrenched’ and in years gone by may never have got the help he required and could easily have died on the streets. But Encompass have adopted a new scheme called Housing First which started in the USA in the s and has since spread to Europe. The idea behind the approach is to give entrenched rough sleepers like Paul some control over where they live and how rather then assigning them places to live under strict rules and regulations. The British Government has recently invested poundm in Housing First pilot projects across the country. While Encompass have not received any of that money they have copied the approach and slowly persuaded Paul to live in his own flat after years on the streets. According to his Encompass support worker like Becky Fausset, , who has been working with rough sleepers for over  years, Paul’s new flat could very well be the dference between le and death. She said: “These are people that another winter and they could be dead and that is not being dramatic, so being able to get them into accommodation is very rewarding. “Housing First is dficult but incredibly positive, the dficulty is finding the properties, but so far it seems to be working. “People come to pretty places like Barnstaple and North Devon and don’t realise what is really going on and how many people are really struggling.” Paul finally moved in this week but when The Mirror visited the flat with him on Monday for the first time he was overwhelmed.  He said: “I can’t believe it, I feel like a real person again, someone that’s worth something, this is everything and I’m not going to let it go.” According to the latest research from the respected IPPR think-tank there was  per cent rise in rough sleeping in rural areas from  in  to  in . Butyou speak to people working on the front line of this problem they will tell you privately the true figures are likely to be much higher because the issue is so dficult to record. The Daily Mirror spent two days there with the dedicated staff of one homeless charity this week in a bid to highlight this worrying trend. We were hosted by the indomitable Claire Fisher, the CEO of Encompass.  Fighting her own personal battle against cancer Claire thinks nothing of manning the front lines each day and can be seen walking the streets and dishing out food to rough sleepers with her fellow colleagues. She explained how people could not believe areas like North Devon even had a homeless problem associating it with sunny holidays and second homes.  She said: “Believe it or not this is considered a deprived area round here which is really dficult to comprehend when you think of the beaches and the summer holidays but people are missing the reality of what le is like for people who live here year round. “We have a perfect storm here of a lack of industry, low paying jobs, zero hour contracts and a very low stock of social housing meaning people cannot afford to buy. “House prices are four times the average wage down here so they are reliant on the private rented sector and that is not always reliable.” She also pointed out how some rough sleepers actively choose to live in the countryside leaving them invisible to outside support. She said: “We do have people that choose to rough sleep in rural areas, purely because it is quieter, the risks are lower and they are not as open to abuse. Some of them can be very self sufficient. “I think a lot of the resources are focused on cities because it so visual there butyou come down here on holiday you don’t see it as much but actually we really have high numbers here and then others we are not aware of – we rely heavily on people like the Forestry Commission and farmers for tips about where people have set-up shop. “People need to realise that rural homelessness is happening, you may not see it, but it is all around you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit corbyn offers help theresa","story":"NewsBrexit: Corbyn offers to help Theresa May PASS a deal - whats changed and why MPs are furiousJeremy Corbyn has written a bombshell letter to Theresa May offering a way to make Brexit happen.

In a bombshell letter  days before Brexit, the Labour leader has shted his red lines and offered Theresa May a clear way to leave the EU -she backs a full customs union. It meansshe accepts his demands, Mrs May can get a House of Commons majority for Brexit. But firstly, thats a huge  that could split the Tories. Secondly, it throws a huge spanner in the works hours before the Prime Minister meets EU chiefs in Brussels today. And thirdly, its enraged some Labour MPs who want Jeremy Corbyn to stop helping the government push through Brexit - and back a second EU referendum instead. All that means its a long shot, and probably wont happen. But its still an important intervention in Brexit. So what is new today, how has Labour changed its position, and why are Remainer MPs angry  Heres our guide - and the letter in full.  Labours leader has written a letter to Theresa May, saying he WILL back her on a Brexit dealit meets five demands:A permanent, UK-wide customs union with the EU Close alignment with the EU single market Dynamic alignment on rights and protections, so UK standards keep pace with new ones in the EU Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies Unambiguous agreements on future securityMr Corbyn has already held talks with the Prime Minister and more are expected to follow. He promises to discuss his proposal with her in a constructive way to secure a sensible agreement. He says compromise is now needed to please both the EU and the House of Commons, which voted down the -page Brexit deal by a record majority last month.  Labour already backed a customs union. But this change in tactics is vital. Firstly, the letter means Labour has officially ditched its six tests a Brexit deal would have to meet before being backed. The tests were unveiled in March . They were based partly on Tory promises about Brexit, but included ambitions that were obviously impossible - such as securing the exact same benefits the UK currently has. They were derided as bollocks by Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner. Today the very same Mr Gardiner told the BBC: Its not about tests now. What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons. Secondly, it means Labour is putting calls for a second EU referendum firmly on the back burner - despite huge pressure within the party. Labour pledged to keep a second EU referendum as an option on the table thanks to a motion at the party conference last year. Remainers say Labour should campaigning for that public vote NOW, having failed to force a general election. But Jeremy Corbyn is against it. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer was forced to intervene after a backlash, insisting the Labour leaders letter did not take the prospect of a public vote off the table. Thirdly, there is no mention in the letter of delaying Brexit. Labour has said extending the March  date may be inevitable. But this shows the party is still striving to help get a soft Brexit through as soon as it can. Why are some Labour MPs furious   Labour Remain-backers have voiced their fury at Jeremy Corbyn for - in their words - enabling Brexit. They want him to back a second EU referendum instead. And the words of Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner, who quoted Theresa May herself, wont help. He said: Jeremy is trying to set out what we believe is needed to make a success of Brexit. Labour MP Chuka Umunna blasted: This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer. Labour MP Owen Smith said he was considering quitting the Labour Party.   Fellow Remainer MP Chris Leslie said: “Seriously  Offering to help Tory Govt enable Brexit  It’s not just Labour’s conference policy in the bin. When the jobs go  revenues for services dry up as a result, Labour’s leadership will have ZERO right to complain: they share responsibility.” Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi wrote sarcastically: Nice to be briefed about this @UKLabour @WelshLabour. If at ANY point you would like to consult MPs and also take the Labour Party conference motion into consideration... Just let me know... Cheers...  For the first time, it means Theresa May doesnt need to change the backstop - or appease Tory Brexiteers - to get her deal through. The backstop is an insurance clause that would trap the UK under EU customs rules from , in exchange for keeping the Irish border open. The Prime Minister is meeting EU chiefs in Brussels today to try and tweak the clause. Shes done that because Tory Brexiteers said otherwise, theres no way they would pass the Brexit deal. Yet EU chiefs say they wont change the backstop, leaving talks deadlocked. Now Labour claims it has a way out by offering that permanent customs union - arranged, crucially, through the future framework and not the -page exit deal that contains the backstop. If she backs it, Labour claims, Theresa May wont need Tory Brexiteer help to get a Commons majority. Barry Gardiner said: What were saying is actually you can do this another way. What you can do is say lets look at the future political framework, andthe future political framework were agreed now between the EU and ourselves to be a customs union, then actually theres no problem at that point when you get to the end of the transition period, because youre already in a customs union and therefore you dont need the backstop.  Theresa May has made clear she wants to be able to strike trade deals around the world. If the UK is in a full customs union with the EU, she cant do that. And Labour proposed a customs union before - only to be defeated in the House of Commons. Evenshe did fold and accept a customs union, the row over it could split Theresa Mays party for good. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg once warned of a revolt the size of that over the Victorian-era Corn Laws. There is one important upshot though. If Theresa May refuses Jeremy Corbyns offer, he can reasonably pin the blame on herit leads to a No Deal Brexit.  A No spokeswoman said: The letter has been received and we will reply in due course. Many of our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. The PMs focus is on securing changes to the backstop. Thats what she is focused on today. But a No spokeswoman repeatedly declined to say Theresa May will put any specic proposals to EU leaders today to solve the deadlock. She said: She will be discussing the ongoing urgent work we have been undertaking since the vote to secure the changes that mean we can secure parliamentary support. She added: You know our position on the customs union and that has not changed. No new meetings with Corbyn were confirmed as of am but Mrs Mays door remains open. What happens next   Theresa May is meeting EU chiefs including Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels today. Theyre likely to brush her off, a day after saying Tory Brexiteers who had no plan have a special place in hell. Then shes travelling to Dublin on Friday night for dinner with Irish premier Leo Varadkar. Hes likely to brush her off too. But in between and afterwards, theres a window for talks with Jeremy Corbyn and his top team about the offer. David Lidington, her de facto deputy, said there would be a channel open to Labour. Shes unlikely to have a new deal ready by next week, meaning MPs will get a vote directing the way forward on February . That could bind her hands, delay Brexit, or just leave us in more deadlock as time ticks down to March .  Dear Prime Minister, Thank you for taking the time to meet last week to discuss the Brexit negotiation and our alternative approaches to finding a deal that can command support in Parliament and be negotiated with the EU. There is, as was demonstrated last week, a clear majority in Parliament that no deal must now be taken off the table and that there can be noto a hard border in Northern Ireland in any circumstance. We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the Withdrawal Agreement, as we discussed when we met. However, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in Parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs. As you have said many times before, the EU has been clear that any withdrawal agreement would need to include a backstop to guarantee noto a hard border on the island of Ireland. Labour has long argued that the Government should change its negotiating red lines and seek signicant changes to the Political Declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU. That would also ensure that any backstop would be far less likely to be invoked. The changes we would need to see include: * A permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union. This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tarf and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals. We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. As you are aware, a customs union is supported by most businesses and trade unions. * Close alignment with the Single Market. This should be underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, with clear arrangements for dispute resolution. * Dynamic alignment on rights and protections so that UK standards keep pace with evolving standards across Europe as a minimum, allowing the UK to lead the way. * Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation. * Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases. We believe these negotiating objectives need to be enshrined in law before the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty for businesses and a clear framework for our future relationship. We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise. Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK. That approach should guide how alignment with EU regulations is to be maintained in future, as well discussions on dispute resolution, the role of the ECJ, and competition and migration rules. EU leaders have been clear that such changes to the Political Declaration and a closer relationship are possiblesuch a request is made by the UK government andthe current red lines change. We believe that a close economic relationship along these lines would make it far less likely that any backstop arrangements would ever be needed. The Government’s failure to secure a deal that can command the support of Parliament means time has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised. Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of ‘no deal’, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome. My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.

EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker rebuffed her bid to reopen talks on the -page Brexit deal - including a controversial backstop. So the pair have now arranged further talks - but only before the end of February. And questioned today, a No spokeswoman refused to rule out putting a revised deal to MPs in March - which would be just weeks before the UK leaves the EU on March .   Instead the No spokeswoman said: Were working to bring it back as soon as possible. Mrs May, whose convoy was ambushed by anti-Brexit protester, pointedly did not raise a smile as she arrived and shook hands with Mr Juncker at EU headquarters.  She also held talks with EU Parliament chiefs Guy Verhofstadt and Antonio Tajani, and EU Council President Donald Tusk - who said yesterday there was a special place in hell for Tory Brexiteers. She confronted Tusk over his hell remark, telling reporters it caused widespread dismay.But despite just  days being left to Brexit, it is believed Mrs May put forward no specic solutions today to break the deadlock. She told Mr Juncker she will continue to seek legally binding changes to the -page Brexit deal. Yet Mr Juncker made clear that the EU will not reopen talks on the deal.  Mrs May has promised MPs a general vote next Thursday  February which will let them direct the way forward. But this is not the same as a meaningful vote to pass or defeat her Brexit plan, with legal effect. Now, with talks on deadlock, there are fears that meaningful vote will only be held weeks before the UK leaves the EU.   One government source told the Mirror they feared the clock ticking down as late as March  before a deal is struck. And a joint statement issued by Mrs May and Mr Juncker today did not commit to a firm timeframe. The discussion was robust but constructive, the statement said. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council.  The Prime Minister and the President will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions. BrexitSecretary Stephen Barclay and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will also meet next Monday. The statement confirmed Mrs May set out MPs demands for a legally binding change to the backstop - an insurance clause that would keep the UK trapped under EU customs rules. Yet Mr Juncker underlined that the EU will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, which contains the backstop. Instead he is only willing to negotiate the separate political declaration, which spells out future trade. In a glimmer of hope, EU Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the political declaration could be upgraded to make it more binding.  He told reporters: Our proposal is to try to solve the problem in the political declaration. We are open as Parliament from Day One to upgrade this political declaration to make this political declaration more binding, more precise. Also on the issue of the backstop, explaining and saying very clearly that this is an insurance, not more than that. Mr Verhofstadt added that Mrs May assured him there is no question to remove a backstop. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn has offered Theresa May a way out of the mess.  Labours leader vowed to back her deal -she guarantees a full customs union with the EU. But Mrs May has already said she does not want a customs union, meaning the offer is unlikely to be taken up. And the big offer has enraged some Labour MPs who want Mr Corbyn to back a second referendum instead. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer was forced to intervene after a backlash, insisting the Labour leaders letter did not take the prospect of a public vote off the table.

Mr Corbyn was due to say: With realwages lower than they were  years ago, deep cuts to social security, rising borrowing just to make ends meet and the growth of insecure work, the Conservatives have created a perfect storm of low pay, insecurity and working poverty. This rising insecurity, with so many without savings to fall back on, is causing terrible stress for millions of families across the country.

Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament this week.   The current system caps the costs charged between EU and UK phone operators, letting them pass on the savings to customers. But the Mobile RoamingRegulations admit these caps will have no legal forcethere is no Brexit deal. That means phone giants could see their wholesale costs spiral, making roaming packages unaffordable and forcing them to push up costs, the government warns. Under the new rules, customers will still be prompted once theyve spent pound to prevent massive accidental bills. Travellers will also be prompted when theyve hit % and % of their data allowance. But it will spell the end of guaranteed free roaming across the EU, notes on the new law admit.  Alex Neill of consumer group Which  told HuffPost UK: “Anyto sky-high charges for using mobile phones abroad would be a bitter blow for millions of consumers. “The government should seek to avoid these charges by securing a deal with the EU. Butthat is not the outcome, companies must be absolutely clear about any extra charges their customers could be facing. Back when warnings first emerged about an end to roaming, the government insisted firms would not hike charges because of market competition. But MoneySavingExpert revealed last week that just two out of  major UK phone firms have guaranteed to keep free roaming in a No Deal Brexit . Most said they had no plans to raise charges - but stopped short of giving a cast-iron guarantee.  Consumer groups lobbied the government to keep roaming free by law. But after careful consideration the government did not agree, because it would pass all the costs on to phone firms. That, in turn, could have pushed up the cost of mobile phone tarfs overall to compensate, an explanatory note to the new law says. Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said: “These proposals prove that it will be holidaymakers and businesses that are forced to pay the price for this government’s incompetence. “It’s unacceptable that these plans have been snuck out. Ministers need to start being straight with the British public about the consequences of no deal and take it off the table once and for all.  The anti-Brexit group Best For Britain branded the fiasco the Last Days of Roam and claimed business travellers could be forced to pay pound more per month. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said: The cost of a hard Brexit on British travellers is becoming abundantly clear. Millions of people are facing higher costs to make calls and texts abroad because of the Prime Ministers botched Brexit plans. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “In the event we leave the EU without a deal, the continuation of surcharge-free mobile roaming for UK citizens travelling in the EU would be a commercial decision for the operators.” "},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful mum infectious laugh found","story":"NewsBeautul mum with an infectious laugh found dead at home aged just Ellie Majors dad said his daughter did not mean to take her own le after she was found with a lethal cocktail of drugs in her systemShareByTom Kershaw:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsEllie was found dead at home \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe heartbroken family of a beautul mum with an infectious laugh have paid tribute after she was found dead at her home.Ellie Major, , died with a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs in her system.Ms Majors dad said she did not mean to take her own le at her home in Hessle, Hull Live reports.Her family described her as a brilliant mum to her son, aged three. Paying tribute, Ms Majors sister, Emily Major, , said: You can see from the pictures how beautul and stunning my sister was. She was a loving and caring parent and a brilliant mother to her three-year-old son. She had a really distinctive and infectious laugh. At the inquest, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident.   Ms Majors father, Mark David Major, said she had been looking forward to spending time on two booked holidays. He said: I think it was just an accident. She was just wanting to get her high.

But it had taken six months for her to be assessed by mental health experts because she was not a high risk - a decision which her family said had contributed to her poor mental health.   Ms Majors social worker told the hearing that the young mum had been “at the bottom of her list” because she was at a low medium risk. She told the hearing through tears: When I found out about Ellie’s death I was following up an appointment with her. I never accepted it, and that is what has thrown me so much. When I spoke with Ellie, she reassured me that her previous attempt to take her own le was impulsive and she was very remourseful. But Ms Majors heartbroken mother Marie Mitchell, , said it was beyond her she had been deemed a low risk. She said: How they can say there is not an urgent risk for a mum who tried to take her own le is beyond me - and her first assessment only happened six months later. Service manager at the Humber NHS Trust Jo Kent had put together a report and said no lessons had been learnt since Ellie’s tragic death.  Workers at the mental health teams said that Ellie had not attended planned meetings. The family also demanded answers over why Ellie was still being given eight dferent types of medication, despite her using the drugs to take her own le previously. Mr Major said he grew concerned about his daughter when he did not receive a WhatsApp message from her. She was found dead in her home in Hessle on August , . Police Officer John Norcross found “boxes and bags of prescription drugs” across the property. PC Norcross told the hearing: There was no evidence of third party involvement or anything suspicious.  Dr Ian Richmond, consultant histopathologist, said that the medical cause of death was multiple drug toxicity. Concluding the inquest as an open conclusion, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident. He said: The evidence heard today could make me believe up to the civil standard of proof, that I am persuaded by her fathers communication, this is probably an accident. The family said they would be looking to lodge a complaint with the NHS and take things further.

Sun lovers Laurel Cormack and David Crook say the luxury five-star resort in Corfu looked like a swamp. They had been looking forward to spending two weeks at TUIs Mayor Verde Grand Resort in Agios Gordios, which has a well-publicised private beach. However when the couple got there they found the usually golden sands littered with towering ft-wide smelly seaweed mounds buzzing with flies. David claims they were only able to spend half a day on the hotel beach and had to abandon their sunbeds due to the seaweed-choked waters and head to the crowded hotel pool.   The recruitment consultant blasted TUIs cavalier attitude to their complaints and for failing to inform guests of the natural phenomenon in advance so they could make alternative plans. TUI said they were sorry to hear of their disappointment and would be in contact with them again. David, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said: Were very much beach people and always book hotels with their own piece of beach with them. If were relaxing we prefer to sit on the beach rather than by the pool as it always gets crowded. The black seaweed was in very long strips andyou put your foot in it it would stick to your legs. In the water it was ft deep.   The seaweed was smelly and had a lot of flies around it, the water wasnt clear either. The holiday wasnt as good as it could have been as the one facility we paid for [the beach], the whole reason we picked that hotel, we werent able to take advantage of. When we booked the holiday online I was expecting the golden sands I saw in the brochure, not mounds of stinking seaweed. The -year-old said both he and his customer service assistant we Laurel, , were taunted by glossy promotional videos displayed in the hotel showcasing the resorts unspoiled beaches.  David said: The really irritating thing was in the main reception they had a big -inch TV with a continuous looped video. It kept showing all the bits of the hotel that wed booked the holiday for and werent able to use because they were seaweeded out. They were even playing in the lts and showing the same thing - we couldnt get away from them. Grandad-of-one David said that diggers were out at am scooping up the seaweed from the sand and dumping it in mounds on the hotel area of the beach instead of taking it away. David said: When we complained about it the TUI rep shrugged her shoulders and said theres nothing we can do, the hotel and local authority is doing all they can.  The diggers were there a couple of hours from am on a few mornings trying to clear the beach but as fast as they moved it the seaweed ed. They werent removing it though just piling it up, it was an eyesore. Apparently a couple of weeks before we were there there was a dredger that took away about  tonnes of seaweed. We werent there for that but you dont order a dredger and get diggers on the beachits not a problem. We could have used the less affected public beach further along but that would have entailed paying for sunbeds, parasols and snacks which defeats the object of going all inclusive. Our argument has always been never about assigning blame or responsibility for the seaweed. Its a natural phenomena, its not the hotel or TUIs fault and I never said it was.  What I was really incensed about was the fact that all theyre doing is hiding behind it being a natural phenomena. It first started at the end of March and we went in June - theyd known about this for three months. Do they not monitor their resorts for this type of event  Do they not noty customers  If wed had an informed choice we wouldnt have cancelled our holiday, but we would have just gone to a dferent resort not affected by it. I dont want a load of money back, I just want them to hold their hands up and admit its something they should have made people aware of.  I wouldnt want other people to go through the experience, its just wrong. David complained to TUI in writing and said he was disappointed with their response - even receiving a missive thoughtlessly sent out. David said: I had an email from one TUI rep again explaining it was a natural phenomenon and that she was sorry about the incontinence this has caused. My first thought was that the email hadnt been put through spell check or checked for any autocorrects it was just speedily bashed out with little or no thought. Ive also tried speaking to them on the phone and on one glorious occasion was on hold for  minutes listening to a continuous loop of the same song - by the end of it I was losing the will to live. Dad-of-two David said the experience had put him off booking a TUI holiday in the future. David said: The cavalier attitude TUI took has meant that we will never use them again and nor would we recommend them. The amount we paid might not be a lot of money to a lot of people, but its a big chunk of money for us. Were not wealthy people were just normal working people - its our two weeks of rest and relaxation. TUIs whole attitude really disappointed me, its just left a really bad taste in the mouth. I never said it was their fault, all I was saying was do you not monitor your resorts for this kind of occurrences to let people know so they can make an informed choice about whether they want to proceed with it or not  A TUI spokesman said: Were sorry to hear of the Cormack partys disappointment and we will be in contact the customers directly once again to discuss in further detail.

The moment had been a long time coming for Mr Whaley who travelled from his home in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire to the facility in Switzerland with we Ann, adopted children Alix and Dominic, and some close friends. But before the -year-old took his last breath surrounded by his loved ones, there was one final thing he needed to do - publish a haunting letter he hoped would be his legacy.He titled it: By the time you read this, I will be dead and addressed it to all Members of Parliament urging them to change the law surrounding assisted suicide .  No family should ever have to endure the torment we have undergone in recent weeks, the retired accountant wrote. But it will be easier to bear knowing that by sharing it we can contribute to future change. Mr Whaley, a grandfather-of-four, was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease, an incurable, terminal illness, in . As the years passed he lost the use of his limbs. His ability to speak, swallow and breath also began to rapidly deteriorate. However, he knew the worst was still to come which is why he chose to die in Switzerland rather than face immense suffering in the end stages of the devastating condition.He admitted to the BBC : This is one of the illnesses you wouldnt wish on your worst enemy.  But not only was Mr Whaley crippled by the disease in his final weeks, he says he suffered immense anguish at the hands of police and social services who were tipped off about Mr Whaleys plans. Mrs Whaley, , found herself being interviewed under caution by Thames Valley Police. And Mr Whaley said the added stress of police involvement had destroyed everything we had done to prepare ourselves. He wrote: I was saying my final goodbyes and preparing myself for the end, the final, biggest bomb dropped and I could no longer keep it together.   This bomb was in fact an anonymous phone call to social services who informed the police of my plans to go to Switzerland. Within hours Ann and I were facing a criminal investigation. The thought that I might not make it to Switzerland, or that,I did, Ann might be facing  years in jail for helping me, was almost too much to bear. Mrs Whaley, , who supported her husbands decision, told the BBC it was the first time in their  years of marriage that she had ever seen her husband cry. He said everything that Ive worked for to protect you has all been blown apart by this anonymous phone call, she said.   I wasnt frightened because I didnt feel like Id done anything wrong. I wasnt ashamed. I was cross. There was a policewoman and a detective sergeant and they were clearly not expecting to find a non-abusive situation because they were very embarrassed about the whole thing. Helping someone commit suicide is punishable by up to  years in prison. Mrs Whaley booked the flights to Switzerland and a hotel because her husband could no longer use his hands. It was so ridiculous to put us through this when he is in the final few days of le, she said. Police have since dropped the case, but the couple want to see the law changed to allow assisted dying in some circumstances.  They believe the law can be written to ensure vulnerable people are still protected from abuse. Mrs Whaley admitted: I just want him to be here, but I know what he has chosen to do is the right thing for him.I wouldnt put an animal through what he would go throughhe went to the end. At least three Britons have faced a police investigation after ing from a loved ones assisted death at a Dignitas clinic, the Times reported, although no-one has been prosecuted. When askedhe is concerned about the consequences his we could face, Mr Whaley, who spent his last night having dinner with his family at a hotel in Zurich, replied: Ann can handle anything. The one thing that has worried me all along is leaving Ann because Ive spent all my le protecting her. Now shell be without me, but I know shell get through it. Mr Whaleys letter to MPs in full: Dear Members of Parliament, By the time you read this, I will be dead. On Thursday th February , I will have taken medication that will end my le, surrounded by my we, Ann, my children, Alix and Dominic, and a couple of my dearest friends at the Dignitas facility in Switzerland. With their love and support I have been able to fulfil my final wish: to be in control of my end, rather than endure the immense suffering motor neurone disease had in store for me. I want to impress upon you the anguish me and my family have experienced, not because of this awful illness , but because of the law against assisted dying in this country. The blanket ban on assisted dying has not only forced me to spend thousands of pounds and endure months of logistical hurdles in order to secure a peaceful and dignied death overseas, but it has meant that my final weeks of le have been blighted by visits from social services and police. Since my diagnosis of MND, an incurable, terminal illness, in , I felt as though bombs have been dropping on me. I gradually lost the use of all four limbs. My ability to speak, swallow and breathe began rapidly deteriorating. I knew my death was inevitable and unavoidable, but I remained strong for my family. I am  years old and have lived a full le. I did not fear death, but I did fear the journey. I simply wanted to cut this suffering short by a few months. When I eventually got the ‘green light’ from Dignitas, a weight lted I was able to get on with living without the constant mental anguish over my death. But then, as I was saying my final goodbyes and preparing myself for the end, the final, biggest bomb dropped and I could no longer keep it together. This bomb was in fact an anonymous phone call to social services who informed the police of my plans to go to Switzerland. Within hours Ann and I were facing a criminal investigation. The thought that I might not make it to Switzerland, or that,I did, Ann might be facing  years in jail for helping me, was almost too much to bear. In  years of marriage, Ann had not seen me cry. The day we were contacted by the police, I sobbed. The law in this country robbed me of control over my death. It forced me to seek solace in Switzerland. Then it sought to punish those attempting to help me get there. The hypocrisy and cruelty of this is astounding. Though it is perfectly legal for me make arrangements and travel to Dignitas by myself, the minute anyone  ‘assists’ me in any way – which is essential, due to my condition – they are liable for prosecution. I had the chance, just over a week before my death, to speak to some MPs and Peers about my experience and my adamant wish that the law should be changed. The overwhelming reaction in the room was one of agreement however, I am aware that despite huge public support for an assisted dying law, most members of parliament currently oppose it. I spoke to one MP who had voted against the last assisted dying Bill in . The law being proposed was limited to terminally ill, mentally competent adults in their final months, with strict inbuilt safeguards to protect the vulnerable and anyone  who has not made a clear decision of their own volition. When I pressed her on why she felt people like me should be denied a say over our own death and be forced to suffer, she was unable to articulate an answer. I want MPs to know that change is urgently needed and that it is achievable – over  million people in several American and Australian states and across Canada are covered by assisted dying laws which allow choice to dying people and protection to others. No family should ever have to endure the torment we have undergone in recent weeks, but it will be easier to bear knowing that by sharing it we can contribute to future change. I sincerely hope that you will truly listen to our story and see the suffering you are inflicting by upholding the status quo. Yours sincerely, Geoffrey Whaley "},{"url":null,"title":"how free chocolate delivered your","story":"NewsHow to get free chocolate delivered to your door on Valentines DayValentines Day is right around the corner and Airtasker are offering people the chance to get their hands on a free sweet treat to celebrateShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB NewsTheres an easy way to get a sweet treat this Valentines Day\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Like Marmite, Valentines Day is one of those things that you either love or hate.But no matter how you feel about February , one company is offering a simple way to make the day a little more special for you.Airtasker, an online business which allows people to source help for tasks such as moving furniture, gardening and plumbing are planning to deliver chocolate free of charge across two cities in the UK and its really simple to get yourself or a loved one in on the action.

She teamed the pound, green dress with black tights and trendy black boots. But fashion lovers quickly spotted something a little strange about the bright look - and theyre not impressed.

Kate was asked to bring an item that made her happy along to one of the schools, and what she picked was adoarble.She took a photo of her family - including Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte - which she took out of her purse and proudly showed it off the the pupils.The printed picture is the adorable snap the Cambridge family used for their Christmas cards this year, and shows them sitting on a log in the grounds of their county home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk.They are all dressed for the autumn, with Prince Louis wearing several handmedowns, and look relaxed and happy.

Now Jacky Rom, from Romford in Essex, is desperate to trace the man caught up in the mix-up, because he was much nicer than the man she ended up meeting. Jackie had arranged to meet a man on dating app Plenty of Fish. When she arrived at the Fox and Raven in Chelmsford, she was excited to be greeted by a man with a twinkle in his eye, Essex Live reports. But sadly for her it turned out the mystery man was supposed to be on a date with someone  - and the mix-up only came to light when their real dates turned up. Now Jacky is desperate to find the man she thought she was meant to be dating.  Jacky, who has a -year-old daughter and has been single for nine months, spent Monday morning preparing for her first ever blind date, dressing to impress. She said: When I pulled up in the car park I saw a guy behind me and thought he looked nice, I did think it was a bit funny that he didnt say hello. I went inside and ordered a drink and sat down, when he walked in he came over to me straight away greeted me with a peck on the cheek and said I thought you were a red head. When he said that I didnt think much of it, because I have always had dferent coloured hair, I just thought I was pleased with my choice.   He had a twinkle in his eye and he was a gentleman, even though I wasnt what he expected when he saw me he said its ok, it doesnt matter. He then went over to the bar and got himself a drink, at which point my actual date walked in. It was only a matter of minutes that Jacky spent with the man she mistook for her date but she said: It didnt even occur to me he was the wrong person I didnt even think of that I thought oh a nice guy for a change. My actual date was no where near as nice as the other man, but we all at that point had realised what had happened and laughed about it. When the red head turned up shortly after the four went their separate ways and continued their dates.   Jacky, who is an author, said: It was so annoying, we were sat there chatting away and I was not giving him my full attention. I was thinking about pretending to go to the toilet and instead running outside and putting my business card on his car windscreen, because I knew what car he had as he followed me in. But after about  minutes they just left and I couldnt do anything, I didnt knowthey had had a good date or not. Jacky has been single for nine months and downloaded Plenty of Fish around a month ago to seeshe could find love, and this was her first ever blind date. She said: Its a shame I had the coffee with the wrong one. I would like the chance I missed. Now, having recovered from the embarrassment, she wants to track down the mystery man. The four shared a moment of awkwardness before laughing it off. Jacky described the man as being around  foot tall with an unusual haircut. She said: It was grey and it was closely shaven at the sides and longer on top, he looked very stylish and was wearing grey skinny jeans. Jacky estimated his age to be around - but she couldnt recallthe man had facial hair or not. She also described him as having a local accent. Despite downloading Tinder, match and Bumble in a bid to find the man, Jacky has had no luck and reached out to Essex Live for help. She said: I would kick myselfI didnt at least try to reach out and find him.

He winces with pain as he plumps his grubby duvet and lies down, zipping the flap shut behind him Because in , roofer Steve broke his back in three places falling off a building, and sleeping on a wet, cold street is agony. “After the fall I lost my job and my home,” he croaks through a sore throat . “I came home to the Rhondda then ended up here on the streets six weeks ago. “I went to a hostel one night but got pick-pocketed while I was sleeping and the place was full of druggies.The second time I had night terrors and a member of staff woke me up by slapping me, hard. So I feel safer here. “But it’s bloody miserable. I just want my own place again, to get back on my feet.” Steve is just one of dozens of tent dwellers living in the centre of Cardf who reveal the complexity of Britain’s rough-sleeping crisis.   There were some , homeless people in Wales last year – a rise of % in  months – with , in the capital. But the number of rough sleepers in Cardf doubled in three years, to around . Last month a Tory councillor was suspended, though later reinstated, for demanding their tents be “torn down” as they were harming local businesses. And since “tentgate” made headlines, even more people have appeared under canvas on the city’s streets.But Cardf has some of the best homeless services in the UK, with hundreds of places in council and charity-run hostels and outreach teams offering support. Every night there are least  surplus bed spaces. So why does anyone need to sleep in a tent or doorway   Rough sleepers say they feel safety on the streets and maintain their independence. Charities blame the lack of social housing, rent increases, welfare reforms and the Universal Credit debacle – along with an “explosion” in spice use and substance addiction in Cardf, and an increase in mental health issues.  Those they do help into accommodation cannot always maintain it, leading to what council outreach workers call “a revolving door of homelessness”. But tent dwellers like Steve dream of having a real front door again. So does Donna. She and her husband Paul, , have been living in a tent in the pedestrian shopping area for three weeks.  They were evicted on Donna’s th birthday, when their landlord suddenly sold up. Paul has recovered from a stroke and a heart attack and beaten bowel cancer, and both he and Donna have mental health issues. “We’ve been to a hostel, but never again,” she says. “It was filthy used needles in the shower, people openly taking drugs and robbing each other. It’s no good for you. “Sleeping in doorways is far too dangerous, so a tent is the best solution.  “It keeps you warm and dry and out of the way of the shop owners trying to make a living.” She invites me in to her immaculately kept tent. We sit on a brightly coloured patchwork blanket surrounded by all her belongings, lined up neatly or packed in bags. There is even an air freshener in the corner and a pint of milk keeping cool by the door. “I take pride in keeping it nice,” she says. “I sweep it all out every day. Everything’s got to be tidy.  “And we’re on a the waiting list for accommodation, so hopefully it won’t be long before we’re out of here. I just want to get back behind my own front door again.” But for now, like Steve and the other tent dwellers, a zipped-up a flap of canvas will have to do.

Job applicant Victoria Atkins, , applied for a role at Intenso Espresso in Hove, East Sussex, and went for a trial sht after passing the interview stage. But, when she was unable to make her sht due to bad weather, Victoria claims she was sent a series of rude messages from Jullian Preston-Powers. Jullian, who claims to have a supervisory role at the cafe and is married to the owner, slammed her no-show, claiming a poor work ethic... is highly synonymous with being British. The businessman went on to state that staff cannot ever call in sick and that he would dock wages from a previous shtthey did so without a doctors note. He went on to champion one staff member who hadnt had a day off in three years because that was normal for thin, healthy people who dont eat bacon.   Victoria said she was very, very offended and branded his statements about British workers nasty. However, when approached for comment, Jullian defended and reiterated his stance that the very poorest type of employee is a British one, full stop. The Trades Union Congress slammed his actions and defended British workers, who they claim put in some of the longest hours in Europe. Victoria, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: He is very rude and nasty. I felt disgusted in his expectations and it just goes to show how hes not an understanding, professional business owner at all. Id had a really bad morning and just askedI could rebook the trial sht. Id taken the bus and left plenty of time, but due to delays I soon realised I would be late. By this time I was soaking wet because the bus only went half way, and my friend lives on the same road as the cafe so I went there to shower and dry off. I was already a couple of hours late so askedI could go at a later date, which is when he said no. Dont get me wrong, I understand why he didnt let me just do another sht, but his comments about British people having no work ethic were shocking.   Victoria claims the member of staff who interviewed her had been polite and really lovely and even offered her a trial sht, however she felt very, very offended by the comments made by Jullian. His responses to her texts left her feeling that she was grateful he showed who he really is before she accepted a job. Victoria said: [The member of staff] was really lovely and after the interview she asked me to come back for a trial sht the next day. I feel sorry for the stafftheyre going into work ill because theyre scared of losing pay. Ive worked in the food and drinks industry for years and used to be a barista at [popular coffee chain] and trained as a maestro. I also took management courses. I had plenty of experience and knew how to do the job well. When he made the comment about eating bacon, I was very, very offended. I never even met him and Im happy as a size . He wasnt even at my job interview. Its like saying all British people are fat when especially in Brighton, we are known for lots of vegans. In his message, Jullian wrote: Sorry you are having a stressful morning. Its probably better you did not succeed in getting the job because you can never be late for or miss work at our business. Ever.   You cannot ever even call in sick as that is not allowed. Literally, you have to be at work as scheduled with us andyou do not, you get a whole days wages from your previous sht docked and then are sackedit happens just once again. We are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics. When Victoria replied saying how dare he be rude to her because she is British and that he was an awful business owner, Jullian carried on in further messages. His second message read: Not because you are British, because you managed to show poor work ethic before even getting a job - which is HIGHLY synonymous with being British! [OMITTED] is perfectly happy and has been with us into her third year now. She has a well paying job and has never, not once, called in sick. Victoria responded: Well its not normal to never be sick in the space of three years. Maybe she is spreading her germs about the cafe haha og well Im done now good luck to you. Jullian then said: Yes, it is normal for thin, healthy people who dont eat bacon. Victoria wrote back: Im not fat, thank you. Im very happy with my body.   In response to allegations made by Victoria, Jullian stood by his belief that British people have poor work ethic and claims every single British person he has employed in the past has had issues. He said his business experience was that the work ethic of Brits are inferior to those of from Eastern Europe. Jullian said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop. The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British. It is true, comprehensively, that every single one of the British employees that weve had will call in and have some issues, or be late. Be very dferent employee to have. But when you have someone who comes from a country where there are no jobs and appreciate they have a job, they work every single hour. Its just a preference and making it very clear and being honest about what genre of people have the best work ethic. We dont not employ British people, the business employs three British people. Were British and we hire British people. In his text messages to Victoria, he also claimed he would dock the pay of an employees previous shtthey call in sick without a doctors note. He admits he operates outside of the legal position to ensure the business is not affected.   Jullian said: The legal position is that you can self-certy, but we work outside of that. We specically use policies that are beneficial to small businesses. We have a policy thatyou dont show up for work, for whatever reason, the entire previous sht will be docked from your wages, unless you can provide a doctors note to prove youre too sick to work. What British people do specically is they really take advantage of the fact they have a benefit system and theyre not motivated to earn money. If you were someone who was to have your day off and the manager calls you up to say Im very sorry, [someone] didnt turn up for work. The shops still closed - can you go in, what we do for that person is pay them double pay. If someone worked eight hours the day before then doesnt show up for work, their previous sht pays for the double pay for the other person, because why should the business have to pay for that  Statisticallyyou there were ever such an analysis drawn across peoples backgrounds and where they were from, there would be a massive spike in British absences unfortunately. In his final message, Jullian mentions that one of his employees had managed three years without a sick day because she doesnt eat bacon. He claims this was in response to her new diet and that she was thin - but admitted hed never met Victoria in person and made no judgemental condescension as to her weight or diet. Jullian said: Ive had hundreds of messages of support coming through. We just recently employed a British man who is  years old who has been working in the coffee business for many, many years.[An employee] and I had a meeting this morning - this woman [Victoria] has caused hundreds of people to put negative reviews all over TripAdvisor, Facebook and Googl , so its been quite detrimental to the business.A TUC spokesperson said: If hes looking for the title of Britains Worst Boss, it sounds like hes going about it the right way. Its illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity. And profiteering from staff illness by docking their wages is very likely illegal too. Britains workers have a very strong work ethic. They put in some of the longest hours in Europe and billions of pounds worth of unpaid overtime each year. In , the outspoken businessman told a -year-old member of staff to quit smoking or shed be fired - and successfully helped her kick the habit. Cafe management have also referred to three ex-staff members as having the mental acruity of an apple on TripAdvisor.

I was so worried people would stare, and when it’s something like skin that you can’t even cover up, it’s all the more soul-destroying.”  Larissa, who teaches navigation, was first diagnosed with eczema when she was just nine-months-old. With doctors hoping she would eventually grow out of it, she intermittently used small doses of prescribed steroid creams throughout her childhood. Larissa said: “I’d find that sunshine and sea water were a massive help. “I remember my eczema being particularly bad on my joints and how I’d get told off for scratching in class. “But, now I think back, it’s nowhere near as severe as dealing with TSW.”  Instead of easing, her eczema became more severe as an adult, although stress was the only trigger she could identy. Larissa said: “I look back now and try to figure out patterns, examining what was happening in my le at particular points and trying to work out why that’d make it better or worse. “The major trigger I found was stress. I tried my best to minimise it in my le, but sometimes, it’s out of our control. “There is an awful lot of pressure in le now. People are so busy and want to do everything as fast as possible. Then there’s also things like social media, and how it makes us compare ourselves to others.  “They sound like little micro-stresses, but they can all add up without you realising.”As her skin condition became more severe, Larissas use of steroid cream increased until eventually, by around , she was applying it every few hours having been told to use as much as she needed.But the more she used, the less effective it became. Larissa said: “You see that word steroid and know it’s not something you want to be using every single day. “By the end, I was getting no relief whatsoever from the creams.  “I was still having to bandage my wrists and arms every night to minimise scratching in my sleep, and had to be incredibly careful about what products or materials I put on my skin. “I used to love cosmetics, and have this whole vanity case of lovely makeup that I can’t use. I could only apply moisturiser to my face, or use prescribed shower gel. “It made it even harder that there was nothing I could do to cover up my skin.” At the end of January , she ditched the steroid creams for good, but was completely unprepared for the severe reaction to come. By March, Larissas skin – particularly on her face – felt tight, red and raw, asshe had been burned. Then, after posting photos to some online eczema support groups for advice, a fellow sufferer mentioned TSW for the first time. She became convinced this was what was cuasing her problems. Larissa said: “I contacted some friends that work in medicine and they sent me over some studies to read. “The condition is such an unknown, especially as controlled studies are virtually impossible, as they’d mean withholding eczema treatment from somebody who really needs it.  “But the only change I could think of that had sparked this was coming off the creams. “I made an emergency dermatology appointment, but things went downhill very quickly. It got to the point where even showering would leave me in tears, as it was so painful and my skin was so raw I couldn’t even wear underwear.” Eventually, her entire body affected, Larissa had no choice but to start a course of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin. She has also been seeing a naturopath to discuss alternative therapies, as well as a hypnotherapist and cognitive behavioural therapist to deal with the emotional turmoil. Larissa said: “People don’t understand, and think it sounds silly to be saying this about a skin condition, but there were genuinely times when I wondered how I was going to get through,the rest of my le was going to be like this,” she admitted. “Everyday things that you take for granted were so dficult, like undressing for a shower. Not only was it painful – I also didn’t want to have to look at myself. “Thankfully, I am feeling much stronger, though the not knowing why this happened, and living with something so unpredictable is still very tough.” Larissa, who has now moved on from taking cyclosporin and is beginning a course of an antibody called duplimab, is urging doctors to treat eczema patients such as herself holistically, rather than simply prescribing steroid creams. She said: “There is a time and a place for steroid treatments. Everyone is dferent and they can help some people, but we also need to be looking at triggers like stress and diet. Every journey is dferent, and iniduals need to do what they can to help themselves. “There is, in my mind, a clear link between mental health and skin conditions. Stress is a huge trigger, and you are bound to feel low when there is no end in sight and every little thing you do is a huge decision about whether it’ll make your skin better or worse. “We are getting better at talking about mental health but we still need to be changing our approach and looking at things as a whole.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gucci slammed unacceptable balaclava jumper","story":"NewsGucci slammed for unacceptable balaclava jumper that resembles blackfaceHigh fashion brand Gucci has been slammed on social media over a piece of womens knitwearShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe brand has faced criticism over the jumper \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGucci has been embroiled in a racism row over a womens jumper that critics say resembles blackface.

She said: The negative comments are nothing I haven’t heard all my le, or called myself for fun anyway. I get the typical insults - fat cow, Shamu, like the killer whale, or lard a*se. “Im a very positive person, so I generally ignore it, or leave a playful comment back. “Body positivity is such a controversial topic and no matter what I say, there will always be people with their swords drawn, ready to fight me on this, so I’ll keep it simple - everybody and every body is beautul.

After managing to shed seven stone she realised she had only lost the weight to fit in with those around her and was more comfortable being big. Amanda said: Being fat makes me happy, physically and sexually. Introduced to feederism by a friend in , Amanda is known as a gainer, or feedee - someone who likes the physical act of getting bigger, so either increases their size by overeating or by using padding to make themselves larger. There are also feeders, who like to watch others getting bigger and encourage their weight gain. She said: I was shy about feederism at first.  But, as time went on, it felt more like my calling and slowly but surely, I fell in love with the community.Starting out on Feabie, a social network for feedees and feeders, Amanda then moved onto the micro-blogging site Tumblr, before setting up her own Instagram .Before long, she had amassed almost , followers. And, while she wont reveal exact monthly income, she says that she makes most of her money through paid promotions on Instagram and Patreon where people can set up their own subscription services. Working on a three tier system, she charges for access to all her videos and photos, for the additional benefit of her Snapchat, for a FaceTime call and for all of the above, plus extra adult content.  Explaining the types of videos she creates, Amanda said: “I do stuffing videos, where I eat massive amounts of food, funnel feeding videos, where I funnel down liquids through a tube and weight gain shake chug, where I down large amounts of liquid in little time, so my belly looks even more swollen. “This is all as well as other fat fetish content, including fantasy talk or playing with my belly.” Typically, Amanda films two to three videos a day for her Patreon supporters and those who have submitted specic requests. She also live streams via Instagram, so her fans can feel more connected to her.  Usually eating around , calories a day, this can rise to as many as , when she is filming, depending on what she has been asked to eat. Amanda said: I get tonnes of interesting questions and requests when it comes to food. I feel the most popular food people enjoy seeing me eat is Taco Bell, burgers and fruit. One guy paid me to eat  pears and crack open a coconut to drink its milk while half naked on camera. I love creative and interesting ideas, so my job is never boring. Personally, I don’t find it dficult to maintain my size for my followers.  I’m naturally a bigger girl, so as long as I continue to eat well, I easily stay fluffy and gain for my fans.

This is a national scandal staring at us in plain sight. The figures are damning: the number of people living in the streets has risen by % since the Conservatives came to power, more than  die sleeping rough each year, , households are homeless. But statistics never tell the full story. That is why the Mirror wanted to give voice to those who have fallen on hard times. Their stories are of people who have struggled with addiction, people with mental health problems and people with nowhere  to turn. They are scared, lonely and destitute. Many tell of how they have been assaulted, had their tents stolen and let down by the services supposed to support them. There are also stories of great kindness and compassion. The volunteers who get up at the crack of dawn to check on rough sleepers in their area, the charities which provide vital support and the health workers who have mended broken lives. Above all, we heard time and time again from people who never thought they would be in this position.  As one homeless person told us: “people are a tissue-thin slice away from disaster, they just don’t think about it.” In a country as rich as Britain this shouldn’t be the case. We are seeing the consequences of a government which stopped caring. The safety net which should be there has been torn to shreds. You could point to the Universal Credit or the shortage of accommodation or the lack of drug treatment services or the paucity of mental health provision. All are responsible for the rise in rough sleeping and all flow from the cuts imposed by this Tory government. What makes this so shameful is there is a better way. The Housing First strategy pursued in Scotland is transforming lives by giving people a secure home and support for addiction or mental health problems. If the Government is serious about tackling rough sleeping it should follow this approach. We have given those on the streets a voice. Now we need to give them hope.

Her sweet Giovanna had always had a small pot belly, but watching her train, she could see her stomach was clearly jutting out. And later, when feeling the schoolgirls protruding stomach, she was shocked to find what appeared to be a five-month baby bump. I fretted, imagining the worst, Ange recalled. With her daughters stomach rock hard, she began asking herself terrying questions, like whether the teen could have been assaulted. But it would later turn out that Giovanna wasnt expecting. Instead, she had silent killer oian cancer - with the mystery bump actually a football-sized tumour on her oy.And in July , despite gruelling chemotherapy, Giovanna peacefully passed away, surrounded by her heartbroken family. The courageous teen had only recently turned . Our daughter is the bravest, strongest, most beautul person I ever knew, Ange, from Merbein, Australia, toldtoday. And I am so proud and honoured that she chose me to be her mum. In a message to other parents, she added: Always talk with your children about their health and being aware of changes in their body.  Have the dialogue open and teach them that they can advocate for their health. Education is key in our children learning more about their bodies as well as silent illnesses that can arise. Bubbly Giovanna, known affectionately as G, had been taking part in netball training when her coach approached her mum. She asked her, Is Giovanna pregnant , leaving her furious.In a beautul letter to her daughter, published on Kidspot , Ange recalls: What the hell  She’s only a kid! I fumed inwardly.But that night, the mum gently asked her daughter whether she could feel her stomach - and discovered the apparent baby bump. Putting my hands on your stomach, it felt like a five-month baby bump and hard as a rock, she writes in the letter.  The following day, Giovanna was taken to the doctors, where she did a pregnancy test before being rushed for an ultrasound. The scan revealed her enormous growth. And later, after undergoing surgery to remove her -kilo tumour, the brave teenager was diagnosed with oian cancer. They removed her oy along with a kg tumour, Ange told us. Giovanna recovered in hospital for the next five days. By this time disbelief had worn off and we were all upbeat about going home, and of course Giovanna was over the moon with her now new figure and flat tummy. [But on] May , , we were rushed down to Melbourne to be told Giovanna had oian cancer. The schoolgirl, who had undergone the operation at Victorias Royal Childrens Hospital, subsequently underwent chemotherapy.  She had her first round of treatment on her th birthday. While her main concern was the thought of losing her hair, her mum feared that she may not be able to have children in the future. Little did we know this was not our main concern, Ange said. She added: All she wanted for her birthday was a party with all her friends, so two weeks after her chemo  of her best friends joined her in celebrating her th birthday. She said afterwards that it was the best night of her le. I am so glad and thankful that we did this, it is even more special now as it was to be her last birthday. Giovanna, who had also been suffering from tiredness before her diagnosis, was rushed back to hospital at the end of May .  She was in agonising pain, with her stomach growing once again. And this time, it swelled to the size of a nine-month baby bump. I even had to buy you a pair of size- pyjama pants, Ange, who also has a son, Nando, writes in her touching letter to her daughter. After spending a week at Royal Childrens Hospital, Giovanna was transferred to the Royal Womens Hospital in Parkville, Melbourne. Despite medics best efforts, her organs began shutting down and she was sedated to ease her pain, as her family stayed beside her. And at .pm on July , the schoolgirl lost her courageous battle, as her distraught mum sobbed: Go darling, fly with the angels. Her final, selfless wish was for her family to raise money to fund Ronald McDonald Houses, which provide a home away from home for seriously ill children and their loved ones.   Today, Ange and her husband Fred are living every persons worst nightmare, suffering from a dull ache that is constantly present.But in honour of their beloved daughter, they have set up Giovannas Gt , a charity which raises awareness and money for oian cancer research and Ronald McDonald Houses.The couple, who are determined to make sure no-one  has to walk in their shoes, fund a room at the Ronald McDonald House in Parkville in memory of Giovanna. And they also raise much-needed funds for teenagers with cancer who at times are the forgotten ones when it comes to gts and items of need.   They are desperate to spare other families the same pain they are going through. Oian cancer, the silent killer, is not so well known as its cousin, breast cancer, yet can be far more dangerous, Ange said. Oian cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women, but its symptoms can be dficult to recognise.According to the NHS , they include a swollen stomach, feeling constantly bloated, stomach or pelvic discomfort, feeling full quickly when eating, and needing to urinate more often than normal.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5435fee7f0d9.26716581.jpg ","title":"dundee united loan signing charlie seaman wants to return to bournemouth with medal","story":"Dundee United loan signing Charlie Seaman has come to Dundee United to develop as a player and get first-team experience.And he also aims to be heading back to parent club Bournemouth this summer with a Scottish Championship medal in his pocket.In capturing the -year-old full-back from one of the surprise success stories of the English Premier League over the past few seasons, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson stressed the deal was exactly what it said on the tin – a loan.The end of the season will see Seaman head back to the south coast and be expected to challenge for a top-team place with the Cherries.However, while his time in Scotland will be a learning experience, the former West Ham youth wants success as well.“Hopefully, coming here and learning dferent things will help me for when I go back for next season,” he said.“I can learn dferent styles here so I am really happy to be in Scotland with United.“The boys here love to play football and that’s good because it’s that way down at Bournemouth.“Every side of the game, though, on the ball, off the ball I am trying to learn, it’s what I’m here for. Defensively I am trying to be better and I want to be better offensively as well.“I came here to get experience of first-team football. I was waiting for my chance at Bournemouth but I felt I could get it here sooner, get some games for the rest of the season. Hopefully I will be more readyI get the opportunity when I go back, or wherever it may be.“There is a job to do for the team as well and our goal at Dundee United is to win this league. Yes, it would be nice to be finishing the season with a medal for that.”Seaman’s time north of the border hardly got off to the perfect start and, within hours of his arrival, he was tasting defeat as United went down to Ayr.His temporary manager was disappointed with the team performance at Somerset Park but did make a point of saying the new arrival had put in some good work.The young full-back took encouragement from that but has admitted he did not necessarily agree with Robbie’s assessment.“I was happy to make my debut last week, obviously disappointed with the loss, but it was good to get out there and experience something dferent,” he added.“I didn’t think I started the game too well but I thought I grew into it. Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week. So I’ve an idea of what to expect and I am looking forward to playing in front of our own fans.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c593edc5c5222.30407689.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds ian harkes is making his dundonian grandad very happy","story":"He had never been to the city before signing for Dundee United and, despite being born down south, Ian Harkes was so young when his family headed back to America he has no memory of his year or two in Britain.However, family ties mean moving to Dundee has been something of a homecoming for the -year-old American.As was well-documented when he signed up last month, grandad James is a Dundonian and was delighted when Ian told him he was joining boyhood heroes United.That made his impressive home debut against Morton at the weekend a special moment not just for Ian but his family back in the States and, in particular, James, who was born a stone’s throw away in Fleming Gardens.For Ian, though, just as special as those family ties is the fact he’s now playing his football in a city and country where football isn’t just a sport, it’s a way of le.“It was good to be in for my home debut at Tannadice and I thought my energy was good,” he said.“I spoke to my grandad a couple of weeks ago and he was over the moon at me signing and I’ll be speaking to him again soon because I’m sure he was delighted about me playing at Tannadice.“The whole family caught the game I think and they were pleased. I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5ac61f76f544.56248025.jpg ","title":"free cash folk throughout dundee perthshire and fife in line for cold weather payment are you eligible","story":"People throughout Dundee are in line to receive cash after the recent bout of cold weather.The Government#s Cold Weather Payment scheme dishes out £ to people living in an area where the average temperature has been C or below for seven consecutive days.Every person living in the DD postcodes endured these conditions between January  and February , it has been confirmed.Folk in Perthshire and Fe are also in line to receive a windfall due to the cold weather.Click here to seeyou are eligible."},{"url":null,"title":"raiders take car keys from dundee home then drive off with owners ford fusion car","story":"Police are appealing for information after a raid on a Dundee home.A break-in took place in Argyle Street between January  and February .Car keys were taken prior to the vehicle # a Ford Fusion car, registration GP MBY # being stolen.Televisions and bikes were also stolen.A police statement said: #Call you know where the car or property is.

That could change in Saturday’s Scottish Cup visit to St Mirren and at the very least he will provide experienced cover for Benjamin Siegrist.Charlie SeamanIt was a dficult start for the Bournemouth kid as he made his debut in the defeat at Ayr United just hours after flying north to begin his loan. The -year-old, however, did reasonably well at Somerset Park and looked good as he made his home debut in Saturday’s win over Morton.Mark ReynoldsThe vastly-experienced Aberdeen defender showed his ability and know-how as he strolled through his debut against the Ton, despite injury meaning that was his first competitive outing since last May. Reynolds was handed the captain’s armband and showed leadership qualities that could prove vital in the coming months.Mark ConnollyThe arrival from Crawley Town is another centre-half and Saturday saw him show instant signs of being able to form a solid partnership with Reynolds. The Irishman is a no-nonsense defender who looks perfect for the physical requirements of the Championship.Calum ButcherBack for a second spell at United having previously played at Tannadice under Jackie McNamara, the midfielder was brought in to add bite in that area of the park. He lasted an hour at the weekend and in that time won his tackles and had a big influence on those around him in the middle of the park.Ian HarkesThe -year-old American was something of a surprise arrival but with his energetic box-to-box running has shown why Robbie Neilson wanted him. The former DC United team-mate of Wayne Rooney covered a lot of ground and, as he showed in the Scottish Cup win at Montrose, also has a goal in him.Morgaro GomisAnother who is ing to United, in his case for a third spell in tangerine. Gomis blotted his copy book by picking up a red card in that defeat at Ayr. Now , the  Scottish Cup winner is unlikely to start every game but will provide good cover in central midfield.Peter PawlettThe manager spent most of last month working to secure the services of the former Aberdeen man who played for him at MK Dons. Pawlett wasted no time showing why with a superb debut against Morton that saw him grab his first United goal. His pace, use of the ball and movement off it means he will be a very big player.Cammy SmithThe third of the arrivals who have played for United before. Smith has fitted in well since joining up from St Mirren. He goes about his work in quietly but his knowledge of how to win promotion from this ision makes him an asset.Aidan NesbittAnother who played for Neilson at MK Dons. The former Celtic kid has signed until the end of the season and so far only one of his five appearances have been as a starter. At , the attacker could be one for the future –he can add goals to the nice touches seen so far.Osman SowAnother ex-MK Don and the Swedish striker also played for Neilson during a successful spell at Hearts. The -year-old has had a lack of game time buthe can get his match fitness back quickly there is no question he has the ability to get goals in this ision."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5ac5be685351.60124964.jpg ","title":"we need emergency shelters for dundees rough sleepers","story":"The boss

hot drinks to five people we found rough sleeping in the city.“One lad had been ejected from a hostel on Friday and due to rain on Sunday night his blanket was soaking wet and he was very low in

Norman said that in the early hours of Monday morning the charity’s outreach team found a lad sleeping rough in the West End of the city.“As he was freezing cold we got him into our warm van, gave him a hot chocolate and sleeping bag.“We contacted Dundee City Council’s homeless services and due to complications which we can’t ulge they were unable to offer immediate support.“We arranged for him to

My house is one of the worst affected, the ceilings don’t even touch the walls anymore.“My husband and children have had to move in with family because of health issues so I’m living here alone.” vw, px\"  Subsidence occurs when the ground under a property collapses, or sinks lower, taking some of the building’s foundations with it.This puts strain on the home’s structure as one side sinks, causing cracks to appear. Many of the residents have also reported damp problems and cold flats.It is understood the four options on the table are for external repairs, micropiling and ground beams, mass concrete underpinning and demolishing the buildings then rehoming the residents. All options other than external repairs would result in residents being rehomed, with the building work displacing people in the area for up to five years.Micropiling and ground beams – where strengthening rods are drilled into the ground – would take five years to complete, mass concrete underpinning four years, and external works six to eight weeks. vw, px\"  It would take around  weeks to totally demolish the buildings.John and Marilyn Davidson have lived on Errol Place for  years and believe demolition is the only option.John said: “We have had damp in the bedrooms. The conditions of the houses are awful.“They should demolish them – they’re that bad.”The couple said they have been plagued with issues like windows and doors “twisting”.Even when their front door was closed they could see outside through a crack next to the hinge.John added: “They aren’t worth anything. We’ve been here  years and the only work that’s been done is external painting.“The stairwells were meant to be redone but they never have been. The doorway is twisted and so are the window frames. There are times we can hardly lock them.“They’re not worthwhile living in.”Marilyn added: “I wish they would make up their minds about what they are doing.”Another resident, James Gray, , who lives on Errol Street, said he was one of the lucky ones, having avoided issues like damp in his home. He too, however, would like to see the buildings demolished. vw, px\"  He said: “They said it will take four or five years to do all the underpinning, and they can rehome everyone. I must be one of the lucky ones. It’s a cold flat, there’s a draught from the windows, but I haven’t had any damp.“There’s nothing concrete been decided. There’s seven houses empty, the one next door has been empty for two years. It’s a shame when there’s people homeless.“I’ve lost my family over the past couple of years so I want to move. I was going to go away for a month in January with my daughter and son-in-law but then all of this happened and I couldn’t.“They’ve said they would move us into a like-for-like house.”Agnes Brands, , who lives in Errol Place, said she would like to stay in her flat. She added: “They are very cold.“I have had the roof leaking before for a while. I’ve been here  years. I’m not able to move. Some of the people want to flit but I’m not able.“Will the council help you out  I can’t move my stuff.”Councillor Sandra Macdonald, who represents the area, stressed that the homes were not a danger to the residents.She said: “They’re safe for habitation – we wouldn’t have people living in them otherwise.“There was a consultation with residents in September and as far as I’m aware they were split half and half.“Some want to stay because they have friends and family.“Anecdotally older folk want to stay in their homes.“At the end of the day I don’t think doing nothing is an option – I don’t think anyone wants to just mend and repair.“It has to be either concrete underpinning or demolishing the buildings.“It has to be the best decision for the residents and our tenants as well and the council’s finances.”Cllr Macdonald said the decision will be taken tomorrow but it would take a “while” to negotiate with homeowners.She added: “There’s a complete range of tenants who are all wanting to know what is going to happen in the longer term.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll girls secure scottish cup win","story":"Bruce WestUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHere’s a novelty question.

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"piping hot performance ayr stars","story":"NewsPiping hot performance from Ayr starsAyr Pipe Band Society took to the stage to support the world-renowned bagpipe band Red Hot Chilli Pipers.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  FEB NewsAyr Pipe Band Society gear up to support Red Hot Chilli Pipers at Ayr Town Hall \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPiping stars joined together to wow crowds at a top show in Ayr’s Town Hall.

such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt

their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for

months.\"The grieving process for me started  months before Matt died as the two of us came to terms with the idea that we were not going to have the le together we planned.\"I spent a lot of time listening to a playlist we compiled which represented our  years together.ldquoNow I am doing my best to give our children the childhood we had planned together.ldquoI am so proud of Oscar and Chloe for being part of the Wear A Hat Day campaign.\"It means so much to my family and me to help contribute towards a cure, so itrsquos an honour to have them take part.

Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of  than any other cancer yet, historically, just one percent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease Brain Tumour Research is proud to be changing this.ldquoThe sad truth is that brain tumours are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age and this means the impact on families is enormous.

midpoint of winter, half way between the shortest day and the spring equinox.For Christians it has a particularly special meaning as it was  days after the birth of Jesus and the day when, according to Jewish custom, his grateful parents took him to the temple to give thanks to God.We believe that Jesus is the light of the world who will guide us through our own dark times.Many customs have grown around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge.

That is exactly what she is doing. For the last two years she has put Scotlandrsquos constitutional issues to the side and pushed for Scotland and the UK to remain within the customs union and single market. All and any analysis I have read has given that outcome as being in the best economic interests of the UK and Scotland, but Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish Government and Scotlandrsquos Parliament have all been dismissed with contempt.The May Government is only interested in the Tory party and the DUP. The EU has proved extremely flexible in dealing with Mmember territories in or out of the EU, so it was possible Scotland and Northern Ireland could have had a dferent status to England Wales but was never asked. Indeed it has been reported that London insisted to the EU that Scotland be denied sharing in any dferentiation on offer to others.Mr Redfern advocates for what he calls the ldquoMay compromise: trouble is that Theresa May changes the parameters of her deal on a daily basis. Donrsquot believe me ndash ask her own Tory MPs. It is the Tories who have led us to this clf edge, and it will be the Tories who tip us into the abyss. Scotland voted to stay in the EU but has zero status or leverage within the UK ldquoUnion. Ireland is respected and her interests are being protected in the EU Union. The dference is stark and should be an example to any Scot with an ounce of gumption.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.ROBIN Gilmourdraws a somewhat simplistic comparison between Irelands long struggle for freedom from British rule and the UKs vote to leave the European Union.He is correct to state that the Republic of Ireland, over hundreds of years, fought against domination by Britain and eventually won its independence. However, Britains partition of Ireland, designed to keep the bulk of the Unionist population and heavy industry under the UK flag, sowed the seeds for future conflict in the north of Ireland.Our present vexatious issue with the Irish protocol has only arisen because the UKs decision to depart from the EU leaves Northern Ireland as, obviously, thanks to the partition of , the only part of the UK that shares a border with an EU country.The Irish Government and the EU are trying to work together with Theresa May and her Government to avoid future loss of le and conflict in Northern Ireland by ensuring that there is no hard border, now, and in the future.The only obstruction to Britain arriving at a solution at present appears to be from those who see the people on the island of Ireland as an irrelevance and a hindrance to a clean break with Brussels,despite  per cent of people in Northern Ireland voting to remain.Mr Gilmours exasperation displays an age-old condescending British attitude towards the Irish that I had hoped had evaporated into the mists of history. As he himself says, Ireland is an independent sovereign nation on a par with Britain.

Many of us would agree that Network Rail needs to be in the control of Scotland so that we can have a truly joined-up approach to these issues,\" said Mr Harvie.\"But we cannot wait for that. That is no excuse for not taking action now.\"Three months ago when many of these failures were already being regularly reported, the Government voted against using the breakpoint in the ScotRail franchise next year.\"If the Government werent convinced then, I think they should be convinced now that that option must remain on the table.\"Surely the Deputy First Minister wont rule that option out because doing so would give Abellio a free pass to continue failing.\"The Government must work on the assumption that a public sector bidder may be needed from next year\".Mr Swinney said that the Scottish Government does not consider the performance of ScotRail to be acceptable and reiterated that a remedial notice had been issued to Abellio on December .The notice requires the operator to state how it will address current issues by submitting a remedial plan by Febuary .The deputy First Minister agreed with Mr Harvies assertion that Network Rail should be devolved and said that development work to establish a public sector bid was underway.\"Under the current UK legislation, the requirement to tender the franchise would still remain which then opens up the possibility, which we have now secured as a Government, to bring forward a competitive public sector bid in that context.\"Development work is underway about how to advance the concept of a competitive public sector bid. That work is being taken forward by the Transport Secretary in dialogue with David MacBrayne Ltd who weve invited to take forward some of that work.\"The Government believes fundamentally we have got to have an efficient public rail network that meets the needs of iniduals within Scotland, that acts in the public interest, that delivers services that members of the public are looking for.\"Thats what our immediate short-term action is focused on achieving and its why were open to developing a competitive public sector bid within the context of the existing UK legislation within which we have to operate.\"Labour Transport spokesman Colin Smyth said that his party would continue to campaign for public ownership of the railways.Mr Smyth said: \"Labour wants a publicly owned ScotRail but our plans to exercise the break clause in Abellios contract were blocked at Holyrood by the SNP and the Tories.\"With passengers facing rip-off fares and substandard service, well continue to make the case for public ownership of our public transport - unlike the SNP, which has handed Abellio a licence to fail.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9359997.jpg?type=article-full","title":"labour-party-facing-exodus-over-jeremy-corbyns-brexit-stance","story":"The Labour leader has written to the Prime Minister setting out five demands that need to be met to get his partys support for a Brexit deal.:Labour shting from Opposition to the facilitator of a Tory Brexit - Ian BlackfordBut Owen Smith, his former leadership rival, said he was considering his position in the party and hit out at the prospect of Labour MPs being asked to back a deal which he said would damage livelihoods.Other pro-EU MPs also criticised Mr Corbyns plan, claiming it was a change to the partys policy of keeping open the prospect of a second referendumLabour couldnt force a general election.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer insisted the move by Mr Corbyn did not take the option of a so-called Peoples Vote off the table.In his letter to Mrs May, the Labour leader set out five demands:- A permanent customs union to deliver frictionless trade and help avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland- Close alignment with the single market, including shared institutions and obligations- Participation in EU agencies and funding programmes,- Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases.On a visit to Worcester, Mr Corbyn told reporters: \"Half of our trade is with Europe.

months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

It was formerly known as KRG Industries.The business provides precision machining services to a number of clients in the oil and gas, aerospace and defence, rail and food sectors.The existing management team of KRG will lead the company with Gerry Hughes holding the role of managing director.

I am pleased the existing management team led by Gerry Hughes will remain with the business and take it forward.”On Monday, it emerged that Proserv had expanded its portfolio by purchasing SGC Metering from energy ­services provider Petrofac for an undisclosed sum.SGC designs and manufactures flow computer metering systems to gauge metrics associated with hydrocarbon production and ­enable key calculations.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities. That may be the one silver lining to emerge from the Brexit process, whether there are any more remains to be seen.Stuart Murdoch is a solicitor advocate and partner at Burness Paull LLP©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

I still remember when she put up the Christmas decorations.\"They were so good I just kept them up for a long time! I was so chuffed when she came to visit me on that last trip up here. It was wonderful to see her so happy with her boyfriend.\"Natashas friend Michelle Chalmers, who runs MAC Equestrian, said: \"All three of the Galpin sisters kept their horses with us over many years.\"When we moved to Laggan in  and started up our business they were our first clients and were with us until they moved south.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

A no deal Brexit would result in the introduction of tarfs, estimated to cost UK wine importing businesses over £ million a year.ldquoThe introduction of no deal Brexit tarfs would be a double blow for wine businesses after the Chancellor elected to single out wine for a duty rise at the Autumn Budget.From February  the duty on a bottle of wine went up by p, but add a tarf to the duty rise and VAT and this means an average priced bottle of wine, which today costs £., will cost £. in the event of no deal.Read more: How will Brexit affect your travel plans  This is an extra p a bottle more than consumers paid before the referendum result when an average priced bottle of wine was £..There could be some positive benefits for British vineyards however.It is believed that British wines will seem less expensive than its European counterparts as retailers wonrsquot be forced to hike prices because of rate or tarfs.However, British vineyards could be hit with the lack of skilled workers from the EU and vital agricultural funding streams.

The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will. That’s nice, and the traditional music community are great.” Gradam recipients, who represent the crème de la crème of traditional music and song, will be joined in live performances on stage by their own special musical guests, including Irish fiddler Paddy Glackin, Michael McCague and multi-instrumentalist Sinéad Egan, to name but a few. A range of VIP guest presenters will also take to the stage last year, actor Stephen Rea and President Michael D. Higgins were amongst the VIP guests at the event.Tickets for the February th TG Gradam Ceoil Awards , priced from £., are available from www.waterfront or +  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ulster u21 club football tournament","story":"Carryduff -St Brigid#s -From David Mohan in CregganDANIEL Guinness was the toast of Carryduff on Sunday as his late point sent his side through to the final of the Ulster U Club Football Tournament at Creggan at the expense of South Belfast neighbours St Brigid#s.This unique local derby between the champions of Antrim and Down lived up to the pre-match hype as the teams served up a thrilling game with some fine scores and plenty of drama with the result in doubt right up until the last kick of the ball when Rory Brolly#s late effort from distance sailed wide as he tried to find an equaliser for the Malone club.In the end, Carryduff probably just about deserved their win as they were a little better in front of the posts with Ronan Beatty notching six points and having a hand in others to take the man-of-the-match award, while Owen McCabe was also in top form for the Down side.St Brigid#s had big games from Patrick Finnegan and Peter Webb, but they just found their scores a little harder to come by, although they certainly couldn#t be faulted for effort as they stuck to the task and almost forced extra-time at the end.Carryduff were first on the board from a Rory Anderson free after three minutes, but St Brigid#s enjoyed a fine spell with Webb kicking a magnicent score in response off his left boot, while Peter Henvey, Rory Brolly and James Smith added points in quick succession to move the Antrim champions three clear after just eight minutes.They would have to wait another  minutes to add to their tally as Carryduff settled into the game and they were on terms soon after when Josh Connery sold a couple of dummies to make a little space and he drilled a fantastic low shot into the net.John McGough followed with a pointed  and Carryduff almost had a second goal straight away, but Pearse Laverty#s shot flashed across the face of goal and wide.Ronan Beatty opened his account from a free on  minutes to make it - to -, while St Brigid#s ended a barren spell with Webb kicking another beauty.The teams went score-for-score for the remainder of the half with Beatty and Connery to the fore for Carryduff, while Webb and Smith raised flags for St Brigid#s as the Down side went in at the break leading - to -.A Laverty free two minutes after the restart extended the gap to three for Carryduff two minutes after the break, but St Brigid#s were level on  minutes when Patrick Finnegan was trailed back inside the area as he was about to pull the trigger and a penalty was awarded. Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37792645.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Jim_Wells.jpg","title":"dup meeting on partys brexit stance did not discuss impact on northern ireland says jim wells","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said the mechanics of how the UK departed - including for a solution to the Irish border - were not discussed. Nor was a presentation on the strengths or weaknesses of leaving or remaining done.\"There didnt need to be because there was such a huge body of experience of people around that table that knew exactly the problems the EU was causing to our economy,\" he said.\"Once we established the principle of leaving Europe the modalities would work out later... we were just concentrating on the getting out from under the yoke of the EU.\"\"Frankly we could see little positive in remaining.\"Mr Wells - who has been ostracised by the DUP having had the party whip removed for speaking out against its leadership also said that while there was currently \"uncertainty\" around the UKs departure he was confident in \"five or six years time we will look back and say we were right\".The DUP said the sanctions against Mr Wells remained in place and he was speaking in a personal view and not representing the party in any form.\"It is unclear what meeting Mr Wells is speaking about,\" a DUP spokeswoman added, \"The Party Officers and DUP Executive Members set the policy of the party.”Sinn Fein said it was more evidence of the DUP chasing a \"Brexit fantasy\".We made right decision and each day we get more confident.FacebookTwitterVeteran DUP man Wells made the revelations on the BBC Stephen Nolan show. He said he was at the DUP policy meeting - along with all the other MLAs and MPs - which took the decision to back leave for the  poll.He was asked what was discussed, as there was no debate on how leaving the EU would affect the border, businesses or farmers.The South Down MLA said the meeting concentrated on the principle of what side to take and there had been an \"entirely negative\" experience among the party - which has held seats in the European parliament for decades - saying many saw the EU as \"senseless bureaucracy, interference, meddling and control\".It was put to him that given the partys experience in the RHI scandal, would it not have been better to examine all the data and anaylsis in detail and it would have been healthier to consider the merits in remaining.He added: \"We didnt have the depth of knowledge on the RHI scheme that they had on the EU.\"Mr Wells said there  was not a single voice of dissent. He was askedformer Finance Minister Simon Hamilton had spoken up. Mr Hamilton has continually refused to answer how he voted in the referendum.Mr Wells said he had never seen the party as united on one issue as they are on Brexit and there was unanimity in backing leave. The former health minister also said he \"struggled\" to meet any unionists who advocated remain having knocked thousands of doors during the last election campaign. Although he did concede there would be a \"small number\" of DUP members on the remain side.\"Im talking about the unionist community. Areas like Kilkeel because of the fishing industry I was genuinely shocked by the force of resentment to the EU.\"He said many farmers were \"fed up\" with EU bureaucracy and the \"nay-sayers of the Farmers Union\" did not speak for those in South Down. He said the burden of rules and regulations from the EU was costing farmers a fortunate, citing the nitrates directive which, he explained, meant farmers had to invest in slurry tanks for winter time storage as opposed to spreading the material.He said it was a very expensive rule for farmers to adhere to but admitted he did not knowthe directive should be scrapped orit was beneficial to restrict the spread of nitrates in soil.Whats surprising you is that a party would have such an anonymous view on such an important subject.FacebookTwitterThe DUP politician of  years was asked thatduring the meeting any numbers were discussed or data shared on how a leave vote would impact the local economy.He said within the DUP the \"universal view\" based on decades of experience was leaving the EU would \"ultimately benefit all of the economy of the UK and Northern Ireland\".\"In the same way we have never had a statistical analysis of remaining as part of the Union, the DUP at its core we are a unionist party,\" he continued.\"Its not aswe were looking to join the EU, we had been in it in  years. We had direct statistical background information as to the impact it was currently having... and the decision was unanimous.\"And there has not been a raised eyebrow since despite all the facts and information we have been exposed to since .. we made the right decision.\"We feel vindicated and we see the attitude of the EU which has been so belligerent in negotiations we were right to try to get out of the institutions as quickly as possible.\"Apart from UKIP there is no more united party on this issue. And that has been the heart of the party since . nobody who voted for us in the last  years would be in any doubt that the DUP would vote enthusiastically for leaving the EU.\"No one has said we made the wrong decision. We are not having a guilt phase here, we are not worried or concerned. We made the right decision and each day we get more confident.\"In response the DUP said: \"In June , the Party informed all local media editors that the Party whip had been removed from Jim Wells. That remains the case. The operational note also stated: “Any comments made by Mr Wells during broadcast or print press interviews are his personal opinions and should not be quoted by your organisation as representing the views of the Party.”The statement added: \"It is unclear what meeting Mr Wells is speaking about.  The Party Officers and DUP Executive Members set the policy of the party.”"},{"url":null,"title":"farmer proposes with message visible from space","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These standard quality checks are carried out every three months, in line with UK best practice.The Western Trust said it immediately set up a review team, alerted the Public Health Agency and Department of Health and initiated the review process.  As a result of the review, a total of  women have been asked to arrange repeat smear test with their GP.Of the  women affected,  of them are from the Western Trust area,  women from the Belfast and South Eastern Trust areas and  women from the Republic of Ireland.Dr Dermot Hughes, Medical Director of the Western Trust, said: “The women affected will have received letters inviting them to contact their GP to arrange a repeat smear test. This does not necessarily mean that the results of their initial test were wrong the repeat test is a precautionary measure to provide reassurance that all women are being followed up appropriately.“I understand that this may cause worry and inconvenience for the women affected and I sincerely apologise for this. I would like to reassure everyone that the samples that were reviewed were a small percentage of those screened and reported between April  and June .“The stringent quality checks that are in place have reassured us that it was only a certain number of tests within this timeframe that were required to be re-examined.” ‘Le-saving’Sinn Féin Councillor Caoimhe McKnight has said her party has requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust.The Derry councillor recently encouraged local women to have regular Smear Tests as she reflected on her own experience with the “le-saving” procedure.Cllr. McKnight said: “I can speak from experience when I say that a Smear Test could literally save your le.  When living in Scotland at the age of , which is the age there at which you are eligible for a smear, I received the notication of my eligibility and advised to avail of it.“But like many young women I put it off for a couple of months before finally going for the test.  When I tell you how grateful I am that I made the decision to have the test it is no exaggeration.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It was luckythat I made the decision to have the test as they found abnormal cells.  I dread to think what I may have been toldI had to wait until the age of  before being tested.“After treatment and a few yearly smears everything is now fine and I am now in the normal  year test cycle.”She said it will be a “distressing” time for the women recalled but urged them all to contact their GPs to schedule a repeat smear test as soon as possible.\"While the Western Trust have said that this is a precautionary measure it will still cause concern and worry so it is important the affected women do not face undue delay in receiving a repeat test.\"In June ,  women in Belfast and Newtownabbey were also invited to attend for repeat smear test after the Public Health Agency were made aware of concerns identied in April that year.\"As I understand it, the Western Trust’s review of cervical smear tests concerned those in April and June , but it is not clearthere is a connection with what happened in Belfast and Newtownabbey in June and this recent action by the Western Trust.\"Sinn Féin have requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust and we will be raising these concerns directly with them,\" she added.‘Mistakes’Meanwhile, SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins told women to call the Western Trust helpline, to allay any concerns.Cllr Dobbins commented: “This is not the first time mistakes have been made in regards to cervical screening laboratories lessons should and must be learnt from issues both in the South and in England.“Undoubtedly this recall will be a cause of concern for many women. However, I must stress the fact that only a fraction of those tested between April to June  were affected and will receive letters this week to arrange a repeat test with their GP.“This does not necessarily indicate that initial results were incorrect, rather the recall is a precautionary measure intended to allay concerns.”The Western Trust has advised the affected women thatthey have any concerns or want further information, they should contact the Western Trust’s Laboratory Department on   , from Tuesday  February to Wednesday  February between am to pm."},{"url":null,"title":"walled city story light derrys tower museum","story":"This weekend all eyes will be on the Tower Museum in Derry as the story of the Walls comes alive through a series of images projected onto the building’s historic façade over the weekend.The projections are part of a year-long series of events celebrating the th anniversary of the completion of the city’s iconic Walls, organised by Derry City and Strabane District Council and its partners The Honourable, The Irish Society - the builders and owners of the Walls - and the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division.The images feature a series of beautul hand sketches by local artist Seán Ó Brógáin commissioned by the Council during the th year anniversary of the Plantation.

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened. Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

However, the Irish government, facing a growing revolt on the matter from TDs, says the bill would breach EU law and is opposing it. The Control of Economic ActivityBill  does not specically mention Israel but would make it an offence for a person to “import or sell goods or services originating in an occupied territory or to extract resources from an occupied territory in certain circumstances”.The bill passed through the Upper House of the Irish Parliament, the Seanad, by - and - in two votes in November. Last month, a further vote in the lower house, the Dail, saw it supported - with three abstentions. It has a further three stages to go in the Dail after which it would have to be signed by the Irish president to become law. Some observers suggest it is unlikely he would, due to government opposition.DUP MLA William Humphrey said: “It seems bizarre that the European enthusiasts in the Dail would try to pass a bill boycotting Israeli goods when such a move is not compatible with EU trade law.“Israeli technology and goods are embedded completely in our everyday lives and those proposing boycotts ignore the practical and economic realities of such a move. “If the Republic of Ireland wants to turn its back on the opportunities of working with Israel I would extend an invitation to the Israeli legislators to come to Northern Ireland. I know many businesses would welcome the opportunity such a visit would bring.”In a speech to TDs on January , Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the bill would place the Republic in breach of EU trade law.“Trade is an exclusive competence of the European Union,” he said. “We are not in a position to raise a barrier and declare that it is prohibited to bring to Ireland, for sale or personal use, goods which enter the EU legally, and are freely circulating where in the single market.”The bill will not signicantly impact on Israeli settlements, he said. However, it could lead the Republic into legal challenges, signicant EU penalties and paying damages to those with economic interests in the Israeli settlements.Brexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy WilsonPolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Such legislation would also undermine the Republic’s credibility to influence Middle East issues at EU and UN level, he said.And it could create conflicts for US companies in the Republic and Irish companies in the US, he said, because the US Congress has been considering legislation which forbids companies based in America from cooperating with Israeli trade bans. “For these reasons, no responsible party of government could support this bill and this government must and will oppose it,” Mr Coveney said.Opposing the bill in the Jerusalem Post, Irish Jew and former Irish minister for justice and defence, Alan Shatter, said none of the proponents of the bill in the Irish Parliament had mentioned ongoing terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians or the support by Hamas and Hezbollah for Iran’s “genocidal objective of destroying the Israeli state”.Although not much emphasized, he said, it is also clear from the bill’s terminology that it applies to any goods or services originating from any Israeli presence in east Jerusalem and on the Golan Heights.In addition, he said, Sinn Fein’s enthusiastic support for the bill is “payback for the training given by the PLO in terrorism and bomb making” to the IRA.And slamming Fianna Fail’s support for the bill, he noted that in the s the party “denied residential visas to many German Jews trying to escape Nazi Germany and, postwar, to Holocaust survivors”. He believes that the bill’s passage “may grind to a halt”the government considers it too expensive to implement and designates it as “a money bill”. If enacted, Mr Shatter added, it may also have no immediate effectMr Coveney declines to implement it, although this could be reversed by any minister of foreign affairs who might succeed him.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

I think he’d be wasting quite a lot of someone ’s money.”New Presbyterian moderator calls for ‘common sense’ over Irish language act Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

I wanted to do something which would allow me to combine the flexibility of family with work and give me a good balance. I also wanted to develop and use my skill sets.”From her initial idea, Eveva was born – setting her up as a virtual assistant. “I saw a niche in the market for this type of work with small businesses and self- employed people who simply do not have the time to manage the tasks themselves,” she explained.“I offer a range of services, particularly in digital marketing, where I manage email marketing campaigns and social media pages for clients. I joined a few local networking groups, where I have since met my first clients and I am now starting to see referrals come through.” she explains.Eve turned her vision into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme, which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. “Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality. “Workspace Enterprises helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis.

But also we recognise that it has been politicised in many ways, and we think that discussion needs to be depoliticised for the benefit and the good of the whole of our land.“I think we need to be sensitive, particularlygetting an Irish language act was too costly and bureaucratic and we need to measure that against hospital beds and all those aspects. So from that point of view, I think we need a little bit of common sense in the discussion.”He went on to add: “I think we just need to be careful within the breadth of what that encompasses.“Certainly we’ve to value the Irish language in a way that those who do think it’s important [are able to] recognise that and can see that.“But I think there have to be constraints and there has to be a bit of common sense in just how much it actually costs, and that I suppose is the other angle other people come at it from.”Lord Trimble raises £k in two days in legal action over backstopBrexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy Wilson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers.

What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
