The best way to stop the leak would be to shut both main steam stops, which would halt the leak almost instantly.But that would come at a cost – a very big cost. If he did that, the nuclear reactor would be disabled and Revenge would be crippled, dead in the water.‘We would have to surface and signal for a tug,’ Thompson recalls in a book he has just published about his service in this most secretive branch of the Royal Navy.‘Unthinkable. Revenge was a Polaris missile submarine on Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrol. She was the country’s duty guardian. Surfacing and calling for a tug would mean breaching one of the country’s most highly guarded secrets – where we were.’          NUCLEAR CRISIS: Senior engineer Eric Thompson aboard HMS RevengeHad that happened, the political ramifications would have been huge. With the then Labour Government facing noisy and insistent calls for unilateral disarmament, the image of a crippled nuclear-armed submarine being towed back from waters somewhere near the Soviet Union would have been humiliating and would have increased calls for an abandonment of Britain’s nuclear deterrent.The stakes for Thompson could not have been higher. He was damned one way and possibly killed the other. But then he had an idea, a way that could perhaps save both lives and national prestige. It would be a gamble, but he had nothing to lose.LAST month marked the 50th anniversary of the Royal Navy’s Submarine Service taking on the enormous burden of carrying Britain’s nuclear deterrent.On June 15, 1968, HMS Resolution slipped out of her dock at Faslane on the Clyde to start her first patrol. Resolution would be the first of four submarines in her class, and between them, from 1968 to 1996, they carried out an unbroken series of 229 Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrols.For the entire duration, they were ready to fire their Polaris nuclear missiles at any target in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc at just 15 minutes’ notice. It was an extraordinary achievement, and it required extraordinary men and machines.Today, that duty is being carried out by the Navy’s four ageing Vanguard class submarines equipped with the Trident nuclear ballistic missile system, the fate of which is, of course, a political hot potato.Iain Ballantyne, author of The Deadly Trade: The Complete History Of Submarine Warfare From Archimedes To The Present, explains: ‘Paradoxically, the only way for Britain to have a voice in multilateral nuclear disarmament may be for it to build the new Dreadnought class submarines to give it the weight to demand an end to the nuclear balance of terror.‘What is deeply worrying is the current situation where Theresa May’s Government – and preceding Labour, Tory and Coalition administrations – have so weakened the nation’s conventional deterrent forces that nuclear weapons become the first resort – rather than the last resort – if the nation is faced with an existential threat from a nuclear-armed foe, such as Russia.’          Some crew members dressed in drag for the ship’s revues. Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoesIf there was some seriously bad news, it was withheld by the captain until the end of the patrol. Eric Thompson once had to inform a chief petty officer his wife had left him, and to another, he had to break the news that his father had died. But there was once worse. On the night before Repulse finished one of its patrols, Commander Bob Seaward had to summon one of his crew to inform him his wife and child had been killed in a car crash seven weeks before.‘After more than ten weeks on patrol, that poor man would have been overjoyed at the prospect of a reunion with his wife and child the following day,’ Thompson observes, ‘only to be told they had been killed.’Deal of the century: UK defence firm BAE wins contract worth...Ex-head of the Armed Forces lashes Theresa May for...Surveillance splurge: Government spends $7 BILLION on six...Bomb squad is called to BAE Systems after suspicious item is...Share this articleIn order to break the monotony of life on board, various entertainments were laid on. Of course, the Polaris subs operated well before Kindles and tablets, and today the entertainments seems almost quaint.Men played games such as Ludo and cribbage, or watched one of the 56 films brought on board. Quizzes were a staple activity and some aspiring disc jockeys even used the sub’s sound system to inflict their favourite music on crewmates. Fitness fanatics could use rowing and cycling machines, lift weights and even play table tennis. More cerebral types studied for public exams.Even plays and revues were staged. The exhibition in Gosport shows that on one patrol, a group called the Polaris Players staged a show called A Deep Distraction, featuring morris dancing, a barber shop quartet, and even a group describing themselves as ‘Scottish opera’.Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoes.Eric Thompson recalls one such ‘lady’ being so attractive that pin-ups of him appeared all over the submarine. ‘It’s frightening what eight weeks without female company can do to a man’s judgment,’ Thompson reflects.Such antics were not the only eccentricities that crew members displayed. One commanding officer was known to take a sports jacket and flannel trousers on every patrol and after the Sunday morning service, he would put them on and have a picnic in a private corner of the submarine.Banter and high jinks were also staple fare. Men could find themselves unable to get out of their bunks because they had been trapped inside by a wall of parcel tape. Cigars – yes, smoking was allowed – were sometimes fitted with exploding tips. Sleeping bags were placed into the rubbish compactor and returned to their owners as tight cubes.Naturally, with so many confined in such a small space for weeks, personalities could clash and tempers could flare, but with training and officers keeping discipline, there is no account of things getting out of control. In the main, it appears the men looked out for each other, with many performing selfless tasks.One of the most remarkable in the eyes of Eric Thompson was the supreme act of valour carried out by a crewmate called Tom Chittenden, who went scuba ing in the sewage tank to unlock the valve that released its contents overboard. With all the toilets blocked, had he not succeeded, the results would have been unthinkable. ‘He should have received an honour for that,’ Thompson writes.Had Chittenden become ill as a result of his e, he would have been treated by the submarine’s doctor, qualified to carry out many life-saving operations, as well as keeping his eye on the mental health of the crew.However, if a crewman was critically ill, he would have to survive until the end of the patrol. If he did not, his body would be stored in the food freezers. Nothing, not even life, was more important than maintaining the country’s nuclear deterrent.Of course, it was that which united these men – their exceptional role as the Prime Minister’s trigger if he or she wanted to launch a nuclear strike against, in all likelihood, the Soviet Union. The submarine had to be ready at all times to fire its missiles and to keep the crew sharp, weapons systems readiness tests were carried out at random.When the orders for such tests came in, the crew had no way of knowing whether the test was the real thing, and it was not until the senior officers had decoded the full order that the crew would become aware they were not in fact consigning millions of people to their deaths.It is chilling to reflect that each submarine had more firepower than all the ammunition expended in the Second World War. Of course, no such order has ever been issued for real. However, what was frighteningly real was the situation faced by Eric Thompson back in June 1978, with the critical leak of high-pressure steam.With just seconds to spare, Thompson decided to take a gamble on what he later called an ‘obscure dockyard procedure never used at sea’. Too complex to explain here, Thompson’s gamble involved the equivalent of ‘emptying the domestic hot water tank straight into the toilet’.‘For what seemed like an eternity, nothing happened,’ he recalled.‘The roaring of the steam continued. The humidity was unbearable. Then there was a mighty whoosh down the starboard steam range behind my back. \u0027It was like letting go the neck of an inflated balloon. The boiler had been deflated. The roar of steam had stopped.’Although crisis had been averted, for the next eight weeks, the maximum speed was severely reduced and there would be no extra power to deal with any emergencies. Thankfully, none came.What Thompson soon discovered was that one of the crew had tried to squeeze through the jungle of pipework through the scalding steam to shut down the critical valve, but had been unable to make it.In doing so, he ripped his back open. Thompson recommended him for a medal and the crewman, James ‘Bungy’ McWilliams, was awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal.Although there was no chance of a nuclear meltdown or the Polaris missiles detonating, it had been a close-run thing. It was the nearest – as far as we know – that our nuclear ballistic submarines have come to a major disaster.Meanwhile, the four Resolution class submarines are lying in a dock at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth, waiting to be decommissioned in a process costing many millions that will last until 2040.Once the secret killers of the deep, they can now be easily seen with Google Earth. It seems an ignominious ending for these awesome instruments of Armageddon.On Her Majesty’s Nuclear Service, by Eric Thompson, is published by Casemate Publishers, priced £19.99.

Mr Musk is thought to be behind the plans for the Graveney batteryUnlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag.The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof.The proposed development would include the world’s biggest battery – almost three times as large as the current biggest, built last year by Tesla tycoon Elon Musk in South Australia.This has a capacity of 129 megawatt hours. The Graveney battery, also likely to be built by Mr Musk, will be capable of storing 350MWhr, with no fewer than 7,660 inidual battery units.California moves to require solar panels on all new homes by...Share this articleIn all, the battery units will cover an area the size of a further 15 football pitches.The battery is crucial to the scheme’s profitability.By storing power generated during sunny periods in the middle of the day when demand and the changing electricity ‘spot price’ are low, the operators will be able to sell it to the National Grid at other times – such as the evening – when no solar power is being generated and prices are much higher.The project is so large it will not be governed by the usual democratic planning process.Instead, it will fall to Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark to decide whether to approve it as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project.          The Graveney battery, also likely to be built by Elon Musk, will be capable of storing 350MWhrThe developers, a partnership between Hive Energy and Wirsol, part of a firm based in Germany, boast that with a maximum output of 350MW – seven times the size of any existing solar farm in Britain – it will ‘power over 110,00 homes’.However, they admit it will produce power only about 11 per cent of the time. The output of the nearby Medway gas-fired power station is 735MW, but this is continuous.Its site covers 15 acres – enough for just ten football pitches.When The Mail on Sunday visited Graveney last week, the only sounds at the site’s edge were the tweeting of skylarks and the rustle of grass in the wind.A huge and rare bird of prey, a marsh harrier, from one of the nesting pairs that now live on what may become the solar farm, flapped its wings in the distance, cruising the shoreline.The scheme has managed to unite environmentalists against it – from groups that would normally favour solar energy.Vicky Ellis, from the Kent branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We support renewable energy in the right place – such as on roofs, industrial and farm buildings.\u0027We don’t support trashing the countryside and losing productive farmland for the sake of chasing a profit.‘This is one of the most protected and fragile landscapes in Kent, of international importance, with some of the best and rarest bioersity in Europe, and it will be impossible to mitigate the loss of tranquillity and unique habitat.           The Cleve Hill sites 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus          Campaigners are fighting to block a £400 million plan for a solar energy farm. Pictured the proposed site of the farm‘It is quite simply the industrialisation of rural Kent, depriving future generations of the chance to enjoy this wonderful and unique landscape.’Tim Valentine, speaking for the local Green Party, said: ‘We are very much in favour of renewable energy and the need to deploy it at scale.\u0027But it’s important we have the right schemes in the right places and we do not support a proposal that entails what amounts to a two-and-a-half-mile-long industrial roof over an area much loved by local people and surrounded by sites protected for wildlife.’Vinny Ganley, conservation adviser for the Kent Wildlife Trust, added: ‘This site has no precedent in its scale. \u0027We understand the need for solar power but we are very concerned about the impact it will have on wildlife.’A Hive Energy spokeswoman said the firm was working to minimise the scheme’s impact, claiming that sheep would graze among the panels.She added: ‘We are going beyond the legal requirements to engage with these organisations to have an ongoing dialogue to make this project agreeable.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/01/09/4DCC5FFC00000578-5905701-image-a-3_1530435055142.jpg","title":"Kim Pong North Korean leader watches production pink

Charity work: Christina\u0027s life changed after she was adopted in 1991 by a middle-class family in Sweden \u0027I gained confidence from hunting and scavenging and still recall my immense pride when I claimed my first bird, which we grilled over our tiny fire pit.\u0027The pair begged on the streets of Sao Paulo for money where they were spat at and called cockroaches.  And at the age of seven, she got in a fight with a street boy over a piece of bread from a bin.She wrote: \u0027Grappling on the ground, I heard a clinking sound next to me — a big piece of a glass bottle. I picked it up in my hand.\u0027He turned around, and without thinking, still moving, I jabbed that piece of glass at his belly as hard as I could.\u0027At first I felt nothing. Then my hand got warm. Blood gushed from the wound. I took the bread from the boy as he screamed and doubled over in pain.\u0027After I\u0027d run a fair way, I started eating. But then I started vomiting. The realisation of what I\u0027d done hit me.\u0027Ms Rickardsson heard the rumour days later that the boy had died.Eventually Ms Rickardsson was put in an orphanage, and in 1991 they were adopted by a middle-class family in Sweden.In 2015, she returned to Brazil for the first time in 24 years and tracked down her long-lost mother.Ms Rickardsson went on to found the children\u0027s charity, Coelho Growth Foundation.Speaking out has not been easy for the charity boss.

For speaking up and trying to give millions of street children a voice. For talking about integration and that we all have the same human value. \u0027But I will keep on doing my thing, I will continue to tell my story and the story of so many children around the world. \u0027I will keep on fighting for human rights and for equality in my own way, by giving lectures and keep on writing and addressing these problems. \u0027I will keep on walking!

The series began with some pictures she took at a pool in Barcelona. Using a Rolleiflex camera she shot from below to capture the modernist jut of ing boards against the clear blue sky.Laval was drawn to her “poolscapes”, she has said, to recreate some of the languorous summer joy of her growing up her pools are all about memory. The dazzling reflected light gives her pictures not only a painterly quality, but also the shimmer of half-recollection. Some of her images are\u0026nbspall about the exhilaration of water, splash and noise others, like this one, are more meditative. The best of them, like all the brightest days of summer, seem both real and imagined.As a later strand of the same series, Laval began taking photographs of abandoned or disused private pools in the US, pictures that seemed all about loss or mortality. You could perhaps convince yourself that you could feel that coda coming as you look at this picture. As David Hockney emphasised with his Californian pool scenes, there is always a dramatic narrative poolside, the before and after of taking the plunge. Given the dancing possibility of light implied in Laval’s picture, however, the figures on these ing boards resist that sudden change of state they are curiously static, each apparently in an inidual reverie. At some point, you imagine, they will have to drop into the water below, but for now they are stretching out the moment, not yet ready to submit to gravity.Poolscapes by Karine Laval is published later this month (Steidl, £35) "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2967beb41dafaa2c33d03b54ceddfaa59c8a2b74/0_280_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d3ae7b59dc1ddfb5b1353a699e7903","title":"were righting a wrong say the artists taking on youtube","story":"This week sees the final episode in the battle for the musicians fighting for a fairer dealThe music industry and YouTube are set to go head-to-head this week in a crucial vote in Brussels that could force the digital giant to pay billions of dollars in fees to popular artists such as Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Katy Perry. For years the music industry has argued that YouTube exploits the lack of legal protection around music videos being viewed on its service to pay minimal amounts to artists and labels. Artists and labelswon a key Brussels vote last month on the adoption of new copyright laws – putting them on the verge of forcing a dramatic shift in the balance of power away from the Silicon Valley giant – but on Thursday the European parliament will decide the victor.YouTube got a bloody nose in last month’s vote but its supporters are expected to gather the 76 MEPs needed to challenge that decision and force a vote by all 751 members of the parliament.“I think if you could pop a ‘provisional’ bottle of champagne then yes, that is what I’m doing,” said Martin Mills, founder of Beggars Group, which has represented artists including Adele, Radiohead and the xx. Warner Music’s chief, Steve Cooper, said its deal with YouTube last year was not a “free market” negotiation, and that the new European copyright law would force YouTube to the table.“The record industry has thoroughly negotiated deals with Spotify and Apple and so on but the problem with YouTube is that kind of discussion has not been possible,” says Mills. “For me, it is less about how much more the superstars will make than the power it will give working musicians, day-to-day artists, to strike deals to enable them to survive and be the artisan they want to be.”Taylor Swift has led the fight for artists to get a better share of revenues in the age of the digital music giants.In 2014, she pulled her music from Spotify, saying artists receive a tiny royalty per song playand has been the catalyst for the much better deals struck by record labels with Spotify in the past 18 months.The outlier has remained YouTube which has well over 1 billion users who regularly watch music videos. Its immense scale makes it not just financially important but critical in hit-making in the same way MTV was in the 1980s and 90s.“Despacito would probably not have become the global phenomenon it did without YouTube,” says Mark Mulligan, analyst at MIDiA Research. Last year, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s reggaeton hit took the world by storm becoming the most streamed song of all time. “YouTube is the number one place where young people discover music. If you are going to create global hits you need YouTube and it is becoming more important to musicians.”YouTube makes money from advertising and last year paid $856m (£650m) in royalties to music companies – an estimated 67 cents from each of its 1.3 billion music lovers annually. In the UK, record labels and artists earn more than double the royalties from the sale of 4.1m vinyl records than they did from the 25bn music videos watched on YouTube last year.Musician Billy Bragg says the battle against YouTube is less about the potential financial windfall that artists might get, and more about making sure the new digital music power players play fair.“We’ve all seen how, with the recent data protection legislation, the European Union has shifted power to the inidual online,” he says. “Now they’re seeking to do the same for artists. All we’re asking for is a level playing field … rebalancing the power between artists and the internet tech giants who are making massive profits while paying tiny royalties.”YouTube has made moves to mollify the industry launching a premium subscription service – two days before the crucial European vote – a move Jean-Michel Jarre, electro-pioneer and president of music body Cisac, has cynically called “indirect lobbying” to try to improve its image."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fd648524d97a12aa73d302cd96d410cf437bc/1_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503ac523343049412712cbedcf6736be","title":"quiz how well do you know business jargon","story":"Want to get soaked in a thought shower?

It is a small drawing hanging roughly at the height of your phone when you take a selfie. Mounted so that it “floats”, it depicts\u0026nbspGrenfell Tower burning. The image is drawn on the screen of an actual-size smartphone made of paper.The artist, Maartje Schalkx, tells me she drew with coloured pencils what she could see streaming on her own phone as the fire raged. A notification from a news site had alerted her and she was “awake for other people’s nightmare”. Drawing “was a way of making it more real, or holding on to it in some way. I just wanted to turn it into something more concrete,” she said. She drew the phone itself and made a screenprint.Schalkx’s Grenfell is the most diminutive of at least three works in the exhibition to reference the fire in London last year that killed 72 people. Item 202 in the catalogue, it is not for sale. Schalkx said that because of the subject “it didn’t feel right to sell it”.She “kind of” likes its corner position, small and intimate, like the work. “It’s a big event, but its emotions are very private to people.”Paper, medium of old for both art and journalism, may prove more enduring than digital platforms. A paper conservator by profession, Schalkx points to the strength and “good ageing characteristics” of the best papers, and contrasts them with the way old digital files stored in outmoded formats are sometimes no longer accessible.“Migrating birds eat our insects”“I went out for a bit and then I came back”“After a while we will stop thinking about it”Elsewhere in the academy, The Great Spectacle – 250 Years of the Summer Exhibition includes works by Sir David Wilkie that demonstrate his feel for news and nose for fame. The Village Politicians from 1806 has five men in an inn animatedly discussing “the radical views of the newspaper that lies across their table”. In Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Waterloo Despatch , ears cock, necks crane and eyes gleam as a newspaper reporting Wellington’s victory is read aloud to a crowd. Wilkie’s painting was so popular it required a protective barrier against the pressing crowd at the 1822 exhibition, which took place soon after Napoleon’s death.In 1874, Elizabeth Butler’s Calling the Roll After an Engagement, Crimea needed a policeman in the academy to hold back crowds. More famously known as The Roll Call, this sombre image of the fatigue, trauma and desolation of war was “Instagrammed” – the painting was taken to the palace for Queen Victoria to view it, to bedridden Florence Nightingale who reportedly approved of it, and 250,000 photo reproductions of the painting were sold.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39f36eb50de2d034a51c2bef5142bf530f41681/0_0_7138_4284/master/7138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9126e372c34200bd3b74d8e6a8ced6a","title":"unbelievable uk homes rent airbnb","story":"Eco pods, beach retreats and treehouses – just a few of the many unique properties for a home from home on your next UK break"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ef45c6df2836f248f2d74daac78d30d27abdfa/0_766_3414_2048/master/3414.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83cf2010470bd9350f3e9dfce0262ff1","title":"lady bird beanie feldstein caitlin moran build girl greta gerwig metoo","story":"Picture who might play the fictional alter ego of journalist and author Caitlin Moran, and a teetotal Jewish non-smoker from Los Angeles probably doesn’t spring immediately to mind. Yet Beanie Feldstein is exactly that and about to start shooting the lead in the film adaptation of Moran’s 2014 novel How to Build a Girl – the semi-autobiographical story of working-class Wolverhampton teenager Johanna Morrigan, who moves to London in the 90s to reinvent herself as a music journalist and “full-time lady sex adventurer”.It will be 25-year-old Feldstein’s first lead role. She made her acting debut aged nine in the ABC sitcom My Wife and Kids and went to theatre camp and appeared in school productions during her teens. Her first significant film role was in the debauched college comedy Bad Neighbors 2 alongside Seth Rogen and Zac Efron and she made her Broadway debut in last year’s sellout revival of Hello, Dolly!, starring Bette Midler. But it was her performance last year in writer-director Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird that confirmed Feldstein’s arrival. Playing Julie Steffans, the best friend of Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan), she ran away with most of the scenes she was in. The film was nominated for five Oscars.“As soon as we saw her in Lady Bird, we knew we’d both found Johanna and seen someone who was going to be a superstar,” says Caitlin Moran. “From the moment you see her, you root for her.Feldstein’s real first name is Elizabeth and the nickname Beanie came from a British nanny who called her “Elizabean”. “Sometimes I introduce myself to people and their reaction reminds me that it’s insane that my name is Beanie,” she says down the phone from Los Angeles. She’s from a tight-knit, semi-showbizzy family: her father’s a music-business accountant, her mother is a costume designer and her brother is the actor Jonah Hill. Eldest brother, Jordan, a music manager, died suddenly from a heart attack six months ago, aged 40. I’m told this is the only subject that’s off limits during our interview.If Feldstein’s grief is still raw, you wouldn’t know it because she’s effervescent company. She’s into nail art (“It’s the thing I spend the most money on”), Harry Potter (“At my core, I’m Mrs Weasley but that’s partly because I’m a huge Julie Walters fan”), Gilmore Girls and Queer Eye. Were you already a fan of her work?I wasn’t very familiar before going up for the role. I’ve since devoured every single piece of writing and every YouTube video. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. Now you’re heading to Wolverhampton to learn the accent …I am! I’m going for two weeks before we start shooting to just immerse myself in it. I’ve been to London twice but never the Midlands. I came with my mom on a sightseeing trip when I was younger, then again for a few days when I auditioned. I can’t wait to spend more time in the UK.So let’s talk Lady Bird. Has it been a nine-month whirlwind of award shows and acclaim?It’s been so special – not only because so many people have seen the film but how they hold it close. You get the sense it’s truly beloved. The movie was a turning point for me, too. I’ll remember my life as pre-Lady Bird and post-Lady Bird.Julie’s become something of a cult character. What’s her appeal?I think people relate to the fact that she’s unwavering in her love for Lady Bird – but equally unwavering in her self-worth. Julie doesn’t feel the need to change herself because Lady Bird’s pulling away from her she stays true to who she is.In some respects, is the film a love story between Lady Bird and\u0026nbspJulie?Absolutely. Greta always says that’s the big romance of the film. In most coming-of-age movies, it’s a guy arriving at the girl’s house to take her to the prom. In our film, that scene is between two girls. A teenage girl shows up for her friend, saying, “I was wrong, please have me back and let me be your date.” As the major romantic gesture of the story, that’s so meaningful.Is it true you kept notes on your phone called “Things Greta said today”?Well, I wanted to remember the experience as best I could – but it was an old-school notebook. We didn’t have phones on set, which was incredible – and certainly something I’ll copy if I ever direct. It forced everybody to look up, talk to each other, not get distracted. That was so vital for me and Saoirse forming our relationship because we just sat, talked, quoted Kristen Wiig sketches and goofed around between scenes.You’ve called Laurie Metcalf, who played Lady Bird’s mother, “the most inspiring woman in existence”. Why?I grew up only ever wanting to do theatre, that was my first love, and Laurie is an institution in the theatre world. She’s devoted to stage work but she navigates between that, film and TV. That’s a path I’d love to follow.Metcalf is best known in the UK as Roseanne’s sister Jackie. What did you think of the sitcom’s revival being cancelled after Roseanne Barr’s racist “joke”?That tweet was horrible. She did not deserve to be the lead of the show after that because it was the most disgusting thing.Lady Bird and How to Build a Girl are both female-led films – as is your next release, Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut Booksmart. Is that a conscious choice in the #MeToo era?There’s such a push now for everyone to be represented, regardless of gender, sexuality or race. It’s immensely important to tell their stories. I’m a huge feminist, I majored in sociology at college and I care about what I put into the world. I feel very lucky in my short working life to have been part of projects I’m proud of. Greta has set the bar high and now everything has to live up to Lady Bird. That movie opened my eyes to what film can do and how powerful it can be for people.Lady Bird is set at a Catholic high school in Sacramento. How did it compare with your own school days?I was very much in the theatre crowd, so the fact that I was doing a high-school movie where my character was in a Sondheim musical was like living my dream. Personality-wise, I lie somewhere between Lady Bird and Julie. I have Julie’s affectionate nature and intense loyalty but Lady Bird’s fire as well.Wasn’t your own prom date Ben Platt, star of the Pitch Perfect films and Broadway?It was. Ben is my soulmate, the twin I don’t have. We met at a bar mitzvah, we’ve been best friends for over a decade, and even now, we still sometimes say the exact same thing at the exact same time, then just start laughing. Maybe we were separated at birth.Jonah Hill is your older brother. Are you competitive?The only thing we compete about is impersonating our mom. We’re always arguing over whose impression is best. Other than that, we’re so supportive of one another. There’s also a pretty big age gap, nearly 10 years between us, so we were always at different stages of life.Might you work together one day?I’d love to. Jonah’s becoming such an incredible writer and director, so I could be in something he created, or we could act together. We’d both be up for that if it was the right project.Vogue called you “the next Bette Midler” after you appeared alongside her on Broadway. How was that?An honour. Bette’s the hardest working person I’ve ever encountered. She never takes breaks, never sits down, she’s a force of nature. To be around that and soak it up was a precious gift.Aren’t you an Abba fan?Big Abba fan. Huuuuge. I wake up every morning to Take a Chance on Me as my iPhone alarm – it really gets you going. I’m excited about them reforming and excited for Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. This is a very thrilling Abba year for me.Lady Bird is available to stream now and on DVDBlu-ray from tomorrow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f3e1f0983326cf457803c974c8e184efc1c6ad/0_4_2111_1267/master/2111.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b498605008ce5b735a537b94b4d6e1f0","title":"croatia denmark world cup last 16 match report","story":" There are some matches in which the spectre of penalties begins to loom with indecent haste. Everybody knew where this last-16 showdown was heading from an early point in the second half – possibly even sooner – and yet it might have needed only a single penalty.The second period of extra time was rumbling to its seemingly inevitable conclusion when Luka Modric finally picked a pass and, all of sudden, Ante Rebic was clean through. He rounded Kasper Schmeichel and was brought down by the chasing Mathias Jørgensen. Penalty. Modric took it but his composure deserted him. The kick was too close to Kasper Schmeichel and he pulled off the save. And so the match proceeded to the full version, the fate of these nations coming down to the time-honoured test of nerve.Croatia passed it, just about, after a hit-and-miss shoot-out – which neatly reflected what had gone before. After two misses apiece, the Denmark substitute, Nicolai Jørgensen strode forward and saw his kick saved by Danijel Subasic. Ivan Rakitic had one to win it and he made no mistake. It is Croatia who advance to a quarter-final against Russia in Sochi on Saturday. Modric would score in the shoot-out. His blushes were saved.The weird thing was that the game had exploded into life at the outset, with the goals coming with the first two moves. Only once previously at a World Cup had both teams scored inside four minutes – the group tie between Argentina and Nigeria in 2014.What followed was the slow death of a spectacle. The goals were undercut by comedy defending but there would be little to smile about for the remaining 116 minutes.Croatia had entered as arguably the team of the group phase. Everything had gone serenely for them and the thought did occur as to how they might react to a setback. The question was duly posed inside the opening minute.Denmark swapped their left-backs, with Jonas Knudsen coming in for Jens Stryger Larsen, and the new man brought the weapon of his long throw. From the first one, launched from the right touchline, a gaggle of defenders jumped but nobody connected and the ball broke for Thomas Delaney.The midfielder’s control was instant and he made a nice move and pass for Mathias Jørgensen, who saw the shooting chance open up. He went for it, jabbing the effort low, and what followed seemed to happen in slow motion.Domagoj Vida threw himself into a block but he did not make contact and the goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic, was slow to get down. He got a hand to the ball but he could not prevent it from trickling inside the near post. It was a horribly soft concession and Subasic will not enjoy watching the replays.Croatia’s response was immediate and this time it was the Danes who could curse their defending. Ante Rebic was afforded too much space on the right and his short pass inside released Sime Vrsaljko, who banged over the cross. It did not look threatening but Henrik Dalsgaard’s clearance was panicked, it hit the covering Andreas Christensen in the face and ricocheted to Mario Mandzukic, who swivelled and shot inside the near post. What a mess. What a start.The remainder of the game felt like a reaction to the initial chaos. Neither team had previously conceded in open play at the tournament they were not exactly disposed to such openness, and they sought to reimpose order. Caution held sway and it became an awfully tough watch.Croatia tried to get on to the front foot in the first half, with Modric and Ivan Rakitic playing as No 8s. They had openings but on each occasion, the final action was missing. Rakitic and Rebic forced Kasper Schmeichel into a double save before Ivan Perisic fired the rebound high Dejan Lovren glanced wide from a Modric free-kick – a good chance – and Rakitic ran on to a cutback only to shoot tamely.Åge Hareide had tweaked his lineup but the creative burden still rested with Christian Eriksen. Almost everything in open play went through him. He flickered in the first half, seeing one effort blocked and playing in Martin Braithwaite, who shot straight at Subasic from a tight angle. There was also the moment when Eriksen floated a cross towards the back post and watched it drift against the angle of the upright. Subasic was relieved.There were times when Eriksen pushed so high that he looked like a second striker. His stamina is the stuff of legend and the idea was that he could lead the press with the striker, Andreas Cornelius, who would be replaced by Nicolai Jørgensen.It was tight and subdued the emphasis on tactics rather than instinct and free rein. The locals in the crowd amused themselves with chants of Ros-Si-Ya. They were still giddy from their team’s penalty shootout win over Spain in the earlier kick-off and they were checking out what their quarter-final opponents had to offer. On this evidence, it was not a lot.The entertainment value was low the second half and extra-time featured little more than hopeful shooting from distance and the Modric penalty. It would need the full shoot-out to separate them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce0a9e98a994f5f75e2cb3ed537dc6548cb7af14/0_192_3496_2097/master/3496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82d424694a4132e68b049e46831ac484","title":"gareth southgate england jordan pickford full backing","story":"• Pickford mocked for ‘throwing his legs in the air’ against Belgium• Southgate: ‘I’m really pleased with his performances’Gareth Southgate has defended Jordan Pickford and publicly reaffirmed his faith in his first-choice goalkeeper after the England No 1 came in for criticism over Belgium’s winning goal in last week’s final group game.Pickford, who will start against Colombia in their last 16 match on Tuesday, endured a few nervous moments in Kaliningrad and was beaten by Adnan Januzaj’s curled attempt from just inside the penalty area, the winger benefiting from time and space to place his shot. The opposing goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, suggested the 24-year-old, at 6ft 1in, might not be tall enough. “The goalkeeper is 10cm smaller than me,” he told Belgian media. “I would have caught it. He was too busy throwing his legs in the air.”Southgate, asked whether Pickford retains his confidence, said: “Absolutely. Yes. No question. I’m really pleased with his performances. He knows the belief I have in him. He is an important fit for the way we want to play and I don’t think he’s had much chance with the goals that have gone in. That can be a goalkeeper’s lot at times. But he has to make sure he knows the views of those who are important and, like everyone else, cut himself away from the outside views that can start to inhibit your thinking.“I remember when we were talking about young goalkeepers at a conference once, Martin Thomas – who is a brilliant coach educator now and was the England under-21s’ goalkeeping coach – was talking about the difference between a couple of goalkeepers and, size-wise, he was saying: ‘At the end of the day, we’re talking about a Cadbury’s Creme Egg between them.’ That’s what it is. So, yes, of course some keepers are 6ft 6in, but they have attributes that they’re not so good at. And you get slightly smaller ones who are athletically better and have different skill sets. So, it’s rare to find perfection in anybody.”Southgate is expected to revert to the lineup which defeated Tunisia in their opening Group G fixture, with Dele Alli passed fit after a thigh strain, as England attempt to win only a third World Cup knockout game since the run to the 1990 semi-finals. “The important thing this week is we’re calm and prepare in the way we have right the way through,” the manager told TalkSport. “We’ve played well. We’ve had good processes that have got us to this point. This game is only a big game because it’s the next one, and we want to be involved in bigger ones.“So it’s important that they understand how much belief I have in them and they continue to play in the way we’re trying to play. We’ve got to be brave. We’ve got to be on the front foot. We’re playing in a style which I think the public are enjoying, and we’ve got to keep doing that. And if that goes wrong, then that’s my fault. But I want the players to be coming off the field feeling as if they’ve shown exactly how good they can be.“We’ve got to have belief in the way we’ve been playing. The challenges do step up from now on in. But, over the last year or so, we’ve played France and Spain, Germany and Brazil, and played those teams for a reason. To prepare for this moment. It’s not a step up to a level we’ve not experienced before. We haven’t suddenly become ‘not the youngest team’ in the tournament overnight or ‘not the least experienced’. We are still progressing. But we are here in the knockout phase. Most of the big teams are now here still – not all of them – so we’re going to be involved in the games we want to be involved in. It’s hugely exciting for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d886782a9fc76e9517308602d518c490d3a7ed41/0_27_7168_4302/master/7168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f6bec051d043a87568b202a54931a50","title":"watch the world cup last 10 minutes christian sinibaldi","story":"Photographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonPhotographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonWhen Christian Sinibaldi turned up at homes across England to photograph fans watching the World Cup, he was overwhelmed by every nationality’s hospitality. “And their food,” he says. “I’ve eaten a lot of crisps and beer, but also the traditional Brazilian dish of feijoada in north London, Mexican quesadillas and guacamole in Putney, and a lovely Moroccan tagine cooked on the barbecue in Letchworth.”Sinibaldi sat with a fixed camera near the television screen and never asked anyone to pose: he didn’t need to. “Pretty much as soon as the match got under way, they forgot I was there.” He enjoyed watching the tension build. “Very few people left the room or changed positions throughout the game. They were glued to their chairs.”It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. “But I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming – I could see it in their faces.” There’s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it’s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn’t make the cut.Rick Cooper, 41, and wife Jo, 41, sons Leo, eight, and Aaron, four, Malc, 44, Alison, 72Milnrow, RochdaleTiming is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper’s house, where the family are on countdown for England’s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of “Half an hour to kick-off” drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George’s flags.The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers – grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five – know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England.Stones’ header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. “I missed it!” says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five – including two Harry Kane penalties – all before half-time. “This is unbelievable!” Rick shouts. “Football’s coming home.” The noise from the boys’ vuvuzelas is deafening. “The boys were too little for Brazil 2014,” says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, “so I’m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I’m mad for it now.”His brother Malc says, “You always have that hope with England, and it’s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona’s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we’re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there’s a different mentality.”Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, “The country couldn’t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: ‘If they play football, they’ll murder ’em.’ He’d have been thrilled with this one.”Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 JuneCristina “Kiki” Machado’s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki’s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. “We drew six,” says Kiki (in hat), “because Brazil has won five times – we drew one more for luck.”Kiki’s living room is packed out with her “north London family”, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend’s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children.“My family in Brazil said people aren’t celebrating there the way we are,” Kiki says. “It’s natural when you’re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.” She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, “Of course. Your teacher will understand.”After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. “I’m in defence mode,” says Janaína Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). “That game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.”The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don’t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that’s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. “When we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,” Kiki says. “The hangover lasted a week.”Adama Karde and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 JuneThe music and the chat don’t stop at Adama Karde’s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums.Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. “Senegal is like Brazil,” he says. “Everyone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too – I’m a good player.”An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Mané sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: “It’s game on. Game on.” But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates.“I wanted more,” Adama admits at full time. “They got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.”For him, the World Cup couldn’t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour’s TV. “When Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.”Neilum agrees: “They love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they’re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric – it’s just fire.”Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He’s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, “because when there’s a football match on, we want to watch it”.Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed’s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right).The 1-0 loss to Iran is “a bit of a let-down”, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: “Footballers in England are so famous – it’s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.”“I would love Morocco to win,” Mohammed says, “but realistically, it’s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We’ve been asking for about 20 years.” His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: “I was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.”Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly.Today the Nishis – Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) – are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he’s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa’s penalty, secured in the game’s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos Sánchez: “It was kind of scary before he took it – we were very surprised that we won.”His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. “To be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn’t get a good result.” Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages.For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. “Japan didn’t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.”The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a “very strong” Belgium.Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 JuneIf only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: “Vahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team’s hope).” Sadly, his golden foot doesn’t save the day: Iran’s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0.It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. “We often get together for food and gossip and chat,” says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, “so you can eat with your eyes first”.Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. “That is what we do when ladies get together,” she says. “The group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.”“I think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,” says Shirin, “but not attack. Even if they try to score, there’s nobody there they keep themselves to their own goal.” Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, “because they don’t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.”Pupak agrees: “It was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times – even though they lost, I think they did quite well.”Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. “My youngest said, ‘But Mummy, I’m English.’ Even though I’ve spent most of my life here, I don’t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.”On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: “We sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,” says Deanna, 47 (on left). “We try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.” Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion.Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. “Often you question where home really is,” Deanna says, “but the World Cup erases that feeling. I’m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,” she says of the winning goal, “it was such an amazing feeling. I don’t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.”The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven’t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. “Back then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.” His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: “Even if we were 3-0 up, I’d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.” Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 JuneIceland’s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland’s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, “It’s like a fairytale – we’re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we’re so super proud of them.”But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. “When we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,” Silla says, “but Gylfi Sigurdsson didn’t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.”What went wrong? “They were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn’t keep up with that pace.”Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team’s strength. “The Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.”Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Thór Halldórsson, whom he describes as “a Viking shield wall”. “I was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete – then that became the more important part of his career.” Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters’ “Viking clap” as a lead-in.But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. “People approach us and say, ‘Well done.’ Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.”Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 JuneIn Colombia, football isn’t watched with strangers in a bar – it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa).The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone’s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations.Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009.“Growing up in Colombia,” he says, “sport isn’t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it’s a little bit of home in the UK.”The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode – and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. “Goooooooooooal-azo,” they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: “Championes, championes, olé, olé, olé!”Erik says, “Football is an international language. I play four or five times a week – it’s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club’s kit and now we are all watching together.”“The last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals James Rodríguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.”Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 JuneStudies over the years have reported that the French aren’t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren’t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France’s victory over Peru. “It was a bit weak,” Yves says, “they could have done a lot better than that. I didn’t find it very exciting really.” Jeremy agrees, pointing out, “We have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn’t win.”Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. “We want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it’s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.”Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. “I remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there’s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, ‘I belong to that country.’ Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I’ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven’t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.”There’s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. “To bring luck,” Jeremy says, “we all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.”At the apex of a isive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win.“It was a brilliant game,” Yves says. “Mexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly it wasn’t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half unfortunately we didn’t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.”The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. José Pablo, 19, “will probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays”. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: “And of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas – as an expat, it’s a way to connect with your country.”After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. “I was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It’s very, very powerful.”Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. “I love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That’s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.”Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. “It was a bittersweet feeling,” Yves says. “I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico ‘the fifth game’,” ie the quarter-finals. “That has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,” he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. “We didn’t care about our score,” he says. “We were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.”Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 JuneNo one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung’s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. “I asked my friends how they thought we would do,” says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, “and they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.” He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. “I saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.”Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks – an extremely popular combination the Koreans call “chi-maek”, from “chi” for chicken and “maekju”, the Korean word for beer. “Unfortunately we couldn’t find Korean beer,” Jaeyoung says, “so we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.” They hung up the Korean flag for luck.“I don’t watch football usually, just the World Cup,” says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. “It’s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I’ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I’m really happy to support them.” For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. “It was the best moment – a miracle.”Despite today’s loss, they are extremely proud of the team’s forward, Son Heung-min. “He got a really incredible goal during extra time,” says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. “After the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, ‘Don’t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!’”He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team’s World Cup. “I didn’t expect that kind of score,” he says. “It was really impressive.” The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored: “And I was like, ‘What the hell? This is awesome,’” Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn’t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. “We were screaming and dancing,” Jaeyoung says . “I just wish I had put a bet on.”Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 JuneThe balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova’s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. “He was absent on principle,” she explains. “He’s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn’t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.”Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love Anastasiia’s husband is British, and Polina’s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg.Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt’s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: “I don’t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.”“Our first goal was the best moment for me,” Anastasiia says. “I remember thinking, we’re so close to winning the game, and if we win we’ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.” She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: “I hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren’t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.”Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. “We won and that was a surprise for everyone,” she says. “We’ve only won two games so far – but for us it’s like we’ve won the whole thing.”• Commenting on this piece?

Missing out, because of the crazy choices of Giampiero Ventura, the man who led Italy during the doomed qualifying campaign, hurts us all, the players included. Even now they talk about it. Even now it shocks and upsets them.The World Cup is still a huge ratings success in Italy: the main stations talk about it 24 hours a day and go over every detail. The radio stations also cover the tournament continuously while the first pages of the newspapers feature the World Cup prominently. From the intriguing back stories to the great protagonists like Lionel Messi and Cristiam Ronaldo the World Cup is the main topic of discussion in Italy.Italian people love football and that will never change. We will never turn away from watching World Cup maches and even the less glamorous games at this tournament have set viewing records: there has never been a World Cup followed in Italy quite like this one.Everyone is engrossed and the majority of football die-hards are supporting Argentina: the ties of lineage between Italy and South America remain strong. A sympathy of history. The rivalries with Germany and France are also rousing interest, while Croatia are popular among some here given many of their players are emplyed by Italian clubs.A World Cup stops time: every four years you remember where you were when the matches were on, who you were with and what you were doing when your national team scored. I saw Italy win the World Cup in Germany and every match was an unforgettable moment. Losing the professional as well as human experience of seeing Italy at a World Cup hurts but, nevertheless, it remains a beautiful thing. Fabrizio RomanoFor a second major tournament in a row we are not there, a second major tournament without orange-coloured squares, pubs, kindergartens, offices and viaducts. Are we used to it now? No. It still hurts and aches, especially when we see red fan zones in Flandres and Englishmen standing on tables in Newcastle, and while our pain has been somewhat eased by Germany’s early exist it was only a small consolation for the Dutch, especially as Germany isn’t as unpopular here as they were in 1988 when we finally beat them at their own place to win the European Championship.We are not turning our head away from the World Cup, however. The matches in Russia are the best viewed television programmes in the country right now, though ratings have dropped compared to two years ago, during Euro 2016, and are nothing compared to Holland games at big tournaments. Newspapers and websites remain filled with World Cup coverage thought not many sports journalists from Holland are actually to Russia and noticeable are the large number of programmes, online and TV, about Dutch Moroccans because of the five players in Morocco’s squad that were born and raised in Holland.This is the first major tournament I have missed since Euro 2004 and it’s a strange experience not being in the stadiums and the training camps, smelling the atmosphere and seeing all the great colours that are worn with pride. But, like my compatriots, I’m still watching the World Cup I love the games even though I do miss the party. Bart VlietstraWhen Chile were at the World Cups in South Africa and Brazil most of the national TV networks, radio stations and newspapers sent journalists to cover them – for this tournament, only two or three guys have been sent out while most networks are using correspondents based in Europe.Everybody has a TV and everyone is watching the games but the passion is not the same without Chile. Saying that, there is passion against two ‘enemies’: Saudi Arabia and Argentina. Juan Antonio Pizzi, the Saudi manager, was the coach of Chile during the qualification campaign and many people here solely blame him for the country’s failure to reach Russia. Argentina, on the other hand, has been a rival since the two Copa America Cup finals and they have songs about Chile not going to the World Cup, so Chileans really want them out of the tournament. My work consists of watching games and try to find a connection between them and Chile. So for instance, after México beat Germany 1-0, we remembered the 7-0 win Chile had against them in Centenario America Cup two years ago and how they went from that humiliation to this historic feat to beating the world champions. It hurts to be watching a World Cup without Chile, especially considering this would have been a last chance for Gary Medel, Arturo Vidal and other members of the Golden Generation to perform on the biggest stage. The hurt is felt more in light of Germany’s elimination and the other big teams struggling – this could have been our World cup. Next time, maybe. Samuel FerreiroYears before Ghana made it to the World Cup for a first time, in 2006, the tournament dominated media coverage in the country. Ghana loves football and we make a big deal about the World Cup whether we’re there or not. It’s been the same this time around.The Multimedia Group, Ghana’s biggest media conglomerate, acquired radio broadcast rights for the tournament - the first time it’s been done on such a scale in the country. Commentary for all 64 games is offered to listeners in English and Akan, the most widely spoken dialect here. Full online and social media coverage has become standard for many press houses, and TV coverage is at its busiest.Ghanaian football fans have always had differing opinions, but the African agenda remains common when the World Cup is on. Support for the five teams from the continent in Russia has been high (making it a shame none of them have managed to qualify for the last 16) while it is not uncommon for many people to support a second teams, notably Brazil, Germany or Argentina. There is also a smattering of support for England here.On a personal and professional level, the tournament has been busy time. I am on live commentary duty almost every other day and my heavy presence on social media means I do not take a break, either.

Our team, of course, who have some of the best players in the world, are used to playing under pressure and that is certainly true for Neymar.You could see that from the contrasting emotions after the final whistle in the second and the third games. Against Costa Rica he broke down in tears at the end, despite Brazil winning 2-0. Against Serbia, however, after Tite’s team had secured first place in the group, he was laughing and waving to the crowd.Against Costa Rica he had just scored a late goal and it was just an enormous relief of pressure. It was as if a huge weight had been taken off his shoulders. On the other hand, against Serbia, the win was more serene and there was not the same tension.Either way, I think that it is very important for this Brazil team, as they prepare to take on Mexico, to listen only to themselves and not care about what others say. Just focus on the games.That is how I always try to do it. However, sometimes it is impossible not to get emotional with a win or a defeat, especially if there is a lot at stake.For example, the game against Australia in the 2016 Rio Olympics was an extreme occasion. It was a very tough game, very challenging for us. It went to penalties and when it was my turn … it was saved by their goalkeeper.The shootout continued and in the end we won after our goalkeeper made a save – and after that I couldn’t hold the tears back. I started crying because of all the emotions that had been involved in that game. We dedicate our entire lives to play important matches and important tournaments.Sometimes tears of sadness come out and sometimes tears of happiness. It could be tears of sadness because a team was utterly dominant yet still did not win or the tears of happiness could be after a last-minute goal. Football is an emotional game and that is why I like it. We care.Talking about high-pressure situations leads me on to the captaincy. To be captain of your country is an amazing feeling, one of the best in the world – but it also comes with a lot of pressure. If you are captain you have responsibilities.At the moment I am the captain for our national team but I also make sure that my teammates feel very included. I think it is important that they have a powerful voice as well and that they are part of leading the team, taking it forward.I believe that when you put the weight of leadership on just one or two players that can have a negative effect on the team, with that one person being overloaded, and there is also an increased risk of factions within the squad.I became national-team captain in 2012 and led our team for a couple of games in that year’s Olympics. Ever since I was little I have been put in positions of leadership. And the pressure of that is something that is normal to me.I always talk to my teammates and ask them to say something. There is no need for me to always be the last one to say something before a game. I leave things open, so my teammates can express themselves. That way we can show that everyone is important in the team.I like the fact Tite has rotated the captaincy – and that is something I have mentioned to our national-team coach. I think it is positive that everyone feels they are important to the team and sharing the captaincy around is a great way of showing that.Pressure means different things to different people and we will see that when Brazil take on Mexico. When I go on the pitch I try to be happy and to concentrate on the things that matter to me. I look for inspiration in my own story. I go back and see how hard I have worked to be where I am, how difficult it was and everything I overcame. So, for me, the day of the game is the easiest part, it is the time for you to enjoy the moment, be happy and always look to do your best.If you are playing in a World Cup final or Olympic final with all that pressure, it is because you deserve to be there. Not all players have that privilege, so it is important that we enjoy the moment, the situation and try to be happy in all moments, always.As for the next game of the 2018 World Cup, I am happy that Brazil got Mexico. It should be a great game. Mexico are a team that go out and play. They are a fast team with counterattacks as their biggest weapon with quick players such as Chicharito. However, they also have extremely hard-working players who fight until the bitter end and never give up.In a way, I think that can suit Brazil. Mexico’s style of play could open up space for Tite’s team to exploit. It seems that every team try their hardest against Brazil because of our history and our five World Cup titles, but I still think that Brazil will win this one and go through to the quarter-finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c0b0318cf4b5477f2f3000017dae3f3969b6e5b/19_0_4909_2947/master/4909.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1271326bb2b68b62937898ff10328e95","title":"croatia v denmark world cup 2018 live","story":"I have to head up to record the World Cup Football Daily podcast now (give it a listen later) so I will leave you to absorb the reaction to Croatia’s victory in your own time. Perhaps, if they can again reach the heights they did against Argentina, we will be happy that they went through tonight (Danes excluded obviously). I would quite like to see more passes like the one Luka Modric slid through for Kramaric before the extra-time penalty. Just delightful. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Bye. Here’s our first-take match report: Our man in Nizhny Novgorod David Hytner’s report will be pasted over the top very shortly. On the subject of Jorgensen’s foul, George Garrett, and a few others, write: “Ed Rostron saying this is bad refereeing... I agree, it should be more than a yellow, but the referee was only following the new set of rules. By all means be angry at the rulebook, but please give the referees a break. Especially this one, he’s had a good game.” Anyway, how did you rate the performances of the two teams, Let us know here. It wasn’t a classic – and Croatia weren’t at their best – but this last 16 tie delivered drama again. Schmeichel made one penalty save in extra-time and two in the shootout. But Subaric was just as good in goal for Croatia in the shootout and Croatia perhaps had big-game players who were capable of handling the pressure better than Denmark’s. Russia will fancy their chances against Croatia if they turn up and play as they did tonight. On the balance of play Denmark perhaps just deserved to go through but Croatia, on their day, are much more talented and Modric’s pass to Kramaric perhaps deserved to win the game.Penalties! Croatia 3-2 Denmark (Rakitic scores!) The Barcelona midfielder drills it into the bottom left corner with his right foot, sending Schmeichel the wrong way. And breathe.Subasic does it again! Jorgensen went down the middle and Subasic left his legs there. Rakitic has the chance to win it. Schmeichel saves again! Down to his left and a wonderful stop. Pivaric bent it towards the corner with pace but the keeper was equal to it. Subasic saves to his right. He got there with time to spare after guessing right. Modric goes straight down the middle and does beat Schmeichel this time. Just! Schmeichel’s leg almost stopped it. Hard and low to Subasic’s right. A great strike. Cool as you like. Nonchalantly slotted to Schmeichel’s right after a stutter. Straight at Schmeichel, who saves with his legs!Subasic knocks it onto the post. A great save down to his right. So, here we go. Penalties once again! Looks like Denmark will go first.Both teams are in a huddle. Apparently, the official reasoning for Jorgensen only receiving a yellow instead of a red is that the referee deemed it to be a genuine attempt to play the ball. “My 1-1 and going to extra time prediction from minute 14 was correct! Where do I send my address to get my free beer? Wait... there is a free beer, right?” Jeffrey Lilly pats himself on the back. An email: “So the ref decides that bringing down a guy as he’s about to tap into an empty net is not a red card. And Modric missed the penalty, Jørgensen gets away with it. That is why you should have penalty goals in football. That’s simply unacceptable refereeing,” roars Ed Rostron. ET 120 min: Modric has a go from distance but it’s straight at Schmeichel. ET 118 min: Well, at last some drama. Denmark didn’t deserve to lose before having a go at penalties given their improved performance. But Modric’s moment of brilliance and the way that Kramaric was brought down just before he was about to slide the ball home will have many Croatia fans believing they should be going through without the trauma of a shootout.ET 116 min: Modric slides the ball to Schmeichel’s left and Schmeichel is there to save with his midriff. He gave Modric the eyes and went one way and then ed the other. The ball was in the corner but Schmeichel read him and gathered it. He’s mobbed. And high in the stands his dad punches the air like a giddy child.ET 115 min: Modric splits Denmark’s defence with a wonderful pass. Kramaric hares on to it and rounds Schmeichel but is brought down by Jorgensen just as he is about to slide it home. Amazingly, Jorgensen is only booked. Modric to take it. ET 113 min: Knudsen winds his shoulders back and sends one airborne. It’s flicked on to Jorgensen at the far post, but he twists his body and drags his right-footed effort wide. It wasn’t an easy chance but he could have done better. ET 112 min: Jorgensen dinks the ball inside him looking for Eriksen. Lovren steams in and slices the ball out for a Knudsen special. ET 110 min: Denmark are popping the passes around midfield with vim and vigour. They finally give the ball away and Croatia win a free-kick after Nicolai Jorgensen shoves Kramaric to the floor. Still, Denmark look the more liklely to nick this before penalties.ET 109 min: Mandzukic, who looks completely out of gas, is replaced by Badelj. ET 107 min: Did I mention Sisto replaced Braithwaite? Well he did and he has just been sent haring down the inside left channel by Eriksen, turning sharply before curling just wide of the far post with a dipping right-footer. ET 106 min: Sisto releases Jorgensen on the inside-right channel. He gallops into the box but slams his cross into Pivaric. ET 105 min: “I imagine that when an entire team seems to no longer function as they can it must be a problem with shape or formation (or passing sideways slowly). Would that be a fair excuse for Croatia?” asks Ian Copestake. Yes, but Denmark’s change of shape from three at the back to a back four has helped level the midfield battle.Peep! Modric was more lively at the end of that half. But this looks like we’re heading for penalties. ET 105 min: Modric wallops the corner at the near post, where Denmark clear. It’s not happening.Et 104 min: That’s more like it. Modric lifts a beautiful pass over Denmark’s defence for Kramaric, who takes a feather-toed touch before winning a corner. The first is cleared and then Croatia win another. Modric to take it …ET 103 min: Croatia finally have a bit of possession. There absolutely no movement in front of Modric and co though. 101 min: Croatia hoik a long ball over the top for Mandzukic but he’s offside. ET 100 min: “Is extra-time just a waste of time?” asks David Penney. “In most cases both sides are so shattered it’s played at most at a jogging pace, both teams reluctant to over stretch their defences. I may be completely proven wrong in the next 30mins. Shouldn’t it just go straight to penalties and be done with it?” Denmark are making a go of it here David. But yes, it’s hardly electric stuff.ET 98 min: Schone, who has been very good since replacing Christensen, takes a lovely touch with his instep before arcing a shot towards the far post from 25 yards that drifts a foot wide. Denmark are getting closer. Do you remember when Croatia were good?Et 97 min: Delaney is replaced by Krohn-Dehli. After a difficult first half Delaney has been excellent. Et 94 min: Eriksen is sent scuttling down the inside right channel. He clips the ball in towards Nicolai Jorgensen but it bounces and skips away to Knudsen on the far post. he skips into the box and is almost brought down ion theby Perisic but wriggles free and stays on his feet before hammering a decent ball into the box that is cleared for a corner. The corner is cleared for a throw that Knudsen flings into the box, again causing panic. Denamrk are well on top. Croatia look spent. This is the Knudsen show!ET 92 min: The first throw is cleared to the edge of the box where Schone takes a shy at goal only for his shot to cannon off a defender and out for another thrown. Knudsen shuffles over to the other side of the pitch and hurls another on in. Croatia head clear.ET 90 min: Knudsen curls a dipping ball into the box from the left that Braithwaite heads down towards Nicolai Jorgensen. It causes all kinds of jitters in the Croatia box and is eventually cleared. A throw-in on the right. Knudsen prepares his latest missile.“As I try to take a positive out of a negative the current long wait for penalties is enlivened by the thought of how Ramos must be feeling,” chuckles Ian Copestake. Ruth Purdue brings the love for referee Nestor Pitana. “He is always on it, rarely makes a mistake and doesn’t take any nonsense. Also helps players up. Refreshing. Hope he get’s further in the tournament.” He’s already got as far as any other Argentinian Ruth. An email: “This match lacks Suker and spice,” honks Peter Oh. Can’t disagree Peter. The first four minutes feel like they took place at Brazil 2014. Yes, it’s Croatia 1-1 Denmark after 90 mins. We’ll have another 30 minutes of this. I hope it gets better.90+3 min: Denmark race up the other end and win a corner. Eriksen whips it in from the right. Subasic gets a soft fist to it and Poulsen mishits a volley a foot wide.90+1 min: Rakitic thumps a low shot at goal from 30 yards. It’s hit with some venom but ends up a foot wide of Schmeichel’s left-hand post. 90 min: It’s another looping torpedo but this one is hoofed well clear and Croatia start to build after gathering the ball in midfield. Also, there will be three more minutes of this before another 30 minutes of this. Argh!89 min: Knudsen hurls another long throw into the box. It’s huge and flicks off Lovren’s head and runs out for another throw on the opposite side. Schone to do his Rory Delap impression again …88 min: Schone fires well over from 20 yards. Denmark still fancy this.86 min: Croatia have found their missing spark. Rebic twists Knudsen all over the place like a child’s rubber toy and then drills a cross into the box that causes all kinds of mayhem. Modric fires the ball into a defender and out for corner. This is more lively at last. The corner is decent outswinger too but the Danes defend it well. 84 min: Kovacic is dusted off and back on his feet. The free-kick is played short and worked out to Pivaric. He whips the ball in to the near-post, where Perisic flicks a looping header backwards and just over the bar. 82 min: Kovacic is dumped in a heap by a collection of Denmark players. He’s holding his shoulder and wearing a grim expression. He could be in trouble here.80 min: Another Croatia change: Pivaric, a left-back, is coming on for Strinic, who has looked lost this half. Apparently Pivaric is a full-back of the bombing-on variety with a mistake in him. The Croation Alberto Moreno, if you like. There could be some fun times to be had if he goes on an adventurous dawdle up field.79 min: “Not sure if he has already had his one for the game, but if not it might yet be enlivened by a Lovren faux pas,” writes Ian Copestake. Not yet Ian. But give him time. And boy, does this game need something to liven it up. 77 min: Modric attempts to trouble Schmeichel with a 30-yarder after a poor clearance but his shot his pulled well wide. And then Vrsaljko drills one straight at Schmeichel after a little shuffle through midfield. That’s more like it. From small acorns etc and so on …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde6452f7751e49e68c2630c7847219b7d6c9f3d/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f66a3385e3a13bcd6eddeeed4aee3f","title":"for the love of playmobil our home toy stories","story":"Colour and kitsch collide in this Brazilian couple’s flat, transforming it into a corner of Rio in LondonAsk graphic designer Eduardo Lima and costume designer Mauricio Carneiro to tell you why they moved to their two-bedroomed 1970s flat in north London and they’ll probably tell you about Eduardo’s goddaughter who lives nearby. Or how much they liked the green spaces of the communal gardens and nearby Parkland Walk. But that’s only half the story. Press a little harder and you’ll find out that the truth has more to do with a small plastic toy created by Hans Beck in 1974. “We have a collection of over 2,000 Playmobil figures, kept from our childhoods and added to ever since,” confesses Eduardo. “One of the best things about moving into this apartment was unpacking them all. We’ve never had the space to display them before – and they make me smile every time I walk past them. I sometimes imagine them having little parties while we’re out.”The pair met at a fashion show in Brazil 18 years ago and bumped into each other again at a bar a week later. When Eduardo told Mauricio that he was returning to London, Mauricio’s reply was simple, but momentous: “May I come with you?” They’ve been together ever since and a civil partnership in 2007 (later converted into a marriage) made it official. “He is my soulmate – my everything,” says Eduardo, who co-runs MinaLima, the graphic design agency behind all the props for the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films as well as the wider Wizarding World franchise. Luckily, a 20-minute conversation about colour – orange and green in particular – on that fateful first date and a shared love of Playmobil meant that they were on the same page when it came to decorating the flat they bought in 2004.They started by creating a white backdrop for their colourful collections. “The previous owner had painted everything mustard yellow – even the ceilings,” says Eduardo. “We almost wrote it off as too small and too yellow, so I’m glad we saw its potential – even if it did take three coats of paint.” Once they’d finished decorating, they set about unpacking the Playmobil figures, displaying them by type in a vintage, glass-fronted cabinet. “They are arranged in groups – policemen with policemen, pirates with pirates – to stop it from feeling too cluttered,” explains Eduardo. “There is an element of curation, but not too much.”As well as Playmobil, the pair also collects the letters E and M in vintage 3D characters – an assemblage which started with the light-up green E perched on the arm of the sofa that Mauricio bought for Eduardo. “Now he gets really upset that there just seem to be more Es in the world than Ms,” laughs Eduardo.Other collections include the religious iconography typical of Brazil displayed against a bright green (Eduardo’s favourite colour) wall in the hall, the Disney merchandise in the master bedroom, the tin toys that line the dining room mirror, and books – lots of books. “There’s an amazing Oxfam bookshop local to us,” says Eduardo, “and we seem to come home with another five or 10 every weekend.” The couple invested in the 606 Universal Shelving System by Vitsoe for their library when they moved into this flat. “Vitsoe is life-changing. It hasn’t moved a millimetre since we had it installed.”Collections taken care of, they turned to furniture, settling on the Bo Concept sofa that fits so perfectly into their lounge area, alongside a collection of house plants. “Brazilians do love their plants,” explains Eduardo. The flat is arranged around an open living-dining area, with a small kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom off the L-shaped corridor that connects it to the front door. The 1960s teak dining table and Formica chairs are exact replicas of the ones both Eduardo and Mauricio grew up with.“My mum hated them so much, she eventually threw hers away,’ laughs Eduardo. “They’re really expensive now. We managed to find ours about six years ago.” The wallpaper behind the table is Orla Kiely for Habitat and the Eames RAR rocking chair was a wedding gift. The mid-century aesthetic, the Brazilian-inspired cacophony of colour and pattern, and the nostalgic collections are all part of creating a home from home.“I’ve been in London for over 20 years, so I feel very comfortable here,” says Eduardo. “I miss the people and the food more than the country itself, but I think that’s because we’ve created a little corner of Brazil in our apartment. It’s the same if you visit any of our Brazilian friends. It’s like walking into an apartment in Rio.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1719d8f4f95b9cb9395a0f299cbd9e802998974f/0_2062_4927_2955/master/4927.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8e6bdac955c6f9d528deb7b0c0e773e","title":"nigel slater summer fruit drinks and salty nibbles recipes","story":"From gooseberry and elderflower to watermelon fizz, anchovy rolls to olives with chilli, we’ve got summer coveredWe need a drink. Not a glass of wine or a cold beer, but something long, sweet-sour and fizzing with the flavours of the season. So we make one or, more accurately, a jug full. A drink that is truly seasonal, of gooseberries and elderflower, and then another of watermelon and the sort of sparkling wines that seem made for when the sun is shining. And then we take them outdoors.Every drink, be it a small, cold golden beer or an espresso, needs something to go with it. A bite or two. That something could be a tiny, too-hot-to-hold pastry filled with a paste of anchovies and pine kernels or it could be an olive or two that you have marinated with roast peppers, rust-red chillies and coriander. A spicy morsel to alternate with a swig of icy watermelon fizz.The one truly essential rule for making summer drinks is that they be iced. Hand me a lukewarm cocktail on a summer’s day and I’ll probably throw it at you. Ice cubes, yes, but you could swap them for frozen berries or chunks of fruit. I made a gooseberry drink this week and cooled it with frozen berries. Rather than dissolving into your drink like ice cubes, they partially thaw as they do their work and leave you with diminutive, sozzled nuggets to scoop up at the end.A bright red drink to cool a blazing hot summer’s day. It also makes a splendid water ice. Just pop it in the freezer.Cut the watermelon into 3cm thick slices, remove the skin and seeds, then place in a freezer bag, seal and freeze for 2 hours.Put the frozen watermelon into a blender, add the elderflower cordial and process to a bright pink slush.Tip into 12 small glasses, then top up with prosecco, and if you wish, some edible flower petals.There are few drinks that don’t appreciate an olive or two. Enough for 12roasted peppers 150g, bottled or cannedred chilli 1, largesmoked paprika 1 tspcoriander leaves a small handfulgreen olives, pitted 160g (drained weight)cipollini onions 100gPurée the peppers and chilli in a blender or processor, add the smoked paprika and coriander leaves and process to a soft red and green paste. Scrape it into a bowl, add the olives and onions and fold gently together. Serve with the watermelon fizz.We made a paste of anchovies, olives, thyme and pine kernels, the scent of which reminded me of a Provençal farm I visited years ago. A farm where the owners made not only their own olive oil but also deep vats of tapenade from the crushed olives. They threw in dried thyme and ground bay. The fragrant paste below is also worth making to spread on thin, curling sheets of crispbread or to wedge into the furrows of a rib of celery.Pat the anchovies with kitchen paper to remove the excess oil. If you are using salted anchovies, rinse them briefly then dry them with paper. Put the anchovies in the bowl of a food processor together with the pitted olives, pine kernels, dried thyme, peeled garlic and parsley. Grate the zest from the lemon and add, then process to a thick paste.Roll the puff pastry out on a lightly floured board to a rectangle measuring roughly 30x40cm. Have the long side facing you, then cut the pastry into three 40cm-long strips. Break the egg into a small bowl and beat with a fork until thoroughly mixed. Brush the pastry strips with beaten egg.Place 12 tsp of the filling along one side of each of the pastry strips then lightly smooth into a long thin sausage shape. Fold the pastry over the filling then press the pastry edges firmly together to seal. Cut the sausage into 10 small pieces, place them on the baking sheet, a centimetre or two apart, then brush with more of the beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with nigella seeds. Repeat with the remaining two strips of pastry and the reserved filling.

There is no alcohol here, but gin would put a spring in its step. We used frozen gooseberries in lieu of ice cubes.Put the 18 reserved berries in the freezer. Remove the stalks and dried flowers from the gooseberries. Put the berries in a stainless-steel saucepan, add the sugar, elderflower cordial and water and bring to the boil. As soon as the berries start to burst and the sugar has dissolved remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.Ladle the berries and their liquid into the jug of a blender, add the mint leaves and process to a pale green, sweet-tart syrup.

We must have a say on where to go nextYou may say these statistics, drawn from a 90-page Mediatique report commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, tell us nothing new. Anyone with a passing interest has long been aware of the gloomy truth about the demise of newsprint. It was forecast at the end of the last century – although too few people, including most of the key figures within the trade, refused to acknowledge its implications. It meant that publishers, confronted by the erosion of the ink-on-paper platform, failed to devise a positive strategy to prevent the inevitable, existential effects on journalism.Why the delay? There were three overlapping reasons. Initially, there was a denial of reality – a belief, despite the evidence, in the durability of print, and a parallel misconception about the impact of the digital revolution. I lost count of the times I heard head-in-sand nonsense about the survival of papers. “We beat off radio, we accommodated television, and we will see off the net.” Oh yeah?Secondly, and crucially, the crisis of an accelerating decline in the popularity of newspapers revealed the disconnect between journalism as a business, and journalism as a public service. So, in response to falling profit margins, owners instituted cost-cutting on a scale that has, over time, eroded the quality and quantity of editorial output. Journalism has taken second place to profitability.Thirdly, a competitive, free-market culture ensured that owners would seek to act against each other. To that end, they have been engaged in a last-man-standing gameplan in the belief that the winner takes all. It may make business sense, but it sounds the death knell for journalism.Meanwhile, until very recently, publishers – particularly those responsible for regional and local news brands – have been guilty of a disgraceful deception. While denuding their organisations of journalists, they maintained that news coverage did not suffer. Despite copious evidence to the contrary, with judges complaining about empty press benches in courtrooms and local politicians enjoying the absence of reporters at council meetings, newspaper owners pooh-poohed critics (such as me) who warned of their failure to fulfil their public service remit.Even before social media, it was obvious that the business model underpinning newspaper publishing could not be sustained. Advertising revenue would continue to decline, and falling sales meant circulation revenue would also drop away.In such circumstances, if we wanted journalism, as distinct from newspapers, to survive, it was necessary to contemplate new forms of funding. One alternative I championed was a public subsidy, similar to the BBC licence fee. This was anathema to publishers. It was counter to their ethos, they argued, protesting disingenuously about it being a threat to freedom of the press – thereby implying that their own form of ownership, and the funding of journalism by advertising, is press freedom’s perfect formula.Belatedly, publishers admitted that their cuts had, as predicted, reduced coverage. They were forced to go into partnership with the BBC, which agreed to fund 150 “local democracy reporters”. More, inevitably, will be required.At the same time, publishers complained, campaigned and lobbied against social media, especially Facebook and Google. The result was the decision by culture secretary, Matt Hancock, to launch a review – chaired by Dame Frances Cairncross – into “what intervention might be required to safeguard the future of our free and independent press”. Hence the Mediatique report, a prelude to that review.I take heart from Cairncross’s statement that it “is not about preserving the status quo”. She said: “We need to explore ways in which we can ensure that consumers in 10 years’ time have access to high-quality journalism which meets their needs, is delivered in the way they want, and supports democratic engagement.”Good stuff, but I also note that she has recruited an 11-strong advisory panel which includes publishers who have been responsible for journalism’s deterioration, and who have a vested interest in making profits, rather than aiding democracy.While I share with those publishers a belief that Google and Facebook could do more to underwrite independent journalism, I am eager to see the emergence of funding innovations that they have so far opposed. There must be transitional support, via government if necessary, for news organisations prepared to consider a mixed economy: philanthropy informal public contributions (as the  is doing) formal public subsidies payments for partial online access and, yes, advertising too. At the same time, there needs to be an acceptance of the benefits of pooled reporting and a measure of stimulation for freelance agencies.Cairncross is prepared to accept written evidence from anyone over the next two months and hopes to produce a report early next year. There is a sense of this being a last-chance saloon. Journalists who care about our trade should not miss the chance to take their place at the bar.The murder of five staff at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, is the fusion of two macabre phenomena in Donald Trump’s America. One, which predates his regime, is regular mass shootings. The other is the Trump-inspired demonisation of the media.Doubtless, the president’s apologists will cast Jarrod Ramos’s bloody rampage in the newsroom as a one-off. It is absurd, they will argue, to view Trump’s oft-quoted complaints about journalists as giving “permission” for a man with a grudge to go on a killing spree.But we should not ignore the link between statements by the nation’s commander in chief and the actions of those able to bear arms due to Trump’s acceptance of a wilful misinterpretation of the second amendment, and his refusal to pass strict gun-ownership laws.Trump views journalists as the enemy. He takes every opportunity to denigrate them, accusing them of purveying fake news, and seeks to undermine their attempts to hold his administration to account.In so doing, he gives encouragement to people to treat reporters as an alien force.The very real danger now is of copycat attacks. It appeared momentarily excessive when a BBC TV correspondent referred in the aftermath of the tragedy to the need for an “abundance of caution” at newspaper offices. Her concern, on reflection, was absolutely right.

The consultation will examine whether there should be exemptions from the three-year rule for student accommodation, where tenancies are tied to the academic year. Brokenshire said: “It is deeply unfair when renters are forced to uproot their lives or find new schools for their children at short notice due to the terms of their rental contract. “Being able to call your rental property your home is vital to putting down roots and building stronger communities. That’s why I am determined to act, bringing in longer tenancies which will bring benefits to tenants and landlords alike.”Under the proposed longer-term agreement, tenants would be able to leave before the end of the minimum term, but would have greater protection if they wanted to stay in a property for an extended period of time.But the National Landlords Association (NLA) said only four out of 10 tenants actually want longer contracts, describing the proposal as a vote-grabbing ”political move”.Richard Lambert, chief executive of the NLA, said: “This is a policy which the Conservatives derided when it was put forward by their opponents in the past two general election campaigns. It’s hard not to see this as more of a political move aimed at the renter vote than a genuine effort to improve how the rented market works for all those involved.”Behind the government’s proposals lie growing concern about the number of families that face bringing up children in short-term rental accommodation. Polly Neate, the chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: “This is an important step forward. Losing a tenancy is the main driver of homelessness and also causes huge instability for renting families, so everyone who rents will be very pleased to see a move towards longer tenancies. “But if the government really wants to stand up for renters, they should provide real protection from eviction, and the huge upheaval of having to move home, jobs and schools.”Labour said the plans do not go far enough, and that tenants need caps on rents.The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said: “Any fresh help for renters is welcome, but this latest promise is meaningless if landlords can still force tenants out by hiking up the rent.“That’s why Labour’s new rights for renters includes controls on rents as well as an end to no-fault evictions and protection against substandard rented homes.”The proposals could have a dramatic impact on the buy-to-let industry, which took off after the introduction of the assured shorthold tenancy. The six-month and one-year contracts gave lenders the confidence to grant mortgages against properties where they knew they could repossess the property at short notice if necessary. But a three-year term is likely to make lenders wary about granting loans, or they may increase the interest rate to reflect the additional risk.The proposals on long-term tenancies will form the key part of an eight-week consultation.“The three-year model is one of a range of options and the consultation seeks views on longer minimum tenancies, which are used in other countries, as well as ideas on how to implement the model agreement,” the government said.

The importance of making concerts into events is something that Simon Rattle has brought back to the London Symphony Orchestra in his first season as music director.Stockhausen’s 1958 masterwork Gruppen für drei Orchester (Groups for three orchestras) involves no helicopters, but the forces it does require – three spatially separated orchestras comprising about 100 musicians all told, and three conductors – plus its sheer intricacy, are enough to make it a rare work to experience live. But this is as much an art installation as a concert work, and in many ways it was right at home in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall.Saturday’s two performances had a paying audience standing on the hall’s floor, but could be seen and heard by other gallery visitors from the windows and balconies all around. The work Rattle had chosen to precede Gruppen was equally at home here. Messiaen’s Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum, commemorating the dead of the second world war, is a monolithic piece, scored for a barrage of wind, brass and percussion.The public nature of the space felt entirely appropriate and the music made a forceful impact, but there were moments of quiet, intense beauty too. The final movement, with the gong pulsing, suggested a giant creature slowly breathing then the sound grew into a mass of noise that seemed to feed off itself. It was exhilarating to the ear. Gruppen is a different beast. For all its massed musicians, it is a thing of tiny, pin-drop details. The three stages were set up at the points of a triangle, so the conductors – Rattle, Matthias Pintscher and Duncan Ward – could have eye contact. Rattle encouraged us to move around, quietly, to gain different perspectives and so one found oneself perhaps next to the trombones as they offered gruff punctuation, or to the side drum as it tried to whip up the argument. The passages that worked best, though, were the moments of true surround sound, where the three orchestras came together to send single notes or chords scything around the space. Again, it was impossible to hear every detail – but if you wanted that you could have stayed at home with a recording. This was something different: a live performance, music as an event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61df10e831ed107b937445e3e33718b6ad63b714/0_0_4064_2438/master/4064.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be43948a64363bf9f692657b0a5327b9","title":"thirty years since the second summer of love 1988","story":"Three decades after acid house exploded on the UK club scene, Sharon Walker and her fellow ravers remember the blissed out spirit of 1988 and the second summer of loveIt was the year I got my first job, the year I broke up with my boyfriend, the year I flew to Barbados and met Imran Khan on a beach, but of all the crazy life-changing moments, none had more impact than the night I first experienced acid house, age 22, in the summer of 1988. I’d arrived at Heaven nightclub, underneath the Charing Cross railway arches, on a hot Sunday afternoon to find my friends had already gone in – you didn’t risk hanging back and missing your chance – so I joined the queue of kids dressed in the acid house uniform of Day-Glo dungarees and smiley T-shirts. I must have had the heads up on the attire as I was wearing baggy yellow surf shorts I’d just bought in San Diego, a far cry from the carefully curated layers of black that usually passed as a clubbing outfit, but other than that I had no idea what to expect.The minute I was through the door I was swept into a cavernous room of flashing lasers, dry ice and sweating bodies. After the self-consciously cool West End club scene I’d dipped into in the mid-80s, the club night Spectrum was a revelation. From the moment you stepped on to the dance floor everybody loved you, and everyone was smiling and swigging out of each other’s water bottles. Girls crowded around the mirrors in the bathroom telling each other they were beautiful. A girl in a swimsuit tipped buckets of water over her sweat-drenched body. I’d never seen anything like it. All inhibitions and barriers seemed to have dissolved in a heady mix of youth, summertime, the magical new music and, no doubt, a new empathy-inducing drug, called ecstasy, that many people had begun taking.It’s 30 years ago this summer that acid house exploded in the UK, triggering what’s now called the second summer of love and the biggest youth revolution since the 1960s. As a Mexican wave of parties swept through London in a rush of joy and unity, a new world emerged from the swirl of dry ice and pulsing beats, one that was to shape our culture and outlook for the next generation.As Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech echoed out over the dancefloor, the lasers cut in and a sea of hands reached into the air towards the DJ booth, I experienced something like a religious conversion. “This,” I thought, “is what I was born for.” Spectrum became my regular Monday-night haunt – that original party had been a monthly all-dayer – along with Future on a Thursday, both club nights started by the now legendary DJ and producer Paul Oakenfold. That first time I stayed all night and emerged squinting into the daylight, I went straight to my job at a fitness magazine with my ears still ringing, sure that I’d discovered this incredible secret.From that moment on, I was out every night in an underground playground of warehouse parties, sweaty basements, abandoned shops and derelict railway arches. Club nights popped up and disappeared again like shooting stars and there was always the possibility that the police would turn up and pull the plug or the sound system would cut out and then we’d tumble out into the cold night air and head back to someone’s flat.I don’t know how we heard about what was going on next. This was long before the internet and social media. It was as if there was a tribal drum echo on the street and soon I’d find myself in an abandoned coach station or sweaty basement in Camden locking eyes through the dry ice with a dancer from Cats, or a saucer-eyed plumber from Bromley. All barriers melted away. I met football hooligans who’d happily hug blokes from the other team as they “got on one” on the dance floor.Rave culture had ushered in a new era of weekday partying and my first priority was dancing: Spectrum, Shoom, The Trip, Future, the exception to the rule was Westworld’s Enter the Dragon, at the Park in Kensington, on Friday night, which offered a rare glimpse of glamour, with its tiered glass dancefloors, where models and Chelsea girls rubbed shoulders with Portobello market traders. Despite my busy school-night schedule, holding down a job hadn’t proved too difficult until my brother invited me to Ibiza where, after a weekend spent dancing on top of a speaker at Ku, under the stars at Amnesia and watching the sun rise on the terrace at Space, I called my boss on Monday morning to tell her I wouldn’t be coming back to the office, at least not that week. Two months later, I jacked it in to go to Goa where the party continued on the beach, dancing to electronic music surrounded by hippies who’d been there since the 60s.By the following summer, the genie was out of the bottle and the acid house scene had taken off in earnest with massive raves around the M25. My friend Tash, who I’d met on that first night at Spectrum, was working behind the scenes with a professional gambler called Tony Colston-Hayter on his Sunrise raves. It was her voice you’d hear when you called the BT phone line for directions to a secret rave location. There were parties in fields, at Didcot Railway Centre, in stately homes and, one memorable night, at a mansion in St John’s Wood, with a baby oil dance floor and a Rolls Royce in the drive. After the party, we’d carry on back at someone’s place. One day, after dancing all night in a field near Brighton, I led a convoy of cars to my dad’s house in Kent, where Norman Jay played in the garden.But the energy had begun to change. The tabloids had whipped up a moral panic in middle England and police vans would be waiting for us in fields as we drew up to the gates. The carefree spirit had gone out of it, at least it had for me. I got a job and started seeking out smaller, more grown-up clubs, like Graham Ball’s soulful Quiet Storm and Sara Blonstein’s glamorous Pussy Posse parties, which were incredibly creative, with their kissing booths, four-poster beds and “dating agencies”. You could say the acid house movement was pure hedonism, but bigger cultural changes came of it, as people began breaking away from the “greed is good” 1980s. That summer certainly had a huge impact on me. The bleak depression and feelings of isolation triggered during the last year of university, after a painful break-up, had lifted in the swirl of dry ice and smiling faces and, for the first time in my life, I’d truly felt part of something. Even now, 30 years on, I’m still drawn to that kind of optimistic energy and moments of connection and, like many of the friends I met that summer, it’s hard to stop me jumping up and down to an uplifting Balearic beat.DJ, 56, founder of Shoom, the club credited with spearheading the acid house scene in LondonThe inspiration for Shoom came from a trip to Ibiza to celebrate Paul Oakenfold’s birthday in August 1987. We went to this open-air, after-hours club called Amnesia where DJ Alfredo was playing and that was a pivotal experience. It was a combination of the spirit of Ibiza, the spirit of the people and this revolutionary new music, house and techno. We returned to London and sprinkled some of that Ibiza magic into the clubs we created. When I created Shoom in a basement gym in Southwark, it was a complete breath of fresh air. It was small and intimate and it attracted a group of like-minded people of all races, colours and sexual preferences, a mixture of art students, street kids and fashion people. It only held 300 people, but within a few months there were thousands waiting to get in.By 1990, the rave scene had deteriorated, but that first couple of years people felt like they were really part of a tribe. Acid house was completely inclusive, everyone was welcome and the attitude was infectious. I’m just very grateful to have pioneered that part of the scene.Danny Rampling is releasing Space Girl with vocals from Irvine Welsh this summer and hosting Summer of Acid at Club Paradiso in Amsterdam on 24 August. He is playing with DJ Alfredo at the Prince of Wales, Brixton, 7 July DJ, 59, co-founded the Boy’s Own fanzine, described as the “village newspaper of acid house”. He also hosted Boy’s Own parties with Andy Weatherall, Cymon Eccles, Steve Mayes and Steve Hall It was a brilliant summer, a beautiful summer. It was almost as if every week there was a standout moment. Everyone was so excited and into it. It was all about trying to do something where you’d go: “Wow, that was amazing.” All the DJs were trying to find records that would make perfect sense on E. So you had people looking for rare records from the 70s, 80s and even back to the 60s.I don’t think the acid-house culture ever really finished. Without it you would never have got garage and without garage you would never have got grime, so basically the biggest music in the world now owes a debt to acid house. Boy’s Own are doing a stage at the Farr festival, Bygrave Woods, Hertfordshire, 7 JulyClub organiser, 48, co-founded Energy, putting on raves for up to 25,000 people, with Jeremy TaylorBy the time we started doing the big outdoor raves in mid-1989, the police Pay Party Unit numbered over 50 officers and were following everything we promoters did. They even had helicopters circling the M25 on a Saturday looking for us setting up. Pretty much every party we did ended up causing quite a bit of disruption. Once we even closed down Heathrow when we set up behind Heston services. The police got wind of it and blocked all the approaching roads. People were parking on the M4 hard shoulder and scrambling up the banks to make a run for the fence, while police dogs were being set on them. It was pretty chaotic. In the end there were 10,000 people inside the party and 1,000 police outside. After that party, Jeremy and I were arrested by plain clothes police dressed like ravers in dungarees and driving a 2CV, with a smiley face sticker in the window. You really could not make it up.The Mirror labelled me an evil acid house baron and accused me of corrupting the nation’s youth, but I didn’t take much notice. We didn’t think what we were doing was so bad – a bit naughty maybe but not evil – we weren’t gangsters, we weren’t hurting anybody, and it felt as though people were behind us. Faced with a road block today, I think most people would probably turn around, wouldn’t they? What made us so determined? We were having the most unbelievable time, a unique experience, shared with hundreds and then thousands of people. Really nothing like this had happened since the 1960s.Tintin Chambers still works in the music businessClub organiser, 57, founder of the travelling art collective the Mutoid Waste CompanyWe were already doing parties in old warehouses around London when acid house hit. They were one-night festivals, with a heavy emphasis on the sculptural stuff, with cars hanging up, like a big adventure playground. It was this mad Disney World with no rules that was a Mutoid Waste party. Then Sex Two, who I’d say were the first acid house sound system in England, turned up and took over the old canteen block behind us in Battlebridge Road, King’s Cross. It was amazing: 5,000 people squashed in, raving away around a single lightbulb to Can You Feel It by Mr Fingers, an early Chicago house music classic. I thought: “Fucking hell, this is really something new. This is mad.” It blew everything open. Suddenly you’d have the City boys in their souped-up cars, the crusties in their old bread vans and everyone was on the same buzz. There was this weird synchronisation where all the different cultures and even the football culture came into it. We’re English and we’re very tribal – suddenly it freed us up from all that. Suddenly we were all on the same buzz, rushing away and feeling good and full of love. It was a fantastic thing, but in the end there were too many criminal gangs fighting over the action and that spoilt it a bit.People got too out of it on E, with brains like overcooked vegetables, and I think we paid for that. You can’t get enlightenment in pill form. You can get insights and moments of lucidity, but you’re not going to get it by partying every weekend, which is the same conclusion Timothy Leary came to with acid at the end of the 1960s.The Mutoid Waste Company has an exhibition at the Bruton Art Factory in Somerset, 30 June-31 JulyClub organiser, 47, worked on Sunrise raves giving out directions to the secret locations of the M25 partiesI was 17 at the time, so I didn’t have a job, but I was selling tickets to parties and raves to fund going out, which is how I met Tony Colston-Hayter who put on Sunrise. It was my job to update the 0898 numbers that gave out the secret locations, which we did for all the raves, Energy, Back to the Future, Biology. It was my voice you heard if you were heading to the big raves that summer.The location was always a closely guarded secret until the last minute, so that the police wouldn’t arrive and shut you down. I was probably the most hated person in England whenever anything was cancelled or redirected. A particular moment of pride was when the BBC did a story on the orbitalM25 scene and they played my voice, giving out directions on the news.Occasionally I had to change the messages on location and that meant finding a phone box, though I must have had a mobile at one point because I remember climbing on top of a bus to get reception and telling people how to get past a police blockade on the way into an Energy party. There was usually a QC on site who’d give us legal advice and on that occasion the security led people through in big groups, peacefully, and there was nothing the police could do about it. It wasn’t illegal at that point. It was only when the media started demonising the scene that the police started arresting people. If it hadn’t been for that summer of love, I wouldn’t have met the incredible group of people I’m still friends with today, or my husband the DJ James Monro who says he first clapped eyes on me when I was dancing on a podium at Sunrise, though neither of us can remember which one. Now James and I run a small charity in Brazil for troubled teens and one thing that helps us to understand them is my experiences as a teenager.

The zenith came in February, when the 24-year-old singer dominated the Grammys with five wins, a record for a British woman. She couldn’t be in the US, because of visa complications, but when Tony Bennett, one of her heroes, announced Rehab as record of the year – beating Beyoncé, the Foo Fighters, Rihanna and Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake – she was shown, by satellite linkup to London, staring straight ahead, mouth agape, briefly speechless.But there were many profoundly distressing episodes, too. Throughout the year, Winehouse battled her addictions to alcohol, crack and heroin, while a gleeful tabloid press documented every tumble from the wagon. Her live shows could descend into chaos and she was roundly booed at both V Festival and Bestival that summer.Blake Wood, then a 22-year-old proto-photographer from Vermont newly arrived in London, met Winehouse in early January 2008. They were introduced by their mutual friend Kelly Osbourne and quickly became inseparable – in red-top parlance, he was “Good Blake”, in contrast to Winehouse’s husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, who had not long been jailed for attempting to pervert the course of justice, though her relationship with Wood was always platonic (he eventually took legal steps to correct false reporting).Their friendship deepened and, on Winehouse’s invitation, Wood began taking informal photographs. After her death in 2011, he could scarcely bring himself to look at them, but now he feels the time is right for a different, more nuanced narrative of that surreal period. “A big reason I wanted to put this out there was to change the conversation about her,” Wood says of his new book, Amy Winehouse, a collection of 150 mostly unseen images, taken in locations from Camden to Paris to St Lucia, in 2008-09. “There’s a false idea that it was all bad during those years and it really wasn’t – I was there.”Wood, on the phone from New York, where he now lives, goes on: “This book, really it’s a love letter to a friend. And it’s a visual diary of us at the time when she was most celebrated by the world, but she was also really misunderstood. She was very much loved by the people around her, and I hope this comes through the work.”Certainly the photographs present a contrasting image of Winehouse from the one that filled the newspapers at the time, or from that of the doomed, self-destructive naïve from Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning documentary Amy. Wood says that he wanted to capture “the person, not the persona”. In many of the images she has her natural curly hair rather than the extreme beehive we are used to. The book is dominated by an extended holiday that Winehouse took to St Lucia at the end of 2008, which Wood joined her on for almost four months. Winehouse looks natural and healthy as she rides horses on the beach or exercises on a trapeze, and she appears totally at ease with Wood snapping away on Polaroid and old point-and-shoot cameras that he’d brought on the trip.By the time of the St Lucia holiday, Wood insists, Winehouse was done with hard drugs, but she was still drinking. Either way, Wood – who grew up around addiction but has always been straight-edge himself – didn’t want to document that aspect of her life. “It was this unwelcome friend she’d go deal with and then come back and we’d hang out,” he says. “I just had no interest in taking bad photos of her. Why take a photo of someone who’s struggling? As a society we’ve captured that, we’ve seen that, at least from my perspective. But maybe not. Maybe other people need to connect to that visually and they need to see it more. But for me, I’m good.”Before St Lucia, much of the time that Winehouse and Wood spent together was housebound, hiding from the paparazzi. They would watch TV, talk about their lives, sketch out their creative dreams once they made pillowcases from vintage T-shirts. “We were both outsiders and we connected on that,” says Wood. “When you grow up feeling like that, you don’t feel like you belong, that definitely brought us close.” Winehouse pushed Wood to do photography and it was her encouragement that led him to leave St Lucia and return to the States to pursue it professionally. “She really believed in my work,” he says. “She saw my abilities before I saw any of it. I didn’t really know if I was shit or not. But she pushed me to make work and it was really nice to have a friend like that.”When asked to pick a special memory from their time together, Wood selects the night of the Grammys, and the gathering of friends and family at the Riverside Studios, west London. There’s even been a suggestion that when Winehouse finally found her voice and made a speech – “To my mum and dad. To my Blake, my Blake incarcerated” – she was talking about Wood first and Fielder-Civil second.“I didn’t talk to her about it after, but you can jump to that conclusion if you like,” he says. “But when she won, it was the first time in my life I really cried from joy. Seeing somebody being able to experience recognition sober, they really deserve it, and to be able to really feel it. Just to see her whole family and how proud of her they were, to bear witness to that moment was really big. As much as it was televised and public, it was very intimate that night. It was almost like her own private ceremony.”Amy Winehouse by Blake Wood is published by Taschen on 27 July (£30). To order it for £25 go to  bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

It emerged that British aid programme providers should still remain eligible for many contracts, due to the UK’s membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an intergovernmental body. The contracts include programmes tackling sexual violence in Zambia.The UK’s aid sector is widely regarded as one of the world’s most effective and there are fears that the damage has already been done to providers and the causes they serve in dissuading leading organisations from involvement in key projects.The development is likely to inject fresh tension into Brexit negotiations at a critical time. It follows a series of rows over the EU’s Brexit preparations.Claire Godfrey, the head of policy and campaigns at Bond, the UK network that represents 400 international development NGOs, said: “We are very concerned that the European commission has misunderstood the eligibility criteria for UK NGOs to access funding from the EU in the event of a Brexit no-deal scenario. “There is a real danger that UK NGOs will be both discouraged from applying and be discriminated against during the process, if the proper criteria are not used. Ultimately, it will be the people who benefit from UK NGOs humanitarian response who will bear the brunt of this if UK NGOs’ activities are diminished.”Sources claimed that UK aid organisations working in Nigeria, Bangladesh and Myanmar had beendissuaded from involvement in contracts, although that could not be independently verified. A UK government spokesman said: “We are clear that this disclaimer must be removed by the European commission. As it stands, they are hindering British aid organisations’ ability to deliver the common goal of alleviating poverty, which would hit the world’s poorest people hardest.”The commission’s disclaimers are one aspect of a wider campaign to advise organisations working in fields ranging from aviation and haulage to the financial sector that the EU will likely shut down their ability to operate across Europe and block funding streams from Brussels in the event of a “no deal” Brexit.The note on the aid contracts state: “For British applicants: Please be aware that eligibility criteria must be complied with for the entire duration of the grant.“If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU during the grant period without concluding an agreement with the EU ensuring in particular that British applicants continue to be eligible, you will cease to receive EU funding (while continuing, where possible to participate) or be required to leave the project on the basis of Article 12.2 of the General Conditions 1 to the grant agreement.”A commission source confirmed that entities from OECD countries would remain eligible but claimed that the disclaimer in question was of a general nature and intended to ensure that UK NGOs analyse carefully their own situation, in accordance with the legal basis of their programme, before entering into a contract.The UK government has argued that the commission’s preparedness warnings are merely an attempt by Brussels to steal contracts from British organisations for the benefit of the remaining 27 member states.The EU’s decision to block the UK’s space industry from contracts on the £8.8bn Galileo satellite project, whether a Brexit deal is struck or not, has prompted threats that the UK will go it alone and build its own navigational system for industry, citizens and the military.The EU said it will not negotiate under threat. It insisted that the UK was a player in making the rules on non-EU involvement and should accept the consequences of Brexit.The bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accused British politicians of trying to pin the blame for the Brexit fallout on Brussels.In some EU aid and development programmes, UK NGOs would be vulnerable to funding streams being suddenly cut off in the event that Brexit negotiations fail but a large tranche should not be affected after 29 March 2019, no matter the outcome.Those include initiatives funded by the European Development Fund (EDF) and Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), which are delivered in Least Developed Countries (LDC) or Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).It is understood that representations have been made by the sector and UK officials to EU bodies over the aid contract disclaimers.The EU and the UK pledged in a joint report agreed in December to act cooperatively after Brexit in areas where the British government has made a substantial financial commitment in the past.A source with knowledge of discussions with EU officials said: “These warnings are in many cases legally inaccurate and are certainly an example of backsliding from the agreements the EU struck with the UK.“We hear worrying reports of UK organisations being blocked from bidding, rejected for partnerships and having extensions to good programmes cut short.“These legal notices might be a fun game for Martin Selmayr but they prevent some of the most vulnerable people on the planet from benefiting from the best aid possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91abbafa734ddfc272526f73e87f00a85b4f2be5/0_255_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7a0c52f61d1bb02d69d7573552f9fb8","title":"home dna test kits race ethnicity dna ancestry","story":"Researchers raise concern over white people misunderstanding their minority roots: ‘It has no consequences for them’People who use home genetic testing kits to unlock the mysteries of their ancestry tend to “cherry pick” the results, relying on preconceived biases to embrace some of the findings while disregarding others, new research suggests. Home genetic testing has become a multibillion-dollar industry that has seen millions of people around the world sign up for swab kits in hopes of uncovering the secrets hidden in their genomes. Researchers at Vancouver’s University of British Columbia focused on how the results shape perceptions of race and ethnicity. They interviewed 100 Americans from various ethnic and racial backgrounds who had taken the tests, returning to them 18 months later to examine whether the tests had gradually shifted how they saw their identity.“I was surprised to find that, for most people, they didn’t adopt the ancestries suggested by the test,” said Wendy Roth, a sociologist and lead author of the study Those who did heed the results did so on a selective basis, she added. “They didn’t embrace them full-scale – they cherry picked.” Participants tended to embrace identities that they saw positively or that they thought others would accept. Test results that were disliked were simply rejected or ignored in some cases. “So it’s not like people were seeing this genetic information as being definitive. They were really allowing their social desires and influences to change how they reacted to it,” she said.One of the participants who identified as a white Mexican American before the test was found to have Native American, Celtic and Jewish ancestry. Researchers found he embraced his Jewish roots over the other ancestries highlighted in the test. Another participant was adopted and had always believed herself to be Native American. After the test suggested she had no Native American ancestry, she dismissed it as inaccurate and continued to identify as Native American anyway. A notable exception was among some of the white respondents, who were more likely to embrace new racial identities as long as they felt others would still accept them. “They were really excited to try on this identity that made them anything other than just white,” said Roth. Some of this might be explained by the type of person who takes this test, said Roth. “Many of these people were looking for a sense of belonging. They didn’t know where their family came from, many of them were adopted and they were just looking for a place to belong.” The findings suggest that genetic testing could end up reinforcing race privilege, said Roth, citing the example of someone who has always identified as white but now, based on the test results, takes on a new identity as white and black, or white and Native American.“It doesn’t have any consequences for them. They can try it on, mention it when it’s to their advantage and ignore it otherwise. So it doesn’t have the same consequences as race does for non-white people,” she said. “That can really lead whites in particular to think that race is like that for everyone.”Roth is now carrying out similar research on randomly selected samples to see if the findings – which hint at the myriad of social factors that plays into our concept of race – carries over. “It really emphasises to me that race is much more complex than just information that’s encoded within your genes,” she said. “Even if they are getting this information, they still interpret this information in terms of who they want to be, how they want to present themselves and what they think society will accept. And then they chose to either embrace it or ignore it based on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5865253bcc3486eeb55a723f2d5848b8acdf352f/0_378_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b451d025fdbd3c7cd5b909f003d68fd","title":"tinnitus mindfulness new treatment study","story":"Cognitive therapy more effective in reducing stress, insomnia and hearing issues than traditional techniquesA mindfulness-based approach can dramatically reduce the impact of tinnitus, according to a groundbreaking study that will offer hope to the one in 10 people who are affected by the condition at some time in their lives.Defined as the sensation of hearing sounds in the absence of any external sound, tinnitus can lead to emotional stress, insomnia, concentration problems and hearing issues.While its cause is unknown, specialists insist it is not a disease or an illness. Rather, according to the British Tinnitus Association (BTA), it results from some type of change that can be either mental or physical and may be unrelated to hearing. There is no known cure but the study, published in the journals Ear and Hearing and Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, suggests the effects can be mitigated using psychological techniques.The research, led by Dr Laurence McKenna from University College London Hospitals NHS foundation trust and Dr Liz Marks from the department of psychology at the University of Bath, found that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can help sufferers far more effectively than the relaxation-based treatments currently recommended by many tinnitus clinics. This is welcome news for the one in 100 people who say they are left “very distressed” or “disabled” by tinnitus and the one in 20 people who report that they are moderately distressed by it.“We compared MBCT to relaxation therapy, a traditional treatment for people with chronic tinnitus, to determine if MBCT was a better option,” Marks said. “In total, 75 patients took part in the trial at UCLH’s Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear hospital receiving either MBCT or relaxation therapy. The study found that both treatments led to a reduction in tinnitus severity, psychological distress, anxiety and depression for patients.”But Marks said the study also highlighted a clear difference between the two treatments. “The MBCT treatment led to significantly greater reductions in tinnitus severity, and this improvement lasted for longer. In addition, 182 patients who completed MBCT routinely in our clinic showed a similar level of improvement.”Relaxation therapy provides patients with specific skills to reduce stress levels. In contrast, MBCT, taught by clinical psychologists, teaches patients to pay purposeful, present-moment attention to experiences, rather than trying to suppress them. According to its proponents, this is a more helpful way of responding to tinnitus. People learn how to “accept” tinnitus, rather than having to “fight it” or “push it away”. Mindfulness does not aim to change the tinnitus’s nature or sound, but the therapy can lead to it becoming less intrusive, to a point where it is no longer a problem for people.“MBCT turns traditional tinnitus treatment on its head,” Marks said. “So rather than trying to avoid or mask the noise, it teaches people to stop the battle with tinnitus.”David Stockdale, chief executive of the BTA, said: “The results of this research are extremely encouraging, particularly for people with chronic tinnitus who find that current treatments are not working for them. We really hope that more people will be able to benefit from this approach moving forward.”The researchers are now developing their work to see whether MBCT can be used to treat tinnitus-related insomnia.“The mindfulness approach is radically different from what most tinnitus sufferers have tried before, and it may not be right for everyone,” Marks said. “We are confident, however, that the growing research base has demonstrated how it can offer an exciting new treatment to people who may have found that traditional treatment has not been able to help them yet. We hope the results of our research will be one of the first steps to MBCT becoming more widely adopted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a287314abd9127392bd9ed6e55457a098230ad9d/84_0_3409_2046/master/3409.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05c3e32c5be69e43ca3dfc4f48697be9","title":"england danni wyatt t20 tri series new zealand women cricket","story":"• Wyatt hits 35-ball half-century to help defeat New Zealand• Sophie Ecclestone named player of series after tri-series finalEngland cantered to a seven-wicket win in the T20 tri-series final, stamping their dominance in the format before the Women’s World T20 in November.The 19-year-old Sophie Ecclestone was named player of the series, having chimed in with two wickets as New Zealand were restricted to 137 for nine, while the England openers Danni Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont were clinical in the ensuing run-chase with Wyatt hitting a 35-ball half-century. The win came with 17 balls to spare.New Zealand had opened the bowling with spin at each end in an attempt to stall the England chase, but the pair picked off the attack with ease, racking up 77 runs in the first 10 overs.Beaumont’s 35 made her the leading series run-scorer while, in a spectacular return to form, Wyatt dispatched to the boundary five of the eight bowlers used by New Zealand, hitting the only six of the innings and bringing up her half-century with a slog-sweep through midwicket.For England the only nervous moment came in the 13th over when the 17-year-old leg-spinner Amelia Kerr took two wickets in two balls to see off both Beaumont and Sarah Taylor but a 39-run partnership between Nat Sciver and Heather Knight saw them over the line without further trouble.Knight, England’s captain, praised her team for the way they approached the must-win match: “We don’t get to practice finals very often and with the World T20 coming up, the calmness about the group and the way we chased down the total with ease are really good signs for us.”Once again it was a collapse from the undercooked New Zealand middle order that cost them the chance to reach a par total as, after a 55-run opening partnership between Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine had been broken by Katherine Brunt, New Zealand lost eight wickets for 63 runs in 12.3 overs.“The bowling has been the highlight,” Knight said. “It was a very good wicket today but the bowlers have been very consistent and we’ve executed our plans this series on different types of pitches.”On Ecclestone, who bowled the perfect arm ball to take out Bates’s middle stump, Knight said she “gives us something different”, adding: “She’s very tall so gets some extra bounce. She’s matured a lot in the last year and become a lot more savvy with how she goes about her bowling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b74660d30ff0094f95402fe28704069a7633bc/0_152_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=440f7f208d92a487aaaea99a71476476","title":"lynsey sharp accuses uk athletics bending rules laura muir","story":"On the track Laura Muir was her usual brilliant self as she powered away to win the British 800m title in Birmingham.

Hamilton’s title lead has disappeared and the British driver now faces the herculean task of refocusing and bringing his best to the British Grand Prix next weekend.Nobody could deny Verstappen deserved the victory, the first time Red Bull have won at the Red Bull Ring he ran the race to perfection. As he showed exemplary control, pace and skill while managing his tyres, others suffered from blistering that severely hampered their races.But he did so while Mercedes fell to pieces in more ways than one on a day described by the team as cruel and brutal. Bottas, who had started from pole, retired on lap 14 with a hydraulic problem linked to the steering while Hamilton ground to a halt on lap 63 with a drop in pressure in the fuel system. Hamilton saw his lead of 14 points swing to a single-point deficit to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who finished in third, behind his teammate Kimi\u0026nbspRäikkönen.Yet Hamilton’s retirement was the culmination of a race that his team had already given away. After taking the lead into turn one, the British driver looked to have it in his pocket. But Mercedes once again made the wrong call when the virtual safety car was used on Bottas’s retirement.Ferrari and Red Bull took advantage and pitted but Mercedes kept Hamilton out. He had to stop under normal racing conditions and lost track position, emerging in fourth, behind Verstappen, now in the lead, Daniel Ricciardo and Räikkönen. Hamilton was frustrated and worse was to come as he pushed hard to try and make up places, overworked his tyres and was forced to take a second stop. He was at best looking at damage limitation but even that became moot when his car stopped.He was confused as to how the team had lost the lead, then frustrated he could nothing about it, and finally disconsolate. After the decision not to pit under the VSC, the team even took the unusual approach of having James Vowles, the chief strategist, take responsibility in an attempt to refocus their driver. “It is my mistake, just give us what you can,” said Vowles. “I have thrown away the win today.”The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted it was not the usual procedure. “It was about extracting what was left in the performance in him,” he said. “Helping him out of the mind-loop of: ‘How can this possibly have happened?’”The real problem for Mercedes is that it is not an isolated incident. The\u0026nbspteam, so dominant in recent years, have shown signs of cracking now pushed by a resurgent Ferrari. It\u0026nbspcompounds a software miscalculation that cost Hamilton a win in Australia and the very similar decision not to pit him under the safety car in China that led to a Red Bull victory for Ricciardo.Hamilton had not had a DNF since Malaysia in 2016 and Austria was a harsh reminder of the challenge they are now facing. “That was a major wake-up call,” said Wolff. “This is exactly how motor racing can go it can be very, very cruel and we had all the cruelty go against us today and it just got us brutally.”Wolff admitted the VSC decision had been the moment they had lost the race but that the team has simply spent too long considering the options, raised by other teams being able to split their strategies and leave one driver on track.However Wolff was insistent the team would not be overreacting. “No, we don’t need to make changes,” he said. “The most important thing is to understand why an error happens. I don’t think we’d make an error twice.”There may still be worse to come. Mercedes do not think the failures will mean power unit component changes at this stage but have yet to fully assess the cars. If changes are required it will raise the spectre of grid penalties later in the season.Hamilton was understandably concerned that the team ensure it does not happen again. “It is the hardest weekend we have had for a long, long time, we will discuss reliability and the strategy call,” he said. “We have a lot of strategists and I don’t know how we can make those errors but James put his hand up. We have lost a lot of points either through bad calls or reliability.”In front of them Verstappen showed great poise and technique to take the win, his fourth but the first this year. It could not have come at a better time given that the young Dutchman has been forced to face questions about his driving style after a series of incidents this season.Typically, he was not reading too much into it. “It’s just racing,” he said. “Sometimes you have difficult moments and then you try to work hard and you keep working hard and you overcome the situation. It’s as simple as that.”But he could not hide his pleasure. “My fourth victory,” he added. “I\u0026nbspthink it’s a good one, very unexpected. I\u0026nbspthink they are always good.”Vettel came away with much more than he might have thought possible. Having started from sixth after a grid penalty, taking the championship lead will have been beyond his expectations. It has now changed hands between these two drivers five times this season and will doubtless do so again.For Mercedes and Hamilton the first step in claiming it back will be to pull themselves off the ropes and making sure they are up for the fight at Silverstone.Final Positions after Race (71 Laps): 1\u0026nbspMax Verstappen (Neth) Red Bull 1hr 21mins 56.024secs\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspKimi Räikkönen (Fin) Ferrari 1:21:57.528\u0026nbsp3\u0026nbspSebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:21:59.205\u0026nbsp4\u0026nbspRomain Grosjean (Fr) Haas F1 at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp5\u0026nbspKevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspEsteban Ocon (Fr) Force India at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp7\u0026nbspSergio Pérez (Mex) Force India at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp8\u0026nbspFernando Alonso (Sp) McLaren at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspCharles Leclerc (Mon) Sauber-Ferrari at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp10\u0026nbspMarcus Ericsson (Swe) Sauber-Ferrari at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp11\u0026nbspPierre Gasly (Fr) Scuderia Toro Rosso at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp12\u0026nbspCarlos Sainz (Sp) Renault at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp13\u0026nbspLance Stroll (Can) Williams at 2 Laps\u0026nbsp14\u0026nbspSergey Sirotkin (Rus) Williams at 2 Laps\u0026nbsp15\u0026nbspStoffel Vandoorne (Bel) McLaren at 6 Laps.Fastest Lap:\u0026nbspKimi Räikkönen 1min 06.957secs on Lap 71."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14df56d8cb33e9afd53f91181f8cff1a22fd635/1654_633_3233_1940/master/3233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68dd46a8c4e1981a1560e9c7ef48d5de","title":"james acaster interview netflix series repertoire latitude","story":"Kettering-born James Acaster, 33, a drummer turned comic, has been nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award a record five consecutive times.

There’s also a hidden narrative running underneath that becomes apparent as they\u0026nbspprogress.Episode 2’s synopsis says it covers\u0026nbsp“light celebrity gossip” – about\u0026nbspwhom?Certain celebs manage to worm their way out of the spotlight and I won’t stand for that. So I’ve dug up some dirt on the Chilean miners. If you want the truth about those cult heroes from 2010, watch my show.In episode three, you compare Brexit to a teabag. Can you explain?The referendum was like making a cup of peppermint tea. You had to decide whether to leave the teabag in or take it out. If you leave it in, the cup of tea as a whole is stronger. Even\u0026nbspthough it appears that the teabag itself is getting weaker, it’s still part of a strong cup of tea. But if you take the teabag out, the cup of tea as a whole is weaker – and the teabag itself goes directly in the bin. That’s essentially it. You’d be amazed at how angry Brexiteers get about it.

You’re often on in broad daylight, with sound-bleed from bands. The audience might be sitting on the grass, chilling out and drinking. You have to adjust and embrace that, rather than being precious and fighting\u0026nbspit.Will you be sticking around for the rest of the festival?Possibly, but I won’t be camping. I absolutely loathe sleeping in a tent, regardless of the weather. If it’s hot, you wake up at 6am, boiling, sweaty and somehow panicky that you’ve overslept. You want to get out but you’re naked, so have to wash yourself with wet wipes before you can emerge. If it’s raining, it’s even worse. It’s gross. Why do we do this to ourselves?Your shows have had one-word titles. Will the next one be the same?This new show is a deliberate departure. It’s called COLD LASAGNE HATE MYSELF 1999, all in caps lock.

When the author published her second novel in 1813, she wasn’t to know Carly Simon would come up with an equally good title 160 years later in You’re So Vain. But that’s no obstacle to Blood of the Young in this raucous Tron co-production. Isobel McArthur’s adaptation merrily conflates 200 years of romantic-pop history and presents the Bennet sisters singing karaoke covers of Will You Love Me Tomorrow and I Got You Babe while standing on a beer crate in the middle of a regency ball. Naturally, You’re So Vain is addressed to the brooding Mr Darcy. Under Paul Brotherston’s direction, Michael John McCarthy’s score pushes the all-female production close to a musical. It kicks off in literary style with a lolloping skiffle version of Elvis Costello’s Every Day I Write the Book, sneaks in a Chris De Burgh joke addressed to Catherine (a lady in red) and draws on the love-struck catalogues of everyone from Chicago to the Divine Comedy. The culture clash is part of the joke, but it also places Austen in a tradition of heart-on-sleeve romance. The result is a have-your-cake-and-eat-it adaptation in which the gags are plentiful even while the stakes are high. Where Austen’s prose dances with delicate irony, McArthur goes for a sweary directness. Using the theatrical equivalent of footnotes, she spells out the financial urgency of the sisters marrying into money, presenting them as forthright, practical and single-minded young women for whom polite conversation is a chore and the social order something to be tolerated not embraced. Heritage-industry Austen it is not. McArthur herself segues superbly from a hectoring Mrs Bennet to an enigmatic Darcy Meghan Tyler’s Elizabeth (a “persona non-starter”) is witty and wry and even Christina Gordon’s Jane is no sap. With Hannah Jarrett-Scott and Tori Burgess, they make a sharp and funny ensemble, the cross-casting satirising the emotional constipation of the men (Mr Bennet is so taciturn he’s played by an armchair) while giving a transgressive yet surprisingly faithful rendering of a book they love more than they like to let on.

Our writer is also struck by the story behind a statue – and it’s not of a mermaidI arrived at Copenhagen’s Central Station with Danny Kaye’s voice blaring in my head. Maybe he was right when he sang about wonderful Copenhagen. When you get off the train, after a 15-minute journey from the airport you are greeted by the turrets and rollercoasters of a huge theme park. Within seconds of tugging my case across the concourse, all I could hear were the squeals and screams from the funfair rides of Tivoli Gardens (opened in 1843) opposite.This is Denmark, consistently one of the top five countries in the annual World Happiness Report and home to one of the planet’s most famous storytellers, Hans Christian Andersen. Now the country is pushing for hygge – its unique formula for cosy comfort – to be given world heritage status by Unesco. It’s much in evidence as soon as I check into my hotel, the Radisson, where I relax in my 18th-floor corner room with a cup of organic coffee and a fluffy cinnamon pastry. From my window I can see the whole of the city and beyond, to the bridge that connects Denmark to Sweden.The Radisson, opened in 1960, is a Copenhagen landmark: the “SAS” (Scandinavian Airlines) emblazoned on its tower harks back to the time when it was a glamorous airport satellite, complete with a check-in desk and departure lounge from here, passengers were transported by bus to the runway. Today, the departure lounge is a supermarket, but the hotel has just been refurbished and returned to its 60s heyday. It was the signature work of seminal Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen, who designed its interior as well as its exterior – even the door handles and the cutlery are by him. The lobby is dominated by a giant spiral staircase that seems to hang from a vast circular hole above it.Jacobsen was most famous for his chairs: among his best known are the Swan and the Egg, and there are plenty of examples of both, including some rescued from an auction in Oxford. The Swan was the designer’s bar-chair, a seat in which to preen and be seen the Egg is a nurturing haven to curl up in. While the whole hotel is a shrine to 60s design, true aficionados can step into the decade itself with a visit to Room 606 which has been kept exactly as Jacobsen left it.There’s more Jacobsen at the Design Museum across town, where a permanent exhibition tells the story of how Danish design became a world leader. There are more than 100 chairs – armchairs, folding chairs, wooden chairs, steel chairs – as well as ceramics, glass and jewellery from the 1950s and 60s.Design fans should also head for Blox, a glass-encased boxy structure that aspires to be a city under one roof with a museum, offices, gym, restaurant and housing. The first thing I see when I arrive is a vertical play area with parents sitting around in the sunshine, their children climbing through rope mesh and frames and whizzing down slides. The whole place is a microcosm of the Danish spirit and its urban inventiveness. There are apartments on the top floors, open-plan offices where meetings are in progress, classrooms where school kids learn about design, cool shops and exhibition spaces.Blox is the new home of the Danish Architecture Centre. Welcome Home (an exhibition that runs until 23 September) looks at how domestic space has been moulded to the changing realities of family life. Other shows explore Danish design through film and furniture, but the true permanent collection is the handsome city all around the centre. Blox is as appealing to locals as it is to visitors.The cafe spills out of the building across a huge waterside terrace local designers and artists sit discussing their projects at tables next to tourist families talking about the sights. On the menu, smoked fish smorrebrod (open sandwiches), a Danish signature dish, sit alongside Nordic dolma, kohlrabi and herbs – a savoy cabbage stuffed with cracked wheat, broccoli and lovage, topped with horseradish and sour cream. There’s also baked cod on caramelised celery root purée, and baked aubergine with haydari purée (bell peppers and feta) and to drink, there’s always Carlsberg, whose brewery in the city can be visited for a tour and tasting (entrance €13.40, beer tasting €10.70).The influence of Noma, the city’s most famous restaurant, can be felt all over Copenhagen (Blox’s other restaurant, Blox Eats, is owned by Noma’s co-founder Claus Meyer). Which is a good thing, because there’s precious little chance of getting a table at Noma: not only is the place booked up for the foreseeable future, but even to secure a reservation costs from a cool £265 per person. Coming soon are special student deals at £130 a head. Students must be a lot wealthier in Denmark than in the UK – but then again, everyone must be a lot wealthier. It’s a magical, delightful place, but life is expensive: even in the humblest cafe, a coffee costs around £4, a beer is a fiver, and a light lunch with a glass of wine can easily set you back £35-40.For a more affordable meal than Noma, try one of the city’s newest restaurants. Trio is at the top of the newly opened Axel Towers, apparently designed to look like a pile of copper coins. The bar overlooks the Danish Confederation of Industry building, which is transformed at night with a colourful light show – lumpfish roe and radish on a blini with a glass of champagne while watching it was one of the highlights of my trip. No trip to Copenhagen would be complete without a barge ride from Nyhavn, the colourful 17th-century canal waterfront district, which takes you to see a glimpse of Denmark’s most enduring mascot, the Little Mermaid statue commissioned in 1909 by beer baron Carl Jacobsen after he attended a ballet performance based on a fairytale by the same name penned by Hans Christian Andersen.For such a landmark, the sculpture is small and underwhelming much more interesting, for me anyway, was the recently unveiled statue to Mary Thomas, who led an uprising against colonialism in Saint Croix, then in the Danish West Indies in 1878. Her punishment was a prison sentence in Copenhagen, which she served a mile or so from the waterside plinth where she now sits triumphant, the only memorial to a black woman in a city where the vast majority of the statues are of white men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376dea68fe949ea1da7b303ac56da935560db097/138_0_3972_2385/master/3972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db925dec8df83442d0070efda3d6b558","title":"the misadventures of romesh ranganathan review high alert in haiti","story":"Celebrity travelogues are not my favourite TV genre, but if I have to go somewhere, I don’t mind going with RomeshDuring a clearout the other day, I came across a couple of carved wooden figures I had forgotten about. I got them a long time ago at the Iron Market in Port-au-Prince. I cannot remember whether they had anything to do with voodoo, but when I got home I did not like them as much as I thought I did when I was (probably) having a pathetic and (almost certainly) unsuccessful attempt to haggle for them in a hot market a long way from home. They went into a box. It is probably why my life has been cursed ever since.I went to Haiti because I was young and stupid and thought it would be an interesting place for a holiday. It was interesting, to be fair, but it did not feel much like a holiday. Mostly, I remember wondering what to do and pretending not to be scared.Romesh Ranganathan does not even pretend he is not scared. “Having spent the 14-hour flight imagining the myriad of ways I might get killed, I arrived in a state of high alert,” he says. Actually, I think he is pretending to be more scared than he is (he has got a security guard with him), but then that is his shtick, better and funnier than the other way around, the macho way. And it is sort of the point Romesh is going to the places others avoid because of their reputation. He is also going to Ethiopia and Albania. Albania? I thought it was the new Croatia!Anyway, he arrives at his famous Port-au-Prince hotel, which has scary voodoo figures in the garden (“I mean, that is genuinely terrifying,” he says, not sounding that genuinely terrified). In the morning sunlight, he cannot even pretend to be scared by them. “Look at that, there’s a penis with spines on it,” he says, pointing at a penis with spines on it.Romesh hooks up with local journalist Jeremy Dupin, who shows him around. They go by tuk-tuk, listening to raboday music (a sort of Haitian grime), to the area Jeremy grew up in and meet a few of his mates. It is loud and chaotic. And they drop in on Marinad 007, the raboday artist whose song they were listening to before. I hope Romesh returns the favour if Jeremy ever comes to London. Stormzy? Sure we can, we’ll drop in for a cup of tea … Marinad 007 turns out to be a man of few words it is a bit awkward. But he performs for them. Romesh gets involved and comes in with a few English bars: Oh my gosh, I’m here with a MarinadRomesh, and you know that I’m super badI’m with the mic, here with JeremyTo get me off the mic you’re going have to bury meI’m here, I’m not HaitianMy name’s Romesh Ranganathan.Ha! Love it. And that it’s not all about the history, colonialism, the Duvaliers, Tontons Macoute, but about what’s happening in Haiti, culturally, today.It is about poverty, and the 2010 earthquake, because it is impossible for a visit to Port-au-Prince not to be. And Romesh is clearly (certainly more believably than the fear thing) shocked by some of the things he sees. But he manages not to be hand-wringingly worthy about it. I like the way he is with people – not all overly polite because they’re poor and foreign, but just the same as he is with everyone else, deadpan – and if that sometimes leads to misunderstandings and awkwardness, well that is all right. It is – he is – very funny. And he gets a nice thing going with Jeremy – teasing, warm, genuine, that one I do believe. It is not my favourite TV genre, the celebrity travelogue, but if I have to go somewhere with someone, then I don’t mind going with Ranganathan.He does go to the Iron Market, which has been badly damaged in a fire (Haiti really doesn’t get any luck, does it?) since it was rebuilt after being completely destroyed in the earthquake. He gets a load of stuff: a small chair, seven brightly coloured scarves, good-luck shampoo, rum, black fish, etc, that he needs for the inevitable voodoo ceremony. Which takes place away from town at what looks like a lovely place by the sea. Obviously, the ceremony is absolutely terrifying … Is it really, Romesh? He is honest about Haiti as a tourist destination at least. It might not be for everyone. That sounds about right.My wooden figures? Well, they must have had something to do with voodoo, because I did what we do with unwanted stuff in my area I put them out on the pavement in the hope that someone would take them away. And someone did, since when things have gone relatively well. Scary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea6a75323d8fb8677152c207e6b43de1cdb6bfa/56_33_2326_1395/master/2326.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eebc1b9e5b1f07c696c099eaf7bade14","title":"british council accused of censorship over bahamas exhibition","story":"Council removed its logo from the show’s catalogue, saying its material was too politicalThe cultural diplomacy arm of the Foreign Office has become embroiled in controversy in the Bahamas where it has been accused of censorship and causing further damage to relations already strained by the Windrush scandal.The British Council was served with an unprecedented rebuke by the National Art Gallery of the Bahamas (NAGB), its partner in a major exhibition this year, which said the council had caused “distress and disappointment” after distancing itself from an accompanying catalogue over unstated concerns about its “political” content.Artists and collaborators in the project have gone further, voicing allegations of censorship and saying they were left feeling “stunned and angry” while the gallery described it as a lost opportunity to foster goodwill in the wake of the Windrush revelations.Ironically, the project in the Bahamas was the final phase of a British Council series called Difficult Conversations – reflecting on the UK’s involvement in the slave trade in the Caribbean.The controversy centres on a catalogue for a Bahamian show in which the work of local artists has been displayed this year alongside Scottish artist Graham Fagen’s video installation re-working the Robert Burns song the Slave’s Lament. It was commissioned by the British Council for the 2015 Venice Biennale.But according to the NAGB, the UK body took a unilateral decision weeks before publication to remove its logo and texts from the document, while providing little or no little explanation for the decision other than to say that the material was “too political”.Officials in London are understood to have been particularly concerned about a section of an essay by Prof Ian Bethell-Bennett, a Bahamian academic, which deals with local concerns about the growth of Chinese influence in the Caribbean state saying: “As Downtown Nassau falls into China’s lap.” The British Council has faced accusations of censorship in the past over its anxiety about offending the Chinese government, which has been described as “a chill on artistic freedom”.Following the British Council’s removal of the texts and its logo, the NAGB moved last month to ensure that the catalogue and all of the essays would be published, saying it would be naive to expect the conversation or writings around the artworks would not be “uncomfortable, confrontational or provocative”.The gallery’s director, Amanda Coulson, has written to the council’s board saying artists and other collaborators had also accused the UK body of “fiercely editing their thoughts and voices”. “A general feeling of being silenced and exploited is the consensus,” she wrote.“How this looks from our viewpoint is that a white Scotsman is sanctioned to talk about slavery – and is considered courageous and daring, fêted at the most prestigious international art event – but black people should stay silent because their feelings are too raw, too aggressive, and too ‘political’,” added Coulson, who stressed that she and others were not criticising Fagen.“That the British Council feels that it is wise to distance itself from these voices at such a time, shows a remarkable lack of compassion, care or – frankly – a strategic PR plan.”Gemma Hollington, the British Council’s head of exhibitions, said: “Firstly we want to extend our apologies. It’s clear that the artists feel upset by how we’ve approached this and we genuinely regret that.”“With hindsight, we could have handled this differently. From our perspective, the process was not us unilaterally telling them what to do, but working to make sure the essays were published in full while not affecting our non-political status. We continued to discuss with the NAGB throughout, and are still regularly in contact.”Fagen told the  he had not been given a clear explanation by the British Council. “The decision they made was for political reasons but my view of it is that they have actually made it political by taking their logo off it,” he said.Overall though, he believed that there had been a positive response in the Caribbean to the Slave’s Lament, which originated from his desire to open up the legacy of Scotland’s relations with the slave trade and the “deliberate or naive forgetfulness” around it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96082f08e02cf4bd103d5a21361042ef328567a0/0_162_2476_1485/master/2476.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28caab6143a8033df2dd10ead27632ea","title":"india railway stations art movement makeover","story":"Many Indian stations are a microcosm of the squalor that afflicts the urban landscape. But all that is changing, in an explosion of birds, tigers and Buddhist statuesIn India, 23 million people travel on the railways every day, and the stations are full of life. The poorer passengers don’t just pass through the stations – they sleep in them, cook meals on kerosene stoves, eat and wash on the platforms as they wait for unconscionably delayed trains. As a result, many Indian stations have become a microcosm of the squalor that afflicts much of the urban landscape.But all that is changing. There are now 80 stations (and some metro stations) across India where every throbs with colour and imagery. Indians who would normally never enter an art gallery now encounter new art by local artists or traditional art forms that had been threatened with extinction on a daily basis. The movement began in 2014, when conservationist and tiger expert Valmik Thapar wondered why Sawai Madhopur station, which is close to Ranthambore national park, home of the tiger, couldn’t be decorated with tigers. Why couldn’t people visiting Bharatpur bird sanctuary get off the train to be greeted with murals of birds? Why couldn’t the station at Bhubaneshwar, known for its crocodiles and Buddhist statues, reflect this heritage?Thapar contacted railway officials and, with the help of the World Wildlife Fund, the stations began to change. Tiger eyes now follow you through Sawai Madhopur station. With a few brushstrokes, a decrepit dump has become an open air, public art museum.“I’ve been visiting Ranthambore for 30 years. The gorgeous artwork is the best thing that’s happened to the town,” says Hema Maira, a retired teacher from New Delhi who frequently travels to see the tigers. “The pictures capture the essence of the park and its most famous denizens.” The railways project is part of a wider street-art revolution instigated, in 2014, by a Mumbai group called St+art India Foundation that has transformed the old Sassoon Docks in Mumbai and the Lodhi Colony neighbourhood in New Delhi into the country’s first public art district. (Brigitte Macron, wife of the French president, made a point of touring it during a visit in March.)“What we have been attempting to achieve is a freedom meant not just for the artists, who stand to gain a wider canvas, but also for those who would be able to appreciate art they might never have had access to otherwise,” says St+art co-founder and creative director Hanif Kureshi.Ordinary people are often shocked by the size and scale of the murals, which include a massive image of Mahatma Gandhi on the facade of Churchgate station in Mumbai. “They think it’s an ad and some fool forgot to put the company logo on it,” says Kureshi.Mumbai has one of the densest suburban networks in the world, with more than 7 million daily passengers, and 36 stations in the city have been given a makeover. In October, two NGOs, Mumbai First and Making a Difference, roped in 25,000 volunteers and artists from art schools to paint for seven days, with materials provided by paint companies.Rajiv Choudhury, Indian Railways’ station development director, says that about 80 of the country’s 3,000 or more stations have now been spruced up in this fashion. “It is up to the local communities around the remaining ones to paint those too if they wish.”And across India, dying art forms have been revived. A technique known as phad – paintings on cloth depicting stories of local deities, with every inch densely covered – is all over Jodhpur station. Udaipur City station has revived images from the Mewar School of Art, an important school of miniature painting in the 17th and 18th centuries. Jaipur station has been painted with Jogi art, a tribal form that uses dots and lines. Ajmer showcases the calligraphy for which the city’s craftsmen are famous. At Madhubani railway station in Bihar (which used to be one of the dirtiest in India), tourists go to see the traditional Mithila scenes from mythological texts and folklore that now cover almost every inch of the building. As the craze spreads, local artists are now getting work from the owners of cafes and offices who feel that one brightly painted wall might be just what they need.In fact, an unexpected result of the project is that the painted walls have drastically reduced the amount of littering and spitting. “People are reluctant to damage something nice,” says Choudhury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c047348cceec0be22370d1d3e916f48a6acd193f/0_80_4481_2689/master/4481.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dd3bfef0fbd4663d1c42d43bacabf65","title":"israel deploys border reinforcements as syrians flee strikes","story":"Jordan is also refusing to take any more refugees as Assad regime hits rebel-held areas in Syria’s south-westIsrael has deployed artillery and armoured reinforcements along its northern border with Syria, the Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday, as tens of thousands of Syrians fled towards its borders and those of Jordan.Russian efforts to impose a broad ceasefire in south-west Syria broke down at the weekend, prompting the Syrian regime to undertake fresh air raids. The government forces now claim to be in control of more than half of Daraa province.The fighting is in a diplomatically delicate region, abutting both Jordan and the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. As many as 11,000 refugees had already reached the Israeli border fence on the Golan Heights on Sunday, judging it the safest place to avoid Syrian air force raids. Some of the refugees were asking Israel to protect them or even annex the territory.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the humanitarian crisis in Syria during a Sunday government meeting, saying: “We will continue defending our borders, we will provide humanitarian aid as best as we can, we will not allow entry to our territories and demand strict adherence to the 1974 Agreement on Disengagement with the Syrian army.” He said he was in touch with the White House.Neighbouring Jordan says it cannot afford to take any more refugees and is turning away the internally displaced at the border. For the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, the retaking the whole of Daraa province would be a key symbolic victory for the regime, as it is seen as the cradle of the anti-Assad uprising seven years ago that spiralled into civil war.But just under half of Daraa province – including part of the provincial capital of the same name – still remains in the hands of rebels, and the UN is putting the numbers of internally displaced at over 160,000. The fighting in the Daraa province going on even though the territory is inside the de-escalation zone agreed last year by the US president, Donald Trump, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Jordanian government.Syrian rebel spokesman Ibrahim Jabawi, rejecting the Russian terms for a deal, said: “The talks collapsed because the Russians insisted on their conditions that want us to surrender.” He said Russia wanted the rebels to hand over their weapons followed by a return of government forces to rebel-held areas.A negotiator in the rebel-held part of Daraa city told Agence France-Presse: “All people who carried arms would be put on trial. The regime wants us to hand over everything – Daraa city, the Nasib crossing, ourselves and the heavy weapons. It’s inadmissible.”Syrian’s main opposition group, the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC), implored the international community to speak out against the violence, saying it should be clear to members of the UN security council that Russia and Iran “cannot be trusted to negotiate peace, since they are violating the agreement they themselves made”.“We call on the international community to condemn the brutal breaching of the de-escalation zone ... and take all possible measures to halt this assault on our people,” SNC spokesman Yahya al-Aridi said.It is estimated that as many as 115 civilians have been killed in regime bombardments on the province since 19 June.Aa many as 20,000 refugees are close to areas near the Nasib border crossing with Jordan, a country that already hosts more than 650,000 registered Syrian refugees and says the actual figure is closer to 1.3 million.Amman says it cannot open its frontier to any more Syrians fleeing the seven-year conflict, but on Saturday announced it had sent aid across the border to the displaced.Pope Francis has decried the intensified attacks in southern Syria, asking that people there be spared more suffering.In remarks at the Vatican, he said “the military actions of recent days have struck even schools and hospitals and triggered thousands of new refugees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a823ef78178104d57bbf2571af4af3bb9528764b/0_56_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79bc747ad3af9002dd5dbfd28ac0df1e","title":"italian minister aims to unite european nationalist parties","story":"Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League, wants to bring together ‘all the free and sovereign movements’The Italian interior minister and leader of the far-right League, Matteo Salvini, said on Sunday that he wanted to create a pan-European network of nationalist parties.Buoyed by his burgeoning popularity since general elections in early March, the 45-year-old said the “League of the Leagues of Europe” would bring together “all the free and sovereign movements that want to defend their people and their borders”.He raised the idea during a keynote speech in Pontida, a small town in the northern region of Lombardy where thousands of League supporters gather each year for a boisterous rally.“To win we had to unite Italy, now we will have to unite Europe,” Salvini said.Brimming with confidence, Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, added that the League, formerly known as the Northern League, which started in the early 1980s as a northern Italian secessionist movement, would govern the country “for the next 30 years”.He also said that European parliamentary elections in 2019 would be a referendum on “a Europe without borders … and a Europe that protects its citizens”.Salvini’s declaration comes two months after he attended a gathering of Europe’s far-right leaders hosted by Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Rally (formerly the Front National), in the southern French city of Nice. At the event, the group, which included Geert Wilders of the Dutch Party for Freedom and Harald Vilimsky of Austria’s Freedom party, launched their campaign ahead of the European elections. Le Pen, with whom Salvini has nurtured a friendship for some time, warned that a far-right majority in the vote could “change Europe”.The party’s anti-immigration policies currently have the upper hand within the coalition, with Salvini reiterating on Friday that Italy’s ports would be closed to all NGOs involved in rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean for the entire summer, a period when arrivals peak, and that those on board “will only see Italy in a postcard”. His renewed pledge came the same day the EU’s 28 leaders struck a deal on how to handle refugees and irregular migrants. The deal was reached amid intense pressure from Italy and after a ship carrying over 600 rescued migrants was forced to ert to Spain after Salvini blocked entry.Salvini said his government’s tough approach towards immigration and in negotiations with the EU had achieved more than its predecessors had done in six years.“The happiness of a people comes first,” Salvini proclaimed at the rally, drawing rousing cheers. Salvini asked rally attendees if they would “swear, yes or no, to liberate the peoples from this Europe”.“Yes!” came the resounding reply from the crowd.

Pre-ballot polls suggested the former Mexico City mayor would trounce rivals from the National Action Party (Pan) and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the only two parties to have controlled Mexico’s presidency since the late 1920s, by at least a 20-point margin. Speaking as she prepared to vote at a polling station in Mexico City’s Nápoles neighbourhood, civil servant Evelyn Correa said she was backing Amlo because she was tired of the corruption and “shamelessness” of Mexico’s political elite. “They know nothing will happen to them and the few politicians that are caught are just scapegoats,” the 44-year-old complained. Manuel Molina, a 34-year-old advertising worker who was voting in the Tacubaya neighbourhood, said: “This country is in a deep hole and he’s the only one that can pull us out of it.”Experts say Amlo’s success is largely the result his ability to tap into public rage at political sleaze and soaring levels of violence and present himself as an anti-establishment saviour set on fixing those problems. Mexico’s unpopular outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI, vowed to halve Mexico’s murder rate when he was elected six years ago but leaves office with the country on track for its most violent year in modern history, with more than 13,000 homicides already in 2018. In a recent article about the effect the security crisis had on the presidential race, security analyst Eduardo Guerrero wrote: “It’s the violence, stupid.”A record 130 politicians have been murdered since last September when the election campaign – which will also see nine governors, 128 senators, 500 lower house congresspeople and thousands of regional legislators selected – began.“I deeply regret the loss of life during the course of the elections,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, an Amlo friend, tweeted on Saturday. “I hope that democracy, justice and human rights prevail in memory of the deceased candidates.”Peña Nieto’s administration has also been blighted by a series of headline-grabbing corruption scandals, including an outcry over a luxury $7m mansion his wife purchased from a government contractor.At one recent rally on the impoverished outsirts of Mexico’s capital, Amlo railed against what he calls Mexico’s “power mafia” and vowed that once sworn in as president, on 1 December, he would no longer tolerate politicians who made gangsters look like “babes in arms” or saw public office as a golden ticket to personal enrichment.“He’s a populist, this Andrés Manuel, isn’t that right? Messianic!” Amlo sneered, mocking critics who have dubbed him Mexico’s “Tropical Messiah” and compared him to US president Donald Trump or even Brazil’s rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro. “I couldn’t care less about this,” Amlo insisted. Election results were not expected until late on Sunday night but Benjamin Moya Garcia, a rural worker from Xochimilco, said he was convinced Amlo had it in the bag. “We’re not probably going to win - we are going to win,” the 59-year-old celebrated, predicting: “Things will be totally different without corruption. I hope he doesn’t fail us.”Elena Hernández Guerrero, a 35-year-old fashion designer, had already started referring to Amlo as ‘mi presidente’: “He’s with the people, the poor. The others only care about the rich,” she said. “It’s just like he says: the ‘power mafia’ is on top and they won’t let the rest of us rise us. He will end all this.”Gómez described Mexico’s likely next president as a thrifty, upstanding man who would lead “a government of austerity and honesty”: “He finds it shameful that someone might be flaunting their wealth whilst others are dying of hunger.”But Gómez admitted ridding Mexico – which languishes in 135th place in Transparency International’s corruption perception index – of corruption, as Amlo has repeatedly promised, would not be easy and would require the full participation of society. “Of course it is a process … we don’t know if it will take six years, or 12. But we must make a start,” Gómez said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0116020b8fd17396fb6ce0034aae21934840d51/0_91_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a936ae1e10ef7c09124d84f73455de","title":"myanmar pleas for release of reuters journalists mount","story":"Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested over reporting of massacre against RohingyaCalls for the release of two Reuters journalists who have been in prison in Myanmar for more than six months are mounting ahead of a key hearing in their trial on Monday.Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in December over their reporting, which uncovered a massacre against the Rohingya. The men now face up to 14 years in prison for possessing classified documents relating to military operations in Rakhine State, charges they deny.The killings they uncovered occurred during the military crackdown that caused more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees to flee to Bangladesh, and that the UN has described as “ethnic cleansing”.The two journalists were detained on 12 December after they met with police sources at a restaurant and were handed the documents. They have held been in prison ever since, while preliminary hearings have been ongoing. Government prosecutors are seeking charges under the Official Secrets Act. Defence lawyer Than Zaw Aung said this week the court will hear an application for discharge from the defence and then decide if the case will proceed or not. The hearing begins on 2 July.It is a trial that has prompted outpourings of condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and even Pope Francis, who called for their release, saying: “The right to information is a right that must always be protected.”Local journalists have repeatedly called for the release of the men, holding rallies in front of the court with reporters wearing black armbands and shirts with the words “journalism is not a crime”. The prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has spoken out about the case, saying: “The outcome will tell us a lot about Myanmar’s commitment to the rule of law and freedom of speech.”Last week, Stephen Alder, the editor-in-chief of Reuters, called for an end to the prosecution. Speaking to the , he said: “They have been imprisoned for too long on false accusations.” Alder said the case was “a wholly unwarranted, blatant attack on press freedom”.Both journalists have remained optimistic throughout their incarceration. Wa Lone has become known for giving a double “thumbs up” whenever he walks into court for trial and Kyaw Soe Oo for using every opportunity to embrace his young daughter as he enters and leaves the courtroom. “I completely believe the truth will come out,” Wa Lone said in handcuffs leaving the court on 18 June.The trial has exposed the continued control of the military in Myanmar. Matthew Bugher, head of Asia Programme for Article 19, a human rights group that defends freedom of expression, said the government has demonstrated that “it will go to any length to silence those seeking to expose the truth about the grave human rights situation in Rakhine State”.Thirty-five journalists have been arrested or charged under the current government and local journalist Hline Thint Zaw Wai said the current trial shows that the government lacks the will to protect journalists. De-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently broke her silence on the case in an interview with the Japanese broadcaster NHK, saying the reporters “were arrested because they broke the Official Secret Act”.The case has been marked by inconsistencies and contradictions throughout. In April, police captain Moe Yan Naing admitted in court that the documents were planted on Wa Lone to “trap” the journalist. Moe Yan Naing paid the price for his testimony and was given a sentence of one year in jail for violating police discipline. His family was also evicted from their police housing.More recently, a police witness was accused of violating police code as he copied statements from previous witnesses. A witness to testify against the two Reuters journalists also failed to show up to court on 12 June.In May police took information from the journalists’ phones and submitted it to the court.Shawn Crispin, south-east Asia representative from Committee to Project Journalists, criticised this handling of information, saying it jeopardises the confidentiality of sources. “Obviously there is a grave risk that information taken from journalists’ cell phones could be tampered with or otherwise distorted,” he said.When asked for a comment on the case, the Myanmar government spokesman, Zaw Htay, was not immediately available for a comment. Previously he has said he trusted Myanmar’s courts would conduct the case according to the law.Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are the newest faces on a museum wall dedicated to political prisoners in Yangon. They appear next to monks marching for democracy, student protesters and poets who were imprisoned for writing prose against the military regime.“I remember when Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said one political prisoner is already too many,” says Zaw Moe, who spent five years in prison for taking part in the student protests.“They should not be on this wall,” Zaw Moe adds, shaking his head."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality   June 30, 2018LGBTI+ activists express concerns that the event is now more of a festival than a protest "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543076.1529934908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"michael viney the beauty of weeping beeches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWeeping beech: We found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. Illustration: Michael Viney The summer storm swept past in a hectic swirl of branches and I looked out at dawn to a polytunnel plastered with torn, wet leaves. But even on this bare hillside, so open to sea winds, our motley spinney stood firm. I am awed again by its billowing growth, nourished on extra breaths of CO2.The deeper greening of the planet, confirmed by scientific satellite, has encouraged much online enthusiasm. Even one large tree, I read, “strategically placed in a yard, can replace 10 room-size air conditioners operating 20 hours per day”.That would fit the beech beyond our window, now with an extra metre to its arching twigs and dwarfing everything around it in a great, green crinoline of leaves. But as a specimen of Fagus sylvatica, it may have a problem of identity.A tree can take a few years to show you the shape it means to be. Almost 30 years ago, wandering through the old demesne forest at Cong, we found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. A slow ascension in a sheltered corner brought its head up into the wind, green as a lettuce in May, fiery in the winter sun.Ten years later, at about 2.5m tall, its new growth surprised me. Instead of reaching for the sky, its slender twigs arched gracefully earthwards, a first hint that, rather than the common European beech, we might have adopted Fagus sylvatica pendula. Or are the branches just waiting to be hoisted aloft as the trunk piles on height and muscle?The weeping beech is the largest growing of all hardy weeping trees, reaching 25m or so (not on this hillside, it won’t). That’s long after a weeping willow has grown up and decayed.At Florencecourt, Co Fermanagh, there are “immense, round-topped specimens” of the weeping beech, along with the original wild yew, fastigiate freak from the nearby Cuilcagh mountainside and cloned for the sombre, columnar yews of churchyards.Half a dozen other Irish demesnes in the midlands count weeping beeches among their prized trees, and the named cultivars of beeches on old Irish estates run into some 25 variations of form, purple-leaved, columnar or absolutely twisted (“Tortuosa”).Moreover, England’s Kew Gardens have a remarkable walking beech, which is advancing outwards because its branches have rooted down and become a ring of young trees where they struck the ground.Our tree lacks the authentic, perpendicular droop and seems unlikely to start walking anywhere. It may be just feeling down at its singularity and windy exposure than actually wanting to weep (“even to a casual observer,” writes botanist Charles Nelson, “several different habits are obvious”). The arch of its branches does, at least, still admit me to its shade to offer the trunk a hug.Beech was typically a “big house” tree, but happily accepted by the surrounding populace as occasional “pin trees”, studded with pins and nails (later with hammered coins) in pagan, tree-worshipping rituals. But it never became a native.“Some modern ecologists,” Thomas Pakenham has noted, “advocate a kind of ethnic cleansing in which naturalised species, such as beech, are systematically hunted down and destroyed.”He might have been referring to some of those devoted to restoring and extending Ireland’s native woodlands, many in the remnants of ascendancy estates.In Management Guidelines for Ireland’s Native Woodlands, published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service, the beech is joining sycamore, lodgepole pine and rhododendron as an “invasive alien”.Authors John Cross and Kevin Collins point to its dense, dark shade and prolific seedling-scatter as a threat to the ground layer of woodland plants and the regeneration of native trees. Their advice is to “pluck out” beech seedlings in winter months, their identity marked by the obstinate, golden curl of their leaves.A national survey of native woodlands found beech in 69 per cent of them. But the guidelines are far from absolute in wanting them gone, if “mother trees” among them are doing no great harm. Indeed, their shade can help foster the growth of yews. And mature, even venerable, beeches have a value to the natural world quite independent of their beauty.At Clonbur Woods, for example, on the limestone shore of Lough Mask on the MayoGalway border, a restoration by Coillte has left some stands of beeches intact. Planted originally as part of the Guinness estate, part of their role in bioersity is to offer a home for the birds-nest orchid, Neotinia nidus-avis.It is a somewhat charmless waif among orchids, and its flowers are a pallid, yellowish-brown, and nectarless. Its leafless and parasitic growth depends on digesting a fungus that is part of the network of underground mycorrhizae that helps to feed the beech’s roots. The plant is also rare, protected and declining, with no duty to be beautiful."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550211.1530461653!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mexico election leftist amlo expected to cruise to victory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMexico’s presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: followers describe him in quasi-religious terms and detractors dismiss as Mexico’s populist “tropical messiah. Photograph: Ulises RuizAFPGetty ImagesMillions of Mexicans will head to the polls on Sunday in a watershed election that is almost certain to see a silver-haired leftist who has vowed to take on the country’s corrupt ruling elite elected president of Latin America’s second-largest economy. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City and a friend of UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, has put promises to eradicate corruption and fight poverty at the heart of his campaign and is expected to cruise to victory.The election comes against a backdrop of widespread exasperation with political sleaze and soaring violence, with Mexico on track to register its most violent year in recent history in 2018 with more than 13,000 murders already committed.For months, polls have given Lopez Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, a 20-point lead over his closest rival, a 39-year-old lawyer and yoga aficionado called Ricardo Anaya. “We can already affirm that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is the next president of the Republic,” Claudia Sheinbaum, a close Amlo ally tipped to become Mexico City’s next mayor, told jubilant fans at his final pre-election rally on Wednesday night. “I am convinced we are standing at the gates of a new era.”About 100,000 supporters had reportedly packed Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium for the rock concert-style jamboree – the final act in a punishing six-month campaign that has seen Amlo repeatedly criss-cross Mexico with his promises to wipe out corruption and pump the recovered funds into social projects.Outside, street hawkers peddled T-shirts and trinkets emblazoned with the image and the gospel of a man who followers describe in quasi-religious terms and detractors dismiss as Mexico’s populist “tropical messiah”. “Peace and tranquillity are the fruits of justice,” said an Amlo quotation stamped on to one mug. Another carried more words of wisdom from Mexico’s likely next president: “Outside the law, nothing above the law, nobody.”“It’s so exciting to know that someone is going to change our Mexico,” enthused Esmeralda de Jesus, a 21-year-old campaign volunteer who was among the crowds. “I believe in his project. I believe he can change the country. That’s why I’m with Amlo.”Marti Batres, the president of Amlo’s party, Morena, in Mexico City, compared the coming sea change to the dawn of the welfare state in 1940s Britain. “It is a historic moment. This is the culmination of so many years of history.” Once sworn in as president in December, Batres said Amlo would immediately act to pacify the country and help the poor by starting to build Mexico’s very own welfare state.Amlo’s rise has appalled Mexico’s political establishment, which – contrary to the views of most analysts – paints him as a Hugo Chavez-style autocrat-in-waiting set to cripple the country’s economy. At his last campaign assembly, Anaya told supporters: “This Sunday the future of our country is quite literally at stake – the future of a whole generation.” As well as the presidency, more than 3,000 elected offices were up for grabs on Sunday when more than 156,000 polling stations opened at 8am. Voters will also pick 128 new senators, 500 members of the lower house, nine governors and nearly a thousand local representatives. “When you think what people have been through in Mexico, the notion of some saviour coming along is rather appealing,” Riding added. “If you don’t think too much about it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550368.1530470887!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk s business secretary holds out prospect of longer brexit transition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State for Business Greg Clark. Photograph: Will OliverEPABritain’s post-Brexit transition arrangement with the European Union could extend beyond its scheduled limit of December 2020, one of Theresa May’s most senior ministers has suggested. Business secretary Greg Clark said during a visit to the port of Dover that evidence should dictate when Britain moves away from the status quo in terms of alignment with the EU.“At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run this very successful port ... in order to make sure that we can continue the success, and that we don’t have frictions, there are things that would need to put in place,” he told Sky News.“Computer systems, for example, posts at the border, even if they checked number plates. What we need to assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice, and then it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.”The cabinet will meet next Friday at the prime minister’s country residence at Chequers, ahead of the publication next week of a white paper outlining the future relationship Britain wants with the EU. More than 30 Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers have written to Ms May telling her to show “courage and leadership” and to stand firm against calls to compromise with the EU.“Our departure must be absolute,” the letter states. “We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation. Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”Housing secretary James Brokenshire said on Sunday that he was confident that ministers would unite around a common position at Friday’s meeting. And Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers said that cabinet disunity could lead to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. “The danger of disunity at the top of the party is not just that it makes the prime minister’s job more difficult in negotiations with Brussels, and therefore puts at risk the good Brexit deal that is in reach,” Mr Brady wrote in the Observer. “It also gives an impression of ision to the country. Electorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for ided parties. They rejected decisively the ided Tory party in 1997. If we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.”Mr Corbyn is under pressure from anti-Brexit groups in his party to back calls for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, as a poll showed most members of the Unite union wanted a second vote. Members of Momentum, the grass-roots group that backs Mr Corbyn’s leadership, have also called for a fresh referendum but the Labour leader on Sunday resisted the demand.“We have not proposed it, we have not supported it and we are not proposing it now,” he told Sky News.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

People are going to decide whether they want more of the same or true change.” Mr López Obrador was later joined by two of the three sons he had with his now deceased first wife, as well as his second wife and their son, 11-year-old Jesús Ernesto, who was named after Jesus Christ and Ernesto “Che” Guevara, and who he hugged to his chest as the media jostled for position.Things were far less frenetic when his rivals voted later in the morning.After queueing quietly for over an hour to vote in his home city of Querétaro, Mr Anaya gave a brief press conference punctuated by well-wishers who chanted “Presidente!”“Just positive messages today,” the candidate said with a fixed smile. Ricardo Anaya, candidate for the PAN, voting in Queretaro with his wife and childrenMr Meade voted near to his home in a wealthy district in the capital, after which he said he would be heading for mass.“Are you going to pray to win?” a reporter shouted out. “I will be praying for Mexico,” he responded.Over 100 candidates and officials have been murdered in the run up to the elections, and on the eve of the vote a drug cartel in Acapulco strung a message from a bridge warning that if anyone meddles with the electoral process, “we will come for you”.In a midday message to the nation, the head of the National Electoral Institute, Lorenzo Córdova, said all but four polling stations had been installed and that the election was transpiring without major problems.Even so, local media reported a steady trickle of violent incidents linked to the election, such as the armed robbery of ballots in a district of Mexico City and in the western state of Michoacán.Emerging from a polling station set up in a primary school in the working class Doctores district in Mexico City, Concepción Ramírez said she had voted for the PRI all her life but was now “voting for the tiger,” by which she meant Mr López Obrador.“I’ve lost all faith in the PRI. They were supposed to be revolutionary but they have sold us out so often and spent all these years robbing us,” she said.  “And if I am going to get robbed, at least let it be by other people.Turnout appeared to be relatively high, with particularly long queues forming outside the limited number of special polling stations set up for people to vote when they are away from home.A voter casts a ballot at a polling location in QueretaroGerardo Martínez, a 31-year-old archaeologist from the southern state of Yucatán, who waited six hours to vote at one such polling station in a public hospital in Mexico City, said he had grown to like Mr López Obrador over the years because he had “grown more tranquil.” But, he added, the main reason he had given him his vote was a burning desire to see somebody else in charge.“We can’t go on with this constant state of war, with all the disappearances of the people, with the mess that the PRI made for 71 years and the PAN made worse after that,” he said.“It is time to give somebody else a try. People are really fed up.”Ana Laura González, who is from Monterrey in the north of Mexico, was equally determined to register her objection to the Leftist\u0027s likely victory.“I voted for Anaya because he wants to take Mexico into the first world,” he said Ana Laura González.López Obrador wants to treat everybody the same and give people money even if they don’t work, and I don\u0027t think that \u0027s a good idea for Mexico.People line up to vote during the presidential election on a polling station in Xochimilco, Mexico CityStill in the queue, 45-year-old Eduardo Arellano, who works in bank security, said he feared a López Obrador victory would weaken the country\u0027s institutions. I think the people who say he will turn Mexico into the next Venezuela are going too far, but I think there is a danger that he could destabilize the country with bad populist decisions, he said. With Meade carrying all the dirt of the PRI on his back, the only real option is Anaya.In Ciudad Juárez, a border city whose life blood is trade with the US, voters were deeply concerned.After a period of calm, violence is once again soaring - the cartel-wracked city had in May its most murderous month in seven years – and opponents of Mr López Obrador fear he will turn Mexico into Venezuela or Cuba.Jorge Hernández, manning the polls, puffed out his chest and said with pride he was determined to ensure a free and fair election to end Mexico’s reputation for corruption.I\u0027m so happy to be involved, he said. It\u0027s so important.If we want something to change we have to vote for it. Our election is going to be clean - if I see anything at all out of order, I\u0027m going to report it.We have such a bad reputation internationally. I want that to change.Cynthia Pérez, a 23-year-old worker in a maquiladora - a foreign-run factory - said she was voting for Mr López Obrador to end corruption.“He can’t be any worse than Peña Nieto,” she said.They\u0027ll never end the drug trafficking. But I want one party to win control of the states and federal government, so at least they will work together to make things better, rather than trying to undo the other\u0027s work.When asked if she was worried about the results of the election, she laughed.“More scared than living here every day? No way.”Please review our commenting policy11-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after teenager stabbedRural families have a lower chance of getting on the property ladder than those living in citiesWinston Churchill was \u0026#39probably sexually abused\u0026#39 as a boy, House of Cards creator claimsThe Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan, review: a refreshingly different travelogue with a potty-mouthed Michael PalinMissing King \u0026amp I song  thought too racist for the movie reinstated for West End to make show less \u0026#39sanitised\u0026#39Theresa May risks collapse of her Government if she fails to deliver the Brexit she promised, Jacob Rees-Mogg warnsNHS will copy Japan by employing robots to assist dementia patientsBritish stealth fighters at risk if Turkey buys Russian missile systemSerena Willams reveals \u0026#39surprise\u0026#39 at Wimbledon seedingSalvini says he wants European association of nationalist parties as Italy leaves migrants stranded at seaVeteran diplomat resigns Estonia post in disgust after Trump encouraged Macron to leave EUAngela Merkel fights for survival as interior minister Seehofer says he will turn away migrants at the borderTrump blasts Europe for \u0026#39unfair\u0026#39 trade policies in Fox News interview as he says his parents were born in the EUEU threatens to pull funding from British aid charities in the event of a no-deal BrexitManhunt underway after notorious French gangster Redoine Faid breaks free from jail in dramatic helicopter escapeMoorland wildfires in Manchester and Lancashire were started deliberately, says fire service Fury sparked after 11-year-old Thai girl married to Malaysian manDemocrats facing an identity crisis as America\u0026#39s ‘Tea Party of the Left’ burgeons in the wake of Trump Young girl dies after being thrown from \u0026#39exploding\u0026#39 bouncy castleJohn Bolton says North Korea nuclear programme could be dismantled within a yearWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg","title":"brexit two years deal uk economy effects city london ashoka mody international monetary fund","story":"Created with Sketch.The message of the Brexit vote - and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since - was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitmentsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit is a done deal - but the social and economic wounds that led to it have not been healedAt the two-year anniversary of the Brexit vote, officials are engaged in fractious debate on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.They are wrestling with several thorny problems, including the fate of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But the political and media focus on the deal to be struck has obscured the real message of British voters. The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The research also surveyed almost 700 school leaders, looked at 10 years of Ofsted results and analysed how well Multi-Academy-Trusts worked.\u0026nbspReport authors Professor Toby Greany and Dr Rob Higham found the system had become less equitable, with higher achieving schools accepting fewer pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds than before.The report states: “The schools judged Good and Outstanding between 2010 and 2015 saw a relative reduction in the percentage of students eligible for free school meals (FSMs) compared to the 2005–10 period, while schools judged Satisfactory, Requires Improvement and Inadequate saw a relative increase. Schools that retained an Outstanding grade between 2010 and 2015 saw a greater relative reduction in FSM pupils compared to schools that were Outstanding in 2010 but that had been downgraded by 2015.”UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

The franchise would then be run by a state-controlled “operator of last resort” company staffed by civil servants.An estimated 230,000 passengers use Thameslink and Great Northern – which run from Bedford through London to Brighton, and Peterborough to Kings Cross station in London – every working day.The implementation of a new timetable had been expected to cause delays but chaos soon ensued, with cancelled trains\u0026nbspand long delays at train stations becoming routine.\u0027Extreme\u0027 heat to climb higher amid wildfires and rail disruptionRail bosses apologise to MPs over new train timetable shamblesGTR’s response further angered customers. Additional security staff were posted at stations on GTR routes to protect staff from unhappy commuters, while the rail operator appeared to blame a sole taxi company for disruption across four separate routes.Charles Horton, GTR chief executive, resigned in recognition of the company’s “very challenging times” and Mr Grayling has faced calls to step down, as MPs from across the House of Commons expressed their concern at the prolonged inability of their constituents to arrive at work on time.A spokesman for Govia Thameslink reportedly refused to comment on the reports about the possible loss of the franchises and instead chose to re-release a statement that apologised for the disruption.UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?“First the UK needs to decide what it wants, then there needs to be a discussion here and even if it is acceptable, there are processes that have to take place first before everyone agrees to move forward.”Another source close to the European Commission told The Independent: “Now we are looking at December as a more likely option, but there are questions about how much time that leaves for the deal to be ratified in time before March.”There is no hope really for October now. We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?In broadcast interviews senior figures also pressed the need for urgency, with commission president Jean-Claude Juncker calling for UK negotiators to finally “make clear their positions”, and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte saying: “I am not losing patience, but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement.”On the record Downing Street is still clear that the UK’s intention is to secure a deal as quickly as possible, with October’s summit the goal.Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumA No 10 spokesman said when last week’s get-together concluded: “We have always been clear the Brexit is a challenging process.“But we have made good progress so far, and are publishing a white paper next month setting out clearly what our future plans will achieve.”The food and drink staples at risk of shortages due to BrexitDanny Dyer’s rant about Brexit and David Cameron in fullWhy is Jeremy Corbyn staying quiet on Brexit?What do the ‘bad boys’ of Brexit have to do with Russia and Trump? Danny Dyer’s expletive-laden tirade on David Cameron and BrexitHowever, the view taken off the record by British ministers more closely corroborates the idea that the timetable has now slipped, with senior frontbenchers signalling that October has been becoming less plausible the longer the deadlock in London continues.December is also now being seen as the moment when a deal could most plausibly be struck, something supported by the fact that the government identified 21 January 2019 as a potential staging post on the road to Brexit.A proposed amendment to Ms May’s EU withdrawal bill, which has now received royal assent, committed a minister to making a statement to parliament if that date passes without a deal.But if December is now the new deadline, it leaves the prime minister facing a race against time in the new year\u0026nbspto win parliamentary backing for any agreement before Brexit takes place on 29 March 2019.She will need to win a one-off vote backing the deal and enshrine it in a piece of legislation, which both houses of parliament may wish to amend.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchRecent fraught debates and rebellions as Ms May tried to pass her EU withdrawal act have not gone unnoticed in Brussels, where officials are nervous that the prime minister may yet fail to have the deal they agree backed by enough MPs.But first the prime minister must secure the backing of Brexiteers in her cabinet, in a crunch meeting at her official country residence that should finish with the UK being able to publish its latest Brexit white paper, setting its goals for future relations with the EU.One potential source of friction, post-Brexit immigration rules, has been neutered for now, with government sources telling The Independent that element of Ms May’s future plans is more likely to be explored in a separate paper coming closer to September – but the vexed issue of customs arrangements still needs to be agreed by her top team.The Chequers meeting was originally set up to start the previous day, with only those who sit on the cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee attending.But with that group having already failed to agree to either of Ms May’s options for customs and leaning towards a harder Brexit since the departure of the more Remain-minded ex-home secretary Amber Rudd, the Thursday meeting was scrapped.Holding a meeting of the whole cabinet could give Ms May more cover to pursue a path which would see her keep the UK in a tighter customs deal with the EU and even the single market for good.\u0026nbspBut there has been some speculation that if she goes too far, then key Brexiteers – most notably Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox – could seize the moment and resign from her cabinet, badly destabilising her whole administration.Those close to Mr Johnson, whose name comes up more than the others, have rubbished the idea. Either way, Downing Street insiders admit that Friday’s meeting could well be one that runs into the following day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.“Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”In a sign that a longer transition period could be accepted across the political ide, those\u0026nbspcomments were earlier echoed by Jeremy Corbyn, who said he believed the transition period after Brexit would be extended.“At the moment it’s not set in stone,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “It’s talked around for two years.

Ms Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in Trump Tower on 9 June 2016 but denies the allegation that she went there promising information on Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. She contends that the meeting was about the US adoptions of Russian children being stopped by Moscow as a reaction to the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. Mr Flynn was named as Trump\u0027s national security adviser but was forced to resign from his post for inappropriate communication with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. He had misrepresented a conversation he had with Mr Kislyak to Vice President Mike Pence, telling him wrongly that he had not discussed sanctions with the Russian.Mr Kislyak, the former longtime Russian ambassador to the US, is at the centre of the web said to connect President Donald Trump\u0027s campaign with Russia. Mr Stone is a former Trump adviser who worked on the political campaigns of Richard Nixon, George HW Bush, and Ronald Reagan.The US attorney general was forced to recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation after it was learned that he had lied about meeting with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.Mr Page is a former advisor to the Trump campaign and has a background working as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch.Mr Gordon met with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 Republian National Convention to discuss how the US and Russia could work together to combat Islamist extremism should then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump win the election. The meeting came days before a massive leak of DNC emails that has been connected to Russia.Mr Comey was fired from his post as head of the FBI by President Donald Trump. The timing of Mr Comey\u0027s firing raised questions around whether or not the FBI\u0027s investigation into the Trump campaign may have played a role in the decision.Mr Bahara refused, alongside 46 other US district attorney\u0027s across the country, to resign once President Donald Trump took office after previous assurances from Mr Trump that he would keep his job.Ms Yates, a former Deputy Attorney General, was running the Justice Department while President Donald Trump\u0027s pick for attorney general awaited confirmation. Ms Yates was later fired by Mr Trump from her temporary post over her refusal to implement Mr Trump\u0027s first travel ban.The US initially sanctioned Russia over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its support for a pro-Russian uprising in the east of the country. Subsequent sanctions have punished Moscow for what Washington has called its malign behaviour and alleged meddling in US politics.Special prosecutor Robert Mueller, leading the FBI investigation into the 2016 presidential election,\u0026nbsphas indicted Russian firms and iniduals for allegedly meddling\u0026nbspto the benefit of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspMr Mueller\u0027s team is also investigating whether anyone in Mr Trump’s campaign helped the Russian effort. The US president has repeatedly called\u0026nbspthe investigation a “witch hunt”. The Kremlin also denies being involved in any interference.Mr Bolton said he did not think there was “anything unusual” about Mr Trump meeting Mr Putin.skripals and Russian security“I think the fact of the summit itself is a deliverable,” Mr Bolton said after talks with Mr Putin and other Russian officials. “There are a lot of issues to talk about that have accumulated, and I think this was one of the reasons why President Trump believed so strongly that it was time to have this kind of meeting. And as you can see, President Putin agreed.”\u0026nbspRussia\u0027s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is likely to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo within the next two weeks as part of efforts to set the stage for the summit.\u0026nbspMr Ryabkov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies on Thursday that Moscow has already made a proposal regarding the specifics of the meeting and is waiting for Washington\u0027s answer.Nato\u0026nbspSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg\u0026nbspwelcomed the meeting, saying that\u0026nbspNato\u0027s approach to Russia is one of defence and but also dialogue“It\u0027s absolutely, totally in line with Nato\u0026nbsppolicies to talk to Russia, to meet with Russian leaders.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Girls carry flick-knives and hide razor blades under their tongues.“We have to hold our spots (drug sales points) — it feels like there is no choice.”Her chilling account comes after The Sun on Sunday launched the Beat The Blades campaign last month in a bid to combat the UK’s knife crime epidemic. Nancy claims her experiences on the street have given her insight for an unlikely future career — as a policewoman.She said: “If the police want to know how to stop young people stabbing each other, they should take the time to get to know us.“I’ve met a lot of police in my life. Some of them are really tired and fed up. But some of them get a buzz out of stopping people and being violent.“The best police of all are the ones who try to get along with us and stay nice and calm.“I was in a park recently when some trouble kicked off and a boy I was with took a swing at an officer.“He got restrained on the floor but the officer stayed calm and made me laugh.“The boy was shouting something about me, and the officer told him jokingly, ‘What’s my wife got to do with this?’“It made us all laugh and stopped more violence from happening.”She added: “We are a generation who have grown up watching aggressive things on social media and playing violent video games, but so have the police.“Some people might find it hard to believe I want to be a policewoman but I know I could make a big difference.Words such as “skengs”, meaning knife or gun, cannot be detected by their computer algorithms, according to Barnardo’s chief exec Javed Khan.He warned social media is being used to manipulate vulnerable youngsters to make them join gangs – a practice known as “baiting the skets”. Mr Khan said: “This is dangerous because social media companies or the police may not be aware of the context and may not flag up the content.“Tech companies are simply not doing enough to protect children.”Nearly 80 per cent of Barnardo’s front-line staff believe drugs gangs use social media to recruit children as young as eight for drug running, knife attacks and sex trafficking.Met Police chief Cressida Dick has said social media apps and sites can “rev people up” and make street violence “more likely”.“If they had more people like me, there would be more trust and more officers would be able to build relationships with kids in their schools and homes.“It’s a long shot, I know, but I really hope I get an interview. We’ll have to see if one of the big police bosses is willing to give me a chance.”Last month The Sun on Sunday unveiled a task force including youth workers, community leaders and MPs to try to tackle the problem.It called for a ban on online knife sales, more community sports, specially trained school bobbies, a crackdown on middle-class drug use and help for child drug-deal “slaves”.Home Secretary Sajid Javid backed the initiative, saying: “I’m really pleased you’ve done this.”Nancy, who has had to conceal her identity for her own safety, was just seven when her mum disappeared back to Africa, leaving her to fend for herself for two years.She recalled: “I used to cry every single night, wondering where my mum was and praying she’d come home. By the time she returned I was a different kid — restless and insecure.“It didn’t help that we kept getting evicted. So every time I got settled we would have to pack our bags again.”BAIT THE SKETS: Manipulate kids to make them join gangsSKENGS: GunsBORRAS: KnivesNITTYS: Drug addictsNEEKS: Drug dealersCRASH CORN: Fire your gunHOOTERS: ShootersSPINNERS: RevolversPLUGGING: Carrying drugs, sometimes in your bottomDUMPIES: ShotgunsEASTMEN: East LondonersNancy was permanently excluded from school and said: “I don’t even remember why. I just had a lot of things on my mind.” In Tottenham she witnessed the 2011 riots, which saw widespread looting and the worst civil unrest since the 1981 race riots.She said: “If I close my eyes I can still smell the burning and hear the sirens wailing.“Tottenham was falling down. People were just killing people everywhere.”Nancy soon drifted on to “the road” — street slang for gang life — and was an experienced drug dealer by the age of 13.She does not attend school and spends her illegal income from drug sales on designer clothing.She said: “Girls play a big part in this life.“If you are a drug dealer, having a girl by your side gives you more protection from the Feds (police).“They can make it look like they are hugging or kissing a girl when really they are passing her drugs to sell.“It’s the way it is — if you chill with the mandem (male gang members), they will ask you to do stuff.”For Nancy, a typical day involves going to the bando (drug den) first thing to collect drugs before taking up a designated spot to do shots (sell and deliver drugs). On other days, the olders (senior, usually male dealers) send her out to steal mobile phones, expecting her to bring back two or three in exchange for around £200 each, depending on the models.Just like their male counterparts, girl recruits are expected to be loyal, punctual and never sample the food (drugs) themselves. Punishments for breaking the rules are brutal.Nancy said: “If you don’t give them the right amount of money they will slash you. Sometimes they send girls to slap other girls.“A lot of these people have nothing to lose — they will just box you up.”Some girls are used to cover up the use of knives.She explained: “They get told to stay at home and are asked to hide weapons — knives under pillows, guns under the bed. The thinking again is that they are less likely to be searched.”Nancy says some girls are able to escape gang life by forming relationships with more superior gang members and having their children.She added: “Their lives are lavish. The kids are in designer gear, they live in nice council houses and wear nice trainers.“But us ordinary road girls don’t want to get pregnant because it’s bad for business.“I wish there was a way out for me. It’s just the money that keeps me on the road.“Money has always been tight at home, I’ve never had any and because I left school early there are no other jobs so shotting (selling drugs) is better.“But there is a price. You can get beaten up by the olders and beaten up by the people you are selling to.“Someone I know had their spine broken and people have been stabbed.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Making my decision to go was the easy part, apart from telling my friends and family of course which was a little more tricky.I drip-fed them the information about the race rather than telling them straight away I would be alone and out of contact for nine months.The next three years which followed have been the hard part so far with so many hurdles to overcome before you even cross the start line.But I don\u0027t think the race is going to be a breeze either!I have no idea how I will cope with the lack of human contact or what it will truly feel like when I\u0027m in a low place and want to go home.I\u0027ve been planning what to take with me - it\u0027s all about the music.I can only use cassette tapes so I will miss modern music, although I have recorded some songs onto them as well as audio books.

The bridegroom already has two wives and six children aged between five and 18, according to local media reports. His new bride\u0027s impoverished parents are said to have agreed to the marriage on the proviso that she lived with them until she was 16. The groom is a scrap rubber dealer who is comparatively wealthy. On Sunday he defended his actions, claiming that he had not eloped and had married her with permission of her family.

UNICEF\u0027s representative in Malaysia Marianne Clark-Hattingh said: \u0027It is shocking and unacceptable and not in the best interest of the child. It is a violation of her rights. The minimum legal age for marriage in Malaysia under civil law is 18. However, girls can marry at 16 with the permission of their state\u0027s chief minister, while Islamic law sets a 16-year minimum age for girls and allows even earlier marriages with the permission of the sharia court.

The agency has reportedly been handed a cache of Banks’ emails, which reveal the Leave.EU chief was offered three Russian business deals during the Brexit campaign.  It’s sparked fresh concern Russia may have sought to influence the outcome of the EU Referendum .   Deals offered to Mr Banks included a gold mine venture in Guinea, West Africa and a stake in the privatisation of Alrosa, Russia’s state-controlled diamond mining firm, according to the Sunday Times.  Banks said he did not take part in any of the deals.

Of the National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation, Mr Banks said: “Let them investigate. All of this just makes me look like an international man of mystery.” The new evidence came as Nigel Farage, who fronted Banks’ Leave.EU campaign faced further questions over whether he prematurely admitted defeat on Referendum night, to help hedge fund pals cash in on the pound bottoming out.

Mr McCluskey will call for his union to back a motion at its annual policy conference in Brighton today calling for clubs and supporters to take a stand against the far right.  He fears elements of the Football Lads Alliance and groups including the English Defence League and Britain First, exploit austerity to whip up working-class anger.

The Premier League said: “We have discussed the Football Lads Alliance with the UK Football Policing Unit, and the Home Office. These reports are very concerning.”  The FLA was set up last year as an “anti-extremist” movement but has become increasingly associated with far-right activists. Up to 10,000 joined the Alliance’s first London protest in June last year. They also held a rally in Birmingham with anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters as speaker.

Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone.

The Sunday Times reports that at least 40 secondary schools have already banned skirts, with others consulting on changing their policy. Priory School in Lewes, East Sussex, have banned skirts after pupils asked why its uniform was different for boys and girls. At Woodhey High School, Bury, skirts were considered undignified and embarrassing if girls sat on the floor. In Bradford, several schools with a high proportion of Muslim pupils prohibit skirts on modesty grounds. The majority of schools in Ipswich are “trouser-only” and skirt bans are also common in Leeds and Grimsby. The moves come as the Government sets out the rights of transgender people in the Gender Recognition Act, with a consultation set to be published on Tuesday.  Philips High School in Whitefield, Greater Manchester, is to introduce a ban on skirts in favour of trousers this September. The move has been branded ‘crackers’ by one parent, who said there is nothing wrong with the existing uniform for girls. Girls due to start Philips as Year 7s in the autumn term will not be allowed to wear the same navy knee-length skirts worn by existing pupils. Girls in Year 8 to 11 will still be allowed to wear their skirts for one more year, but will then have to adhere to the new uniform rules in 2019. Mum Diane Burdaky, whose daughter Annabelle is in Year 8, claims parents were never consulted about the changes.  The mum-of-three, who attended Philips herself, told the Manchester Evening News : “A few months ago my daughter came home and said they were changing the school uniform and that girls were no longer going to be allowed to wear skirts.  It was the first I’d heard of it. There was no letter or email. No word or consultation from the school at all. “I looked on the website and there was a notice saying all new students from September will have to wear trousers and then the rest of the school will follow in September 2019. “I’m all for a school uniform policy. I think it’s very important that parents work with the school to make sure the rules adhered to. “My problem is why this has happened. I can’t think of any reason why girls shouldn’t wear them. “It’s good to give girls the option of wearing a skirt or trousers, but I don’t understand the need for a total ban. I think it’s crackers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how cool down your car","story":"NewsHow to cool down your car as quickly as possible during Britain\u0027s heatwaveMost motorists will be familiar with the stifling heat that can build up in your car\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCaroline JonesZosia Eyres17:08, 1 JUL 2018Updated18:24, 1 JUL 2018NewsThe UK is experiencing a heatwave - making cars sweltering (Image: The Image Bank)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe amazing weather the UK is enjoying brings many benefits - but when you factor a car into the equation, it can all get pretty unpleasant. Most drivers will be familiar with the sweltering heat that comes with climbing into your vehicle on a hot day. Sometimes you barely have time to catch your breath as you struggle to switch your Air Con onto full blast. Thankfully, the Liverpool Echo has put together a list of tips which will hopefully stop your car getting so hot in the first place. If all else fails - will be a helping hand with cooling it down.  How can I stop my car from getting so hot? It\u0027s not an easy task because, you may not have intentionally parked your car in the sun - but the earth moves, so the sun will move with it, becoming really difficult to avoid it altogether. Here\u0027s some advice from the RAC: 1) Park away from direct sunlight - the obvious solution but it might as well be said. The RAC said: Parking in the shade – perhaps under a tree or canopy – is one easy way to prevent your car heating up. If you have a garage, then use it. It will keep your car cool, clean and secure. 2) Use a windscreen sunshade - according to the RAC: A windscreen sunshade keeps the sun\u0027s rays away from your car interior – especially the touch-points, such as the steering wheel and gear lever. They are available from most car accessory shops simply tuck the shade behind the sun visors when you park the car.  3) Cover your seats - the RAC said: Most modern car cabins are black and that\u0027s bad news for keeping cool. Leather seats, in particular, can get uncomfortably hot and sticky – and may degrade and crack if regularly exposed to heat. Fitting light-coloured seat covers is one solution, or you could opt for lighter upholstery in the first place. As a temporary measure, a towel spread over the seat will help keep you cool. 4) Wipe down hot surfaces - the RAC states: On very hot days, the interior door handles, steering wheel, gear lever and handbrake may become painfully hot to touch. Wiping them over with a damp cloth will remedy this. 5) Keep the air-con maintained - it said: Keeping the air conditioning system maintained is vital for cooling your car quickly and effectively. The refrigerant gas will usually become depleted over time and belts may need tightening or replacing. Consult your car handbook and stick to the service schedule.  How can I cool down a hot car? If you\u0027ve not had chance to implement any of the above, then this is a good question - and the RAC has five suggestions to help with this: 1) Fan the interior - it said: Open both the windows on one side of the car, then \u0027fan\u0027 the interior by swinging a door on the opposite side back and forth. Providing you\u0027re not worried about potentially looking a bit weird, repeat this open-close motion at least three times to help expel the hot air. Leave the sunroof shut if the car is parked outside in sunlight, though. 2) Switch on the air conditioning, correctly - the emphasis being on the word correctly, there. The RAC said: Captain state-the-obvious has arrived, but just in case you didn\u0027t already know... Start the engine and switch the air conditioning to its coldest setting. If your car offers the option, select the \u0027external\u0027 air setting (the symbol on the switch usually shows an arrow entering the car), rather than air recirculation (a circular arrow). The air outside the car will be cooler at this point. Open all remaining windows, as the air-con system will take a few minutes to become effective.

Ben Gibbs, 40, grabbed the six-year-old girl from the water and rushed her to the side of the pool as shocked swimmers watched on in horror. The girl - who has not been named - was rushed to hospital after suffering what police described as a medical episode. Dad-of-five Ben was in the water at Windsor Leisure Centre with his daughter Carin Ryall, 21, and one-year-old grandson Finley when he noticed the young girl lying under the water - and not moving. Carin, from High Wycombe, said the pool was really busy when they got there with her mum Annabell and sister Olivia, at around lunchtime today.

A first I thought \u0027she\u0027s just playing under the water\u0027 but I said to my dad about it and within that time we noticed she hadn\u0027t come up or was kicking her legs. My dad rushed over at that point and picked her up. Her body was floppy and I couldn\u0027t see her face as her head just flopped forwards. Ben added: I grabbed the girl by the arm and pulled her out the water. Her lips were blue and her eyes were open. I rushed through the water and carried her up the ladder in my arms before placing her on the side .  Carin said: The lifeguards then evacuated the pool and performed CPR on the girl as everyone stood on the side in complete silence and watched. We were all just hoping she was going to be ok. They got her her breathing but then she fell unconscious again before the paramedics got there and got her breathing again. Police told us she was only six years old. Carin said the little girl\u0027s mum was really upset after the incident and police hailed her dad a hero. But Ben said: I don\u0027t really feel like a hero - I\u0027m just glad she\u0027s ok.

Now from 1 July, the fee that banks pay ATM operators per withdrawal is being reduced - and it is expected more will close or will start charging customers a fee. Link, the shared network of ATMs in the UK, is to cut the fees operators receive from banks when the cashpoints are used. The fee – known as the interchange rate - is currently around 25p and will be reduced by around 1p with the first cut. It will eventually fall to 20p. While this might not seem like much, operators have stated that some machines will no longer be financially viable to run. So this will mean more and more consumers will be charged to get cash out.  Link said the effect was expected to be a modest decline in the number of ATMs in areas where they are heavily concentrated but with no diminution in the overall geographical coverage. This will be reviewed annually. Which?\u0027s study found that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation found that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK. Which? said such closures would hit rural communities especially hard at a time when bank branch closures were also gaining pace. It said the closures accelerated as operators began to learn of the plans from Link. It has called on the regulator to urgently intervene and halt the cuts until a thorough analysis of the impact on communities is conducted.

Whitchurch High School in Cardiff could be forced to pay damages after pupils left a prized marble sculpture housing a picture of the Madonna and child in pieces while exploring Florence. The ornamental cabient, known as the tabernacle of Canto alla Paglia, was found shattered metres away from the city\u0027s famous cathedral on Friday.  A 15-year-old pupil was questioned by police for damaging public property before being released at 2.45am, Wales Online reports .   Another pupil was taken to hospital where he was treated for minor injuries after being hit by the debris. According to Italian website La Nazione , a group of the Cardiff pupils had been playing with an LED parachute when it became stuck on the monument on Piazza San Giovanni.

According to Italian news reports, the marble tabernacle contains a picture of the Madonna and child from the late 16th Century. It has infuriated many in the world-renowned Italian city with one blogger calling for the culprits to be banned from Italy for life.  Pictures from the scene show a cordon around the broken monument surrounded by shocked passers-by. The Renaissance painting inside the recess appears to be undamaged. On Friday the Italian Polizia Municipale confirmed damage to the monument had been caused by pupils at a Welsh school.

The incident took place during a five-day trip to Italy for Whitchurch High School\u0027s design and technology department.

Sally Osman, Royal Director of Communications, would be the latest senior figure to leave her post following the resignation of the Queen’s top aide Sir Christopher Geidt, who claimed he was a victim of a power struggle last year. In the past Ms Osman, 57, has led communications for a number of media companies including Sky, Sony and the BBC. She was brought in Clarence House as Communications Secretary for the Prince of Wales in 2013 on a six-figure salary. The departure, revealed by The Mail On Sunday , comes following a series of PR storms for the Royal Family around the marriage of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle.  Speaking to the , Ms Osman refused to comment on her position. She said: We do not comment on speculative diary stories. Any announcement about any staff movements are made in the appropriate way at the proper time. There is no suggestion that the reported departure has anything to do with the recent controversy related to Mr Markle. Yesterday, claims emerged the Duchess of Sussex hasn’t spoken to her father Thomas since his controversial interview with Good Morning Britain in which he revealed Prince Harry’s political views. The 73-year-old, who was handed a \u0026pound7,500 appearance fee, said the Royal was ‘open to Brexit’ and ‘wants people to give Trump a chance.’ He also discussed how his daughter told him she wished to have kids. Mr Markle also made headlines shortly before the wedding when footage emerged of him staging paparazzi shots which were then reportedly sold for \u0026pound100,000. The US former TV lighting director then announced he would not be walking his 36-year-old daughter down the aisle because of his precarious heart conditions.  The breakdown in communications comes a week after Mr Markle took a dig at the Queen over her meeting with US President Donald Trump when he arrives in Britain in a fortnight. He told TMZ on Tuesday: “If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me, I\u0027m nowhere near as bad. Meghan released a poignant statement after news broke her dad wouldn’t attend the wedding. She said: Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.

Having digested countless Big Macs over the years, reporter Sam Jones tried his hand working at the 24-hour restaurant in Skelton, Teesside.    From taking orders at the drive thru, to frying chips and cooking quarter pounders. Sam takes us through his two hours in uniform....      My guide for the first stint in the kitchen was crew trainer Dan Mortimer, a young man who has aspergers - a form of autism - but says McDonald’s has been great for him and given him confidence. He told me the clear workflow means he can follow everything efficiently and his condition means he always does everything “the right way.” After putting on my uniform for the day, the handwashing station was the first port of call. Staff have to wash their hands every 30 minutes and sign off whenever they do, which McDonald’s say is safer than wearing gloves. The first thing that strikes you in the back area is the pace of work - it’s hectic and demanding.  But a well thought out system, coupled with clever technology brings organisation to the chaos. Sophisticated screens calculate how many people are in the store and inform staff of how much food they need to have prepared, although this can be adjusted by the manager.  Watching Dan make a Big Mac at the prepping station seemed simple enough - or so I thought.  Two quick orders flashed up on the screen and it was my time to shine! Getting each section of the bun into the right toasting slot is the first challenge which, despite seeming simple enough, takes a bit of practice.  A squirt of the company’s famous Big Mac sauce follows before you grab a dash of onions, some lettuce and a couple of gherkins. A slice of cheese is next, followed by the beef, then comes the tricky bit, piecing it all together, which despite seeming like a jigsaw puzzle at first, gets easier with practice. Dan then challenged me to a competition to see who could make the best one - I’d argue mine was better, although I’m sure he’d disagree - either way, they both set off down a conveyor belt chute to be served to diners. It’s easy to forget when you collect your order what it takes to put a burger together - each one is carefully constructed and brought out nice and fresh.  Learning how to fry the fries No trip to McDonald’s is complete without the chips (I won’t get into the debate of whether you should eat them or the burger first - it’s definitely the burger first). Thankfully for me, the process of cooking them is simple enough. Their journey begins in the freezer before spending a couple of minutes in hot oil in the fryer, they’re then poured into a heated area with care taken to stock rotate and move the older ones along into another section.  A sprinkle of salt and they’re ready to go. I wasn’t quite as fast as the pros when it came to boxing them up, but Dan assured me it gets easier with practice! So much technology keeps the drive thru moving  Perhaps one of the most fascinating things about my time spent in McDonald’s was the drive thru - so much technology makes it as efficient as possible. My guide to the takeout side of the business was Jola Peters, a crew trainer who serves every customer with a smile. Have you ever wondered how your order never gets mixed up when you order at the same time as a car next to you? Well the answer is the system takes a picture of you when you order - something I was slightly alarmed to find out given some of the states I’ve looked when pulling up at the ordering point! The thinking behind it is to ensure that orders do not get confused - when customers come to the window to pay you can check you’re serving the right person.  The cash machine even does the change for you to avoid mistakes and speed up the whole process. After a couple of miserable attempts at taking orders over a headset, I left it to Jola and set about investigating how the whole system works. The drive-thru is split into three key areas which is monitored closely by a computer system - where you order, the cashier and the presenter. Working to the computer targets, staff have 30 seconds to take the order, 20 seconds to take payment and 20 seconds to present the driver with their meal. All of this is monitored on a screen which compares how the store is performing with others in the Middlesbrough area. During my time in Skelton, the restaurant was sitting in first place, closely followed by Eston. “It’s not that we are competitive, but we like to be at the top,” said store manager Louise Probert. How the operation has changed over the years  So much has changed since Louise started working for the company as a 16-year-old in Hartlepool. In her 22 years of service she’s seen the business transform: “When I started we had to use microwaves, it’s completely changed through the years. “Even the drive-thru, we used to serve at the window, now it’s through head sets. “We introduced table service and the customers absolutely love it.” Her route to management saw her climb the ladder internally before later doing a degree alongside her job. “I never went to uni,” she explained. “I did the degree programme through Mcdonald’s and I graduated in 2016 - my kids got to see it and Mcdonald’s were fantastic with it.” Flexibility  The flexibility offered to consultant Leanne Norman, who manages nine stores in the Teesside area, has been helpful after her daughter was diagnosed with autism. “I have to go to quite a lot of appointments, so I went down to four days a week and McDonald’s has been very supportive,” she said. “My parents are really proud of me making a career out of it.” The company has been a big part of Leanne’s life - who also joined aged 16. She met her husband while working there, recently won an award which meant she got the chance to travel to Florida and in the last week climbed Ben Nevis in support of Ronald McDonald House Charities. ‘I have a great amount of respect for the staff’ "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather heatwave last another","story":"NewsUK weather: Heatwave to last another MONTH with glorious sunshine despite threat of thunderstormsPeople in parts of the country are set to enjoy temperatures of a sweltering 30C today - and forecasters say the great weather will continue\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans11:10, 1 JUL 2018Updated11:31, 1 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Britain\u0027s heatwave is set to last another MONTH - with even more glorious sunshine, high temperatures and dry conditions, forecasters say.   The country is currently basking in very warm weather , despite the imminent threat of thunderstorms, torrential rain and hail in some areas.  Parts of the Midlands and London are expected to enjoy temperatures of 30C today, with higher levels of humidity than in previous days. And the great weather is set to continue throughout Wimbledon and likely for a further two weeks after that, according to forecasters. Today is expected to be a very warm or hot day for most of the country, with tomorrow also set to see extremely warm conditions and sunshine.  However, there could be showers across south-west England, where there will also be more extensive cloud cover, MeteoGroup UK says. Tuesday is set to be mostly dry with sunny spells, while Wednesday will be very warm for all - with the risk of thundery showers in places, it adds. Towards the end of the working week, temperatures are expected to remain well above average in many places, with hot conditions and warm nights.  Next weekend, it appears that high pressure will build from the Atlantic, with much of the UK staying dry and very warm, the Met Office says .  At present, the following week is also expected to see dry, settled and very warm conditions in central and southern areas, with rain possible at times.  The weather service adds: For the rest of July, the most likely scenario is that the fine weather looks set to predominate across the UK, with mostly dry, sunny and warm conditions, especially in the south. However, there are likely to be interludes of less settled weather, with some rain at times, especially across the far north and northwest of the country. Temperatures overall are likely to be above average during the second half of July, with some further very warm spells possible. However, temperatures may return to near average at times, particularly in any changeable spells of weather. Met Office meteorologist Helen Roberts said the good weather is set to last throughout Wimbledon, with just a few showers at times.  The first day of the tournament is expected to see 27C temperatures.  Speaking to the Evening Standard , Ms Roberts added that high pressure is expected across the country for the whole of the month.  There will be lots of dry, sunny and warm weather, she said.  According to the BBC weather forecast, the lowest maximum temperature over the next fortnight is an amazing 26C - on July 13.  It comes as the Met Office has issued a weather warning for thunderstorms - the first such advisory since the service was introduced.

The child, believed to be about four, died after being thrown \u002720ft in the air\u0027 when the trampoline \u0027exploded in the heat\u0027 on Gorleston beach. A lifeguard performed CPR on the girl, who has not been named, for 15 minutes before she was taken to James Paget Hospital. Norfolk Police said she later died from her injuries after the tragedy on the beach’s Lower Esplanade. The piece of equipment had initially been described as a bouncy castle but it is understand to have been an inflatable trampoline.  Passerby Karen Sell said she heard the most enormous bang as she was walking by the beach this morning. Kayla-ann Weaver, who was sitting only metres away from the accident, said she heard a big bang before seeing paramedics rush onto the scene and carry out CPR on the girl. She added: I was right next to it the girls wanted to go on it I said no. I was sat next to it behind the barrier and I just heard a big bang and I turn around and a little girl in pink flew up and back down. They did CPR on her straight away. She looked a lot younger than four-years-old. It is terrible. Cherish every moment you never know what could happen in a blink of an eye. Never ever will I let my girls on a bouncy castle ever. My thoughts are with the little girl\u0027s family. Another witness Kara Longshaw said: Just seen the most horrific thing in my life. A bouncy castle exploded at the beach and the child on it was catapulted about 20ft into the air.  PLEASE do not allow your children on a bouncy castle in this heat and PLEASE say a prayer for the 4 year old being rushed to hospital after 15 minutes of CPR. Totally heartbroken to hear that the little girl didn’t make it. Thoughts and prayers go out to her family. Karen Sell who was leaving the beach at the time, said: I was walking away from the beach and I heard the most enormous bang and straight away turned round. I was at the top of the stairs near the cliff that overlooks the beach and people were all there and everyone was in shock. I spoke to someone who described how the girl was just thrown about 20ft into the air and landed on the floor. It was just terrible. A man was giving the girl CPR for quite a while before they took her hospital. The bouncy castle was not like one I have seen before- It was like a trampoline so you could jump a lot higher on it than a normal one. It is such a sad situation. Katie Harrison, also said: Feeling incredibly sad about the news of the little girl on Gorleston beach. Thoughts are with the girls heartbroken family. Devastating. Cannot imagine what the family are going through.  Cllr Barbara Wright, who represents St Andrew\u0027s Ward on Great Yarmouth Borough Council, described the incident as a \u0027terrible tragedy\u0027. She said: Since I found out I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about that little girl. On Wednesday we had 6,000 people down there and everything was fine and then for this to happen to a little girl is unbelievable. It is a terrible thing to happen on such a sunny day. Emergency services were called to the Norfolk beach after receiving a number of calls at around 11.15am. Shocked witnesses also described on social media seeing the accident. One wrote: Inflatable trampoline just exploded on Gorleston beach with children on it. Another said: Just seen the most horrific thing in my life. A bouncy castle exploded at the beach and the child on it was catapulted about 20ft into the air. Please do not allow your children on a bouncy castle in this heat. The girl was rushed to James Paget Hospital but Norfolk Police confirmed at around 2.15pm that she had died. The incident occurred on a site operated by Bounce About consisting of four different inflatables.  Owner Curt Johnson, 47, who was not present at the time of the incident, told  it happened on an inflatable trampoline measuring 10 metres by four metres and exploded because of the heat. He said: “It is very upsetting. An inflatable trampoline exploded because of the heat and that is all I know. “We have been at the beach for a very long time, definitely a number of years and it is the first accident we have had there and it is quite shocking. The girl\u0027s parents have been informed. The force said in a statement on its website: Officers were called to Lower Esplanade around 11.15am following reports a child had been thrown from a bouncy castle The young girl was taken to the James Paget Hospital however sadly died.

Limbani keeps his arms wrapped around the man\u0027s neck and his legs around his waist, like a small child.  Jorge strokes the ape\u0027s head and then leans back to give him a kiss on the face.

They really are sorely needed.“There were a couple of concerns raised about the roads being put in, but almost all the feedback I’ve heard has been positive.“I’ve heard a lot of people saying they hoped they would get one.“It will secure the site, too, which is good as it’s been used as a bit of a drinking den for teenagers of late. But I really am delighted.”Abertay has already completed similar developments to the east and north of the site, with the brief of creating an array of attractive and affordable homes in the area.In a report included with the application, the firm said the new homes would be a good fit for the area due to its proximity to Charleston Community Centre and nearby shops and schools.Pupils were relocated from Charleston Primary in 2013, joining those from Lochee Primary at the new Camperdown campus.The building was later demolished at a cost of £150,000.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/SNS-15161584-Dundee-UTD-Train.jpg-838x564.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

The Dundee branch opened in April and we pride ourselves on offering specialised treatments while ensuring our clients feel at ease.“My role as clinic manager involves greeting our clients and making sure they are happy and also diary management which is a massive part of my day-to-day work in this very fast-paced clinic.”Treatments including botox and fillers can only be performed by a qualified prescribing nurse or a fully qualified doctor.Christine said: “We want to make sure the clients receive the best and safest treatments, that is why our procedures are carried out by professionals.“It builds trust with our clients but it also ensures safety that these practitioners know what they are doing and that is the most important thing.“We always urge people to come in for their free consultation so they can feel at ease here and can be talked through every step of the procedure.“Our practitioners will also talk through the treatments while they are happening so the client knows they are always in control. It is all about them.”When it comes to her job Christine is positive she wouldn’t want to work anywhere else.“It really makes my day when you see someone who has came in with low self confidence and after their skin peel or botox you can see how happy they are and how much confidence they have gained.“A lot of our clients have acne and after they have had their skin peel treatments you can just see the change in them, its amazing.

I always say to my friends ‘who wouldn’t want to work for Therapie?’.“Therapie Clinic is a fantastic place to work and I would urge anyone who is a qualified beauty therapist looking to get into this kind of role to look at positions available.”Therapie Clinic also offers laser hair removal and skin treatment which has allowed it to become Europe’s number one in the field.“These procedures are carried out by highly trained staff,” Christine said.“All of our practitioners have been fully qualified beauty therapists first and foremost. They are then given training through Therapie Clinic’s own training.“During this time they will be given a theory exam and a practical assessment which they must pass to be employed.“The only reason someone would fail is due to safety.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united coach ian cathro teams up with former boss at wolves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Hearts boss Ian Cathro has been appointed first-team coach of Premier League newcomers Wolves.Dundonian Cathro, who spent eight months at Tynecastle, was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo’s assistant at Rio Ave in 2012 and at Valencia.The pair met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course in 2009.“I am very excited about joining Wolves and looking forward to working with a coach and staff I know, trust and believe in,” said Cathro.“All of us share the same footballing philosophy and that is such an important factor for a successful coaching team.“Wolves is a fantastic club with a rich history and lots of potential, and I can’t wait to get started.”Cathro, who began his coaching career at Dundee United, has also been assistant boss at Newcastle and met the Wolves squad on Wednesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35efb001e13.jpg ","title":"fifty dogs join in fun at local hawaiian beach party","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAloha there!

It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35eff05a3fe-846x564.jpg ","title":"gulls are going nowhere bird expert says dundonians should learn to live with noisy neighbours","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEverywhere you look, our noisy urban neighbours are raking in bins – and even attacking unsuspecting pedestrians in a bid to steal their lunch.But according to one expert, the much-maligned gull is going nowhere in a hurry.Peter Rock, one of the leading authorities on urban gulls in Europe, said there is “no chance” that the gulls will return to less densely populated areas – regardless of any measures Dundee City Council puts in place to reduce their numbers.After studying the species for 38 years, Mr Rock dismissed claims the birds are congregating in the city to gorge on people’s rubbish.And he also said claims they are becoming more aggressive after feasting on human food are untrue.He said: “Despite the fact that so many people hate gulls, you’d be surprised to know how many people are actually feeding them.“Even if you stopped people feeding them, it’s going to make no difference – they are totally adept at finding food.“There are ways of curbing the problem, by removing eggs from nests. I’m sure the local council is aware of this and it would cost thousands of pounds.“This would need to be carried out for at least 10 years and even then, you wouldn’t visibly notice a big drop in the population.“I’m afraid to say you’ve got urban gulls and you’re not going to get rid of them. You may – with a great deal of expense – reduce the population slightly over time. But there is maybe a case to start embracing them.“Down at Bristol City Football Club, the team has celebrated the fact they share the city with their neighbours with a gull painted on one of the stands.”But some residents said many Dundee streets have such a problem with gulls they look like a scene from Jurassic Park.German Doner Kebab manager, Michael Dobson, 29, reckons the problem is largely man-made.He said: “I understand the council needs to look at other measures. There needs to be more awareness to stop feeding them. The residential bins are a nightmare – in the street you see gulls feasting on the rubbish.”Charlene Hutchison, 33, a supervisor at German Doner Kebab, said she is “terrified” to walk down Reform Street.She added: “If I’m on a day off I won’t walk down the street. My niece got attacked when she was only seven.”Heather Davidson, 40, from Broughty Ferry, said in her area the problem is just as bad.She said: “These birds are so big now it’s like a scene from Jurassic Park.”Taffy Barrington, 50, from the city centre, said the gull’s had become “fearless”. He said: “A couple of Saturdays ago I actually saw gulls scrapping over a pizza.“They are completely fearless of cars as well now.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We know that gulls can often be a cause for considerable distress and annoyance and we continually pursue tried and tested as well as innovative solutions to the problems that arise from these birds.“We are proactive in improving the waste disposal facilities in and around the city centre. Bins have been provided in many areas where previously waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Routine monitoring of this situation ensures that problem areas are swiftly identified to enable further action to be taken. We would also ask that people do not feed seagulls as this exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35ef77343e9-375x564.jpg ","title":"its the penguin parade colourful trail goes live across dundee and tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPenguins are popping up across Dundee and Tayside as part of a much-anticipated charity trail.And now, all 80 giant fibreglass birds which make up the Maggie’s Penguin Parade are in place.The colourfully decorated penguin sculptures will be displayed in the city and beyond over the summer, with families being challenged to locate them all.Each 5ft bird has been uniquely designed in aid of cancer charity Maggie’s, by artists who have taken inspiration from topics including footballers and the history of Dundee.The penguin parade is a partnership event between Maggie’s Dundee and Wild in Art.Maggie’s Dundee fundraising manager Annie Long said: “It’s wonderful to have our penguins in place and ready to be enjoyed by people from across the Dundee area and hopefully far beyond.”Famous names such as Judy Murray, Simple Minds and Lorraine Kelly have been involved in designing or sponsoring a penguin.Artist Tom Harris-Ward customised his penguin, located at Verdant Works, by adding a piece of wood from the RRS Discovery.Abertay University students have also been involved in the initiative after collaborating with Maggie’s to develop an app for the “Maggie and Fleur” penguin positioned outside Abertay University Library.Director of Wild in Art, Charlie Langhorne, said: “Maggie’s Penguin Parade is a celebration of creativity and of Dundee.The whole Maggie’s team is to be congratulated on such a fantastic spectacle that will bring a smile to the many thousands of people who will come and enjoy the trail.Now ‘waddle on’ and do the Penguin Parade.”More than 70,000 people took part in the city’s previous trail featuring Oor Wullie, in aid of the Archie Foundation.Funds from the penguin parade will help towards the cost of running the Maggie’s centre based at Ninewells.

Autistic Pride Day brought families and friends together for a picnic in Bellfield Park.Chairwoman of the group, Kabie Brook, wanted to thank everyone for coming along.\"Autistic Pride Day was rather special this year because at ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco who provided craft materials, Ashers bakery who provided a celebration cake and Strathspey Railway who donated a family ticket for the quiz prize.Special speakers

care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or

similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted.

He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate.

I’m not going to leave anything.“With the budget we’re going to try to spend it and get the best level of players in.”Despite already landing three midfielders in the window McInnes had remained keen to sign Hibs’ Scotland international McGeouch.However, sources indicate Sunderland are confident of bagging McGeouch before they leave for their training camp in Portugal early next week.The 25-year-old travelled to the Stadium of Light for talks last week and the Black Cats are confident of pushing a deal through.It is understood McGeouch is keen on a move south of the border.Rangers, Fulham, QPR, Blackburn and Coventry City were also keen on securing the midfielder.Aberdeen signings Forrester, Gleeson and Ferguson were today set to make their debuts against Cobh Ramblers.Centre-back Mikey Devlin, who signed for the Reds in January, is also set to make his long-awaited debut.Defender Devlin has been ruled out for more than a year having suffered cruciate ligament damage in May 2017.The friendly will be played at the Reds’ Fota Island Resort training complex on the outskirts of Cork, Republic of Ireland.It is the first step in a series of friendlies that will culminate in a clash with West Brom on July 20 before the Battle of Britain with Burnley.McInnes said: “When we were drawn against Siroki Brijeg in the second qualifying round last year I felt we were undercooked a bit.“So this year, even before we drew Burnley, we decided to get more games in.“Now we know we’re playing against a team from the English Premier League, those extra matches are a necessity.”Aberdeen have exited at the third qualifying round stage of the Europa League in four straight seasons. They lost out to Real Sociedad (Spain, 2014), Kairat Almaty (Kazakhstan, 2015), Maribor (Slovenia, 2016) and Apollon Limassol (Cyprus, 2018).Burnley boss Sean Dyche has admitted the Premier League, not Europe, will be the main focus for the Turf Moor side next season.European football could have an impact on the domestic campaign for the Clarets who finished seventh in the top flight.However, the previous season they finished fifth bottom of the table in their first campaign back.McInnes reckons there is no way Burnley will take Europe lightly after a 51-year absence from continental competition.He said: “Burnley have waited more than 50 years to play European football again. Now that they are back in I am sure they will feel an obligation and that excitement about it.“It is a competition I wouldn’t imagine Burnley will take lightly.“The Europa League is a competition a lot of English teams think they can do well in as Manchester United won it in 2017 and Arsenal reached the semis this year.“Burnley are a team that have done fantastically well in recent seasons.“For them to finish just outside that big top six in the English Premier League is a fantastic effort.“They will be excited for the European adventure.“Facing an English Premier League team is as tough a game as we could have at this stage.“Burnley were the stand-out team in our pot during the draw and the most difficult one.”European football normally means overseas scouting missions for the Dons to get the lowdown on their opponent.That will not be needed this time although the Reds could yet have someone travel back across to Ireland next week as Burnley face Cork City in a friendly on Friday.Mcinnes said: “Rather than talking about some obscure team and trying to say how good they are we are well aware of the strength of Burnley.“It is different from our European experience of recent years but there is still that excitement nevertheless.“We are very proud that we have qualified for Europe for five years in a row and we want to do well.“It is clear we have a really tough task ahead of us but one we will be ready for.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"46k boost gets show on road for good cause","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA stage school and charity is celebrating after receiving nearly £50,000 in a national funding scheme.Music 4 U was one of five groups in the North Scotland category that reached the final of the People’s Project 2018.The charity, which offers artistic opportunities to young people aged between 16 and 25, has walked away with £46,465.The People’s Project, which is in its 13th year, is run by the Big Lottery Fund along with The National Lottery, STV and ITV.Music 4 U now has the funding in place to start its Music 4 Communities project which will take performances to people who may otherwise struggle to see live stage shows.Debbie Kirkness, founder and director of Music 4 U, said: “We’ve been a charity since 2005 and it has only really been in the last 18 months that people have been finding out about us and what we do.“Getting the funding for our Music 4 Communities project means everything to us.“We will be able to stage showcases with young people and we support people from all walks of life including with learning and physical disabilities.“We will then be able to take our showcases to communities that might not be able to go to live performances or would struggle to visit somewhere like a theatre.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern. Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable and a crash that would be likely to cause only minor damage to a car could easily claim their life. A\u0026ampB is home to many country roads enjoyed by bikers, so road safety is clearly a key issue for our team.\u0026#8217Anyone interested in learning more about the Scottish Biker Down or would like to book one of the courses can email adam.barclay@firescotland.gov.uk to book your place on the course or visit our Facebook page ‘Biker Down Scotland’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays formal tribute to islays ww100 group","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 2:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council has formally recognised Islay’s ambitious programme of events commemorating two World War One tragedies off the coast of the island.Council members thanked Islay\u0026#8217s WW100 committee for providing an inspirational programme of events to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of SS Tuscania and the collision of HMS Otranto, which took place off the shores of Islay during the Great War.At a meeting of the full council this week members paid tribute to the group for their part in organising the national remembrance events, honouring those who lost their lives in the incidents, and providing a lasting legacy for the local community.Provost of Argyll and Bute, Len Scoullar said: \u0026#8216The WW100 group both national and local must be congratulated for arranging such a well-organised series of events to honour and pay respect to those who lost their lives in these tragedies, and commemorate the people of Islay who were involved in the response to the incidents.\u0026#8216The island really came together, engaging young and old, showcasing resilience, compassion and kindness.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

He motored along his home street of Sycamore Crescent, Forehill, and Hillfoot Road before being caught by officers. A booze reading revealed that he had 119 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 22. The 50-year-old was banned from the road for 24 months at Ayr Sheriff Court last week. He must also undergo community supervision for 18 months. Depute fiscal Jason Bell sought to forfeit the vehicle but Sheriff Leslie refused.  The court heard Murdoch accepted he has a drink problem and was referred for counselling,  Sheriff Desmond Leslie said the circumstances of the offence “point to much more concerning abuse.”  "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"first milk vending machine rolls","story":"NewsFirst milk vending machine rolls out in AyrshireIt is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:52, 22 JUN 2018NewsAlison and Willie Kerr with kids Joanne and David (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first milk vending machine in Ayrshire is pouring out pints fresh from the herd. It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"youngsters-make-a-splash-at-braw-lads-swimming-gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716326073,16323973,16325711,16325701,16325156\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross. This twisting, single-track mountain road is the third highest road in Scotland rising up to 626 metres (2,054 ft) above the sea level. It\u0026rsquos one of the most scenic rides in the world, very similar to the great mountain passes in the Alps, with very tight hairpin bends which switch back and forth up the hillside, with gradients approaching 20 percent.\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest highlight however, and by far the most humbling, has been the generosity of people from far and wide.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew that setting a \u0026pound25,000 fundraising target was ambitious, however we never imagined we would get so close to it, with funds currently around \u0026pound21,000.\n\u0026ldquoEqually the generosity of people along the way and the support they afforded us was incredible.\n\u0026ldquoOn our last day whilst cycling down the A9 towards Inverness we were flagged down as we passed a layby by the owner of the Golspie fish and chip shop with 10 chip suppers to fuel us on our last 50 miles.\nTo donate, go to: https://bit.ly/2y4NauJ\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-galashiels-braw-lads-gathering-2018-highlights-wednesday-night","story":"MISSED any of the action from the festivities for the 2018 Galashiels Braw Lads Gathering?\nWatch our coverage of the events across the town on Wednesday evening (June 27) below...\nDon\u0027t forget to buy next week\u0027s Border  newspaper for photos and\u0026nbspfull reports\n"},{"url":null,"title":"post-office-launches-six-week-consultation-on-new-innerleithen-branch","story":"POST Office bosses have launched a six-week consultation on the new Innerleithen branch.\nThe move follows a confirmation of opening times for customers when the concession opens within The Allotment grocery store on Innerleithen High Street on Wednesday, August 29.\nUpon opening, the branch will open from 10am to 5pm between Monday to Friday, and from 9.30am to 1pm on Saturday.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week. A trail of arrows around the town is also planned and will link in with a Global Treasure App, a treasure trail organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-first-reverse-vending-machine-is-at-musselburgh-iceland","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS Iceland store has become the first supermarket in Scotland to introduce a reverse vending machine in a bid to end plastic pollution.  These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"future-of-the-hollies-day-centre-safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun as Harry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

Stephen Gellaitry, 61, a modern language teacher, is calling it a day to travel the world after 35 years in the classroom.  Mrs Cavers is principal guidance teacher with Moray house and Mr Gellaitry is principal guidance teacher at Grange house.  The pair were honoured at a celebratory lunch in the school which was attended by colleagues.  In his speech, headteacher Colin Gerrie thanked both for their \u0026ldquolong and committed service to the school and wished them every happiness in their retirement.  Mrs Cavers, who is originally from Kirkcudbright but now lives in East Lothian, said that her 39 years at Musselburgh Grammar were a great example to pupils of \u0026ldquosticking in at school.  She is planning to travel and spend more time in her garden.  Mr Gellaitry, from Edinburgh, added: \u0026ldquoHaving taught at least two generations at Musselburgh, I feel that it is time to move on.

About 200 entries were judged by Paralympic star Maria Lyle Celia Hodson, founder of Hey Girls Callum Mark, general manager at Foxlake Adventures Provost John McMillan and Councillor Shamin Akhtar, spokesperson for education and children\u0026rsquos services.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"              SCOTTISH Ministers are to be urged to refuse planning permission for an electrical substation on the former Cockenzie Power Station site because it could prejudice future development there.  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS \u0026lsquoglory days\u0026rsquo in the history of golf are shared with visitors to the town\u0026rsquos museum this summer.  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8002885.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"brydon-expects-british-comedy-swimming-with-men-to-make-big-splash","story":"              Rob Brydon has told how he immediately fell in love with the script for new British comedy Swimming With Men \u0026ndash as the film closed out this year\u0026rsquos Edinburgh International Film Festival.  The comedian was one of a host of stars \u0026ndash including Jane Horrocks, Charlotte Riley, Daniel Mays, Rupert Graves, Nathaniel Parker and Thomas Turgoose \u0026ndash who took to the red carpet in the Scottish capital for the movie\u0026rsquos UK premiere.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos fantastic to be the closing film, it\u0026rsquos quite an honour, very prestigious, said Brydon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a city that I love. I\u0026rsquove been to Edinburgh so many times over the years, I\u0026rsquove performed here loads, so I was thrilled when I heard the news.  The bittersweet drama, likened to The Full Monty by some, features Brydon as a middle-aged man who comes across an unusual way to try and deal with issues in his marriage.  He plays Eric, an accountant who thinks his wife is having an affair.  He finds some solace at the local swimming pool, where he joins a male synchronised swimming team and \u0026ndash against all odds \u0026ndash they end up training for the world championships in Milan.  Brydon told Press Association Scotland: \u0026ldquoI read the script and I fell in love with it straight away. It pulls you in \u0026hellip It\u0026rsquos a lovely film.  He went on: \u0026ldquoI do think it\u0026rsquos come at a time when a lot of men are perhaps wondering what their role is. It\u0026rsquos certainly not as clearly defined as it was. So I think it\u0026rsquos quite timely in that sense.  Riley, who takes on the role of their coach, Susan, said the top cast \u0026ndash and the chance to learn a new skill \u0026ndash drew her in to the project.  She said: \u0026ldquoI knew that all these wonderful actors were going to be part of it and it was too much of an amazing opportunity to turn down.  \u0026ldquoYou know what actors are like, they love an opportunity to learn a new skill, so I was like \u0026lsquobrilliant, I get to learn how to synchronise swim and work with all these guys, it\u0026rsquos going to be amazing\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThey are brilliantly kind, funny and witty men and we had such a good laugh making this film \u0026ndash even at 4am in the morning.  On the particular challenges of acting and filming for hours on end in a swimming pool, she said: \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove got to eat a lot because you\u0026rsquore in a pool all day and burning a lot of energy. And you had to get me out of the pool quite a few times because I just turned blue.  \u0026ldquoIt just makes filming slightly slower and slightly more difficult, working out the shots.  \u0026ldquoBut equally it makes people really efficient because, with crew and actors in the water, you\u0026rsquove got to get the shot right and you\u0026rsquove got to get it first or second time.  In-demand actor Mays said shooting the film was physically gruelling.  \u0026ldquoIt was sort of an unusual job to do in many respects, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe had two weeks\u0026rsquo intensive swim school at the London Aquatic Centre to whip us up into shape.  \u0026ldquoThe shoot was physically gruelling. It looks like a lot of fun on the screen but I don\u0026rsquot recommend 12 hours in a swimming pool \u0026ndash it plays havoc on your skin.  \u0026ldquoSeriously, they all gave us a pot of moisturising cream when we first started the job, you don\u0026rsquot normally get that.  Mays, known for his role as police officer Danny Waldron in Line Of Duty, said he was attracted to working on a comedy after a range of heavyweight roles recently.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt was a fantastic experience with an amazing ensemble of actors. I\u0026rsquove worked with Ollie, our director, before on Dad\u0026rsquos Army. I was just sold on the idea.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod come off the back of three really heavy dramas, so the prospect of doing a light comedy really appealed, actually.  \u0026ldquoI just jumped at it really, or rather, dived in!"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7956875.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"castlemilk-singing-sensation-gerry-cinnamon-announces-four-glasgow-gig-dates","story":"              CASTLEMILK singing sensation Gerry Cinnamon has announced four Glasgow gig dates.

On Thursday, Glasgow recorded its hottest day since records began as another sweltering day saw the temperature peak at 31.9C (89.4F).  The city beat Wednesday\u0026rsquos high of 31.3C (88.3F) in Aviemore in the Highlands, and came close to matching the hottest June day ever recorded in Scotland - 32.2C (89.9F) at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893.  As tens of thousands of music lovers flock to Glasgow for TRNSMT at Glasgow Green and Fiesta x Fold in Kelvingrove Park, revellers are being urged to stock up on sunscreen and water.  Temperatures in the city will dip slightly, but it will still be warm for the week ahead with plenty of sunshine and temperatures around the 25C mark.  The first hosepipe ban is likely to come into place in Northern Ireland this weekend.  Northern Ireland Water said demand is outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water.  Scottish Water said it is managing supplies across the country and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Only two localised areas in Scotland have been issued with advice to \u0026ldquouse water wisely - parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  Other parts of the UK have urged water consumers to take simple steps to reduce the amount they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell, but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.  \u0026ldquoI think, for now, temperatures have peaked and we are not expecting to see any records today.  \u0026ldquoWe will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.

Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles.  Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  ScotRail customers have seen massive disruption across the Glasgow network for three days now as the railway lines buckle in the hot weather, with many speed restriction in place for train drivers.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires, including one in Bathgate.  The heat has already claimed casualties.  The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasise enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple: please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days.  Parts of the Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.  A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.  Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.  The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7996889.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"trnsmt-2018-bar-prices-at-glasgow-festival-revealed","story":"              THE bar prices have been revealed for TRNSMT festival.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For more than 25 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

In 2017 a total of 12,994 Britons acquired the nationality of one of the 17 member states, highlighted in new findings.  This compares with 5,025 in 2016 and only 1,800 in 2015.  German citizenship was the most frequently sought after, with a sharp rise in cases from just 594 in 2015 to 7,493 in 2017 for Germany.  The dramatic increase is thought to be caused by eligible UK citizens who can meet the criteria seeking to keep their legal rights attached to EU membership, and the 2017 figure is about seven times the 2015 level.  France was the second most popular nationality, jumping from 320 instances in 2015 to 1,518 last year.  Belgium was in third place and saw an increase from 127 to 1,381.  The number for Ireland rose from 54 in 2015 to 529 in 2017.  However, that did not include new Irish passport applications from a much larger number of people who already had entitlement to Irish citizenship, due to being born in Northern Ireland.  The findings do not show individuals leaving the UK for other EU nations, but show that an increasing amount of people with European family links are taking up dual citizenship to enjoy the rights of EU citizenship before Brexit in March 2019.  Those with new nationalities will retain the right to travel, live and work throughout the EU after the UK\u0027s departure, and may be able to pass these on to their children.  In most cases those involved have also retained their British citizenship and so have become dual nationals.  The surge in Britons obtaining EU citizenship was revealed in data obtained by the BBC from 17 out of 27 member states.  Only a limited number of UK citizens would qualify for citizenship of another EU state.  The increase was revealed amid reports of bitter cabinet splits over the future shape of Brexit.  Arch Brexiteer Michael Gove is said to have physically ripped up a report on Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s preferred option for a new customs partnership with the EU.  Gove was reported to have been \"livid\" as he felt the government document wrongly suggested his Brexit working group had agreed the plan was viable.  The Tory environment secretary\u0027s spokesman said he felt it downplayed his objections to the proposed customs relationship.  The Government has talked publicly about two potential options for its customs relationship with the EU after Brexit.  One, a customs partnership, would mean the UK applies the EU\u0027s own tariffs and rules of origin to all goods arriving in the country, intended for the EU.  The other, known as maximum facilitation or max-fac, aims to employ new technology to remove the need for physical customs checks where possible.  Two groups of cabinet members were looking at each of the plans.  The document in question, prepared by civil servants, was supposed to represent the views of a group of Cabinet members looking at the customs partnership, including Gove.  Gove was reported to have \"physically ripped it up to show he wasn\u0027t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions\".  Meanwhile, in a separate row, top diplomatic sources claimed Donald Trump said that the EU, Nato and the World Trade Organisation are bad for the US.  European Council president Donald Tusk told EU leaders that Trump posed a serious threat to western unity and it would be a mistake to dismiss the American President as stupid.  \u0026ldquoHe has a method and is serious in his mission against an international rules-based order, Tusk told the leaders, according to a senior diplomatic source.  \u0026ldquoHe is on a mission against what we stand for.  The dramatic developments came as Austria took over the rotating presidency of the EU with a pledge to better secure the 28-nation bloc\u0026rsquos external borders."},{"url":null,"title":"salmond-insists-the-vow-did-swing-indyref-result","story":"              ALEX Salmond has challenged a claim that the pledge of new powers for Scotland in the closing stages of the 2014 independence referendum did not clinch victory for the No campaign.  The Vow, signed by the then Prime Minister David Cameron, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband, appeared on the front page of the Daily Record two days ahead of the historic vote  However, the then Daily Record editor Murray Foote, says his motivation for publishing the pledge was to ensure the politicians kept to their word.  He added there was no evidence it lost the campaign for Yes which he believed failed because the economic case for independence was not strong enough.  Salmond hailed Foote, who stood down as editor of the Record in March, as \u0026ldquoa new recruit to the independence cause.  Foote came out in support of an independent Scotland this month.  However, Salmond said he disagreed with Foote about the impact of The Vow.  Salmond said: \"I warmly welcome Murray Foote as a new recruit to the independence cause but he heavily underrates the significance of the Vow which was a journalistic masterpiece but politically disabled Scotland at a crucial moment.  \u0026ldquoIt presented a No campaign then in total disarray with a rallying point in the final week of the 2014 referendum.  \u0026ldquoThe Daily Record provided an infinitely more credible vehicle than George Osborne and the Tory Government who first wanted to proffer the panicked promise of more powers."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-rocking-as-music-festivals-take-weekend-by-storm","story":"              SCOTLAND was rocking this weekend as music festivals kicked off in both Glasgow and Dumfries, including the high profile TRNSMT at Glasgow Green.

The sands around Scotland are host to a huge and increasing range of leisure pursuits and beach cultures. From espresso-drinking to stone stacking, here\u0027s our guide to how Scots are entertaining themselves during these long, hot days at the seaside.  Sandcastle building  Some seaside cultures come and go, but one activity that\u0026rsquos always to be found on a sandy beach is sandcastle building. Parents pass it on to their children. Kids just seem to have an instinct for doing it anyway. No one is really sure when, back in the mists of time, the first sand castle was built. But we can say castles have been built on Scottish beaches for decades. A Fife Herald article from 1856 declares: \"Let him bathe and puddle in the water - let him build sand castles on the beach. Of course, we can fancy it up. We can hold competitions, like the one that will take place at the Crail festival on July 28. We can call it \u0026ldquosand art. We can try to build the biggest one ever \u0026ndash the world record is held by a 16.84 metre high construction, built in Duisburg, Germany. But proper sand castle building isn\u0026rsquot about all that. It\u0026rsquos simple play \u0026ndash messing about in the mud.  Stone stacking  Is this the new sandcastle building? Or a strange new cult that is overtaking our beaches? The last year has seen these mysterious mini towers of rock increasingly colonise shores up and down the country. Mostly that\u0026rsquos due to the passion of one man, James Craig Page. Last year the artist set up the European Stone Stacking Championships in Dunbar, and the craft has spread like loom bands and fidget spinners since. You can barely throw a stone these days on a beach without it knocking into some piece of quarzite precariously balanced on top of an old fossil. \"It\u0026rsquos like a creative meditation, Craig Page says. \u0026ldquoAs soon as you start to practice this and engage in it, you go into this very meditative state and you don\u0026rsquot think about the future \u0026ndash you\u0026rsquore just totally in the moment. He has even started doing workshops with children in schools. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been remarkable. A lot of the children that are least attentive in the class, that have been labelled with ADHD seem to get it. My dream is to get this into the national curriculum in Scotland and across Britain.  Paddleboarding  The rise and rise of paddle boarding can be witnessed around the coast of Scotland. This is the mellow water sport, for those who don\u0026rsquot want to get salt up their nose or serious windburn. It\u0026rsquos also possible to do paddleboarding while striking a downward dog or some other yoga positions. In fact, stand up paddle board yoga is a thing. Yoga guru Michaella Robb runs classes in it on the Dundee waterfront. But, if you\u0026rsquore braving the choppy waters of the sea, just standing up might be enough of a challenge.  Beach cleaning  The sea is full of plastic. The beach is a tip \u0026ndash litter on Scottish beaches rose by six per cent last year. Of course, we can spend our time moaning about it while we lie on our beach mat sipping from a plastic bottle, but it\u0026rsquos also possible to do something \u0026ndash and many are. Beach cleaning is, very nearly, a form of beach leisure activity, and most who do it find fun as well as virtuous. Surfers Against Sewage earlier this year organised the Big Spring Beach Clean which resulted in volunteers around the UK removing 64,000 tonnes of marine plastic pollution from our coastlines. Marine Conservation Society Scotland coordinates regular beach cleans. Catherine Gemmell, the young campaigner who plans them, says interest in ocean plastics has \"skyrocketed\" in the past few years. \"This September we are running our 25th Great British Beach Clean \u0026ndash can we make it the biggest one yet?\" Gemmell observes that beach cleans are often surprisingly competitive. \"The friendly competition sets in pretty quickly, from who found the most, the heaviest, the weirdest or the smallest items.\"  Hut posing  Sitting in front of your \u0026pound25,000 beach hut \u0026ndash the reported price of, for instance, huts in Findhorn Bay - is a very nice activity for those who have the wherewithal to indulge in it. If, as it happens, you don\u0026rsquot, one alternative is to set your deckchair, or some other fancy-looking beach prop, up in front of someone else\u0026rsquos hut, which does not appear to be in use for the day. That said Scottish beach huts are really a snip by comparison with those you get in some parts of England, where you can pay up to \u0026pound295,000 for a hut in Dorset with no electricity or running water, but enough room to sleep six.  Lying down on the sand and doing nothing  One of the most popular and enduring of beach pursuits. This can, of course, be done on a beach towel, or scratchy rug, but, for full luxury, it\u0026rsquos necessary to get out that sun-lounger \u0026ndash begged, borrowed or stolen \u0026ndash that hasn\u0026rsquot seen the light of day since the hottest day of 2017 and lug it all the way down to the sand. By the time you\u0026rsquove got there you\u0026rsquoll be dripping sweat all you\u0026rsquoll want to do is collapse there for the next few hours \u0026ndash preferably with a cold beer. You will also need a nice book, to use as a nose shade once you\u0026rsquove read a sentence or two.  Beach barbecuing  A beach outing is incomplete without the smell of smoke and the sizzle of sausages over charcoal. Because, of course, though it\u0026rsquos hot, for us Scots it is clearly is not hot enough. A beach day requires at least some sauna-style sweating over a grill. Given this, once the sun is out, the rush is on. If you\u0026rsquove not got a barbecue yet, you may need to brawl your way out of the shop with the last one. But which one? The gas barbie? The charcoal bucket? Or one of those trendy, schmancy Lotus Grills? The choice can be paralysing. One thing however is clear \u0026ndash which one you shouldn\u0026rsquot get. That would be the disposable barbie that just creates waste and is also a hazard on the beach, if left there \u0026ndash and has, as news stories testify, accounted for more than a few child foot burns.  Taps aff  There is a difference between sunbathing and taps aff. The former involves sensible amounts of sun cream, a relaxed attitude and some relatively sober lounging. The latter is all about a disregard for all decorum and a sticking two fingers up to body fascism, as well as the nanny state who would have you protect yourself from skin cancer. Taps aff can also be done while there is not really enough sun for sun bathing. While it can be done on the beach, it\u0026rsquos not strictly a beach activity, and actually has much greater impact when done on the high street or outside a pub. On a sizzling day, taps aff is like saying to the sun, \u0026ldquoOy, you up there, pal! Aye, you, sun. I can take you.  Surfing  We have, in Scotland, some of the best surfing beaches in Europe. The only problem is they\u0026rsquore at their best in the colder months, from September through to May, when the sea is glacial. But still, you can catch a good wave in Scotland, even in the summer. Thurso may be where people go for World Class surfing, but a surf scene is developing in many other parts, from Pease Bay to the beaches of Tiree or Islay. As Iona Larg, who runs Blackmountain Watersports on Tiree points out, there\u0026rsquos a nice family surf culture developing on the island. Youngsters are growing up learning to surf at their \u0026ldquowee surf club, families are coming for their holidays \u0026ndash her son, Ben, is even a champion surfer. \u0026ldquoIn some other places like Bali, she says, \u0026ldquosurfing is ultra-cool. It\u0026rsquos the beautiful people. But here in Scotland you\u0026rsquove got to wear a 5mm wetsuit and it can be Baltic, so it\u0026rsquos not about that. The result is the culture is super inclusive and we\u0026rsquore always happy to see other people.  Wild swimming  There\u0026rsquos been a lot of talk about \u0026ldquowild swimming in recent years \u0026ndash in Scotland, virtually, any swimming in the sea, or even paddling above thigh-level, is what most would call wild. Scots have become so spoilt by their Mediterranean holidays that it\u0026rsquos now hard to imagine our idea of fun might have been a dip in one of those now crumbled tidal swimming pools that dot the coast. But proper warm, swimming days do come, and we\u0026rsquove had some of them recently. In any case, when they are not here, there are always hardcore wild swimmers who are willing to take on the chill, come sun or snow, like the Wild Ones, a group dedicated to sea swimming in Portobello.  Beach baristas and feral foodies  Wherever you go in today\u0026rsquos world, you\u0026rsquore rarely more than a short walk away from a cup of artisan coffee \u0026ndash even when you\u0026rsquore on a beach. It used to be you would be lucky if your favourite beach was honoured by a visit from a Mr Whippy selling van \u0026ndash even luckier if it had blood sauce. But these days, beaches are turning into foodie and coffee paradises. If your local beach hasn\u0026rsquot got a trendy new beach caf\u0026eacute \u0026ndash like the in an old at Cramond \u0026ndash or shack, then it had better be served regularly by some sort of gourmet-mobile. Vans like the Little Green Van, often stationed at Portobello, Chantilly Bleu in Elie, and Coffee at the Kings on Cullen beach, are supplying those of us who can\u0026rsquot go anywhere without craving a mellow roast. Meanwhile, foodie heaven is to be found by the sands, when vans like The Cheesy Toast Shack (at Kingsbarns, Fife) pull up. The flask of instant is dead. The world is one big coffee shop.  Beachspotting  Your guide to human beach life and the habitats in which it is found  Elie  This picturesque Fife fishing village is where puff-breasted Edinburgh New Towners and other wealthy city birds migrate in the sunny months, and can be found paddleboarding and eating delicious crepes and pizzas from Chantilly Bleu, a blue van parked by the breakwater. Poorer holidaymakers may visit, but Elie is more the natural habitat of the rich. Next door to the Earlsferry Links golf club is the most expensive street outside the top three cities, in Scotland.  Dunbar  In commuting distance of the capital, you may be lucky enough to spot the crested stone stacker, or possibly evidence of their presence in the form of towering constructions of pebbles dotted along the shoreline. Mostly artists, and other creative types. This species is now increasingly to be found on many other beaches across Scotland.  Troon  One of the most phenomenal beach migrations is that of the Buckfast Teen to this Ayrshire beach during particularly hot days. They arrive in their hordes on trains bringing beer and other alcoholic beverages, leading to scenes of drunkenness and chaos. Mainly these are youngsters, teenagers and young adults, and crowds can reach as many as 1,500. This is somewhat of a regular feature that the police are used to \u0026ndash happening several times a year depending on the weather patterns \u0026ndash and has earned Troon the nickname \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos Magaluf. Luckily, for these migrators, Troon is much closer than Magaluf.  Sands Of Morar  The Digital detoxer is often to be found during summer holidays on this uncrowded beach, perched over a pile of gathered sticks trying to light a fire with a flint, while berating themselves for not having charged their phone, and mourning the fact that there will be no picture of this serene scene to post on Facebook.  Thurso East  That magnificent beast, the Surfcatcher is sometimes to be spotted among the huge breakers that crash onto the shore at Thurso East. They are drawn here by its reputation as one of the best, but coldest, surf spots in Europe. Also to be found at Pease Bay and on Tiree and Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"dup-leaders-calls-for-northern-ireland-scotland-bridge-dismissed-by-scots-political-parties-after-orange-walk-event","story":"              SCOTS political parties have dismissed calls made by DUP leader Arlene Foster at an Orange Walk in Cowdenbeath yesterday for a bridge to be built between Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Speaking to the Sunday Herald before giving a speech ahead of yesterday\u0026rsquos march, Foster said she wanted to see a bridge built between Northern Ireland and Scotland to boost the economies in both places post-Brexit.  She admitted the bridge she envisioned had not been costed, but insisted she was \u0026ldquoserious about it. The DUP leader added that she was \u0026ldquonot like Trump and didn\u0026rsquot expect others to pay for it.  However, in response, the SNP and Scottish Labour urged Foster to focus on rebuilding the power sharing agreement in Northern Ireland, which collapsed last year.  An SNP spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWith the Northern Ireland Assembly suspended, Arlene Foster\u0026rsquos priority should be getting Stormont back up and running.  A Scottish Labour spokesman added: \u0026ldquoGiven the shambles her Tory allies are making of Brexit, not to mention the lack of leadership at Stormont, Arlene Foster would do better to focus on more pressing issues.  During her speech, Foster said she hoped to be able to drive to Scotland in future, and asked the Orange Order to get behind a campaign for a road link.  \u0026ldquoAmongst all the nasty and abusive comments made about the Orange wouldn\u0026rsquot it be great to become an actual bridge builder between Northern Ireland and Scotland? she said.  When asked how the bridge would be paid for, Foster told the Sunday Herald: \u0026ldquoWell, I\u0026rsquom not like Trump. I\u0026rsquom not saying we\u0026rsquoll build a bridge and you\u0026rsquoll pay for it. I think we\u0026rsquoll find ways to do it.  A spokesman for the DUP later told this newspaper that they would expect \u0026lsquoa contribution\u0026rsquo from the UK Government.  Standing in the local high school grounds, Foster went on to give the crowd a history lesson on William of Orange, insisting there is a \u0026ldquolack of appreciation about his life.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe need to be like William and build alliances for the good of all the country. This country needs to be a shared place where people are able to live free from intolerance and hatred. Such bigotry was not part of King William\u0026rsquos mind-set and it should not be part of ours.  However, politicians in Scotland took aim at the record of the DUP \u0026ndash which opposes same-sex marriage \u0026ndash on equality issues.  Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell, who represents the Mid Scotland and Fife region at the Scottish Parliament, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a shame Ms Foster didn\u0026rsquot choose to visit at the beginning of July when she could have enjoyed a far more colourful procession at Fife Pride.  CLOSED DOORS AND GRAFFITI WARS: HOW COWDENBEATH LOCALS RESPONDED TO THE ORANGE ORDER AND ARLENE FOSTER  THERE were as many people leaving Cowdenbeath yesterday as were arriving for the Orange Walk.  As coach loads of people rolled in, cars full of families drove in the opposite direction before the main road out of the town was closed by police.  One father of two, who asked not to be named, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom taking the kids away for the day. I don\u0026rsquot want them to see this.  A homeowner who lives near the school also said he would be leaving town for the day but he asked not to be named. \u0026ldquoI won\u0026rsquot be back until tonight, he said.  Outside his house was freshly daubed graffiti which read: \u0026ldquoF**k the DUP, \u0026ldquoOrange b******s, and \u0026ldquoIRA.  Many people who had arrived in Cowdenbeath took pictures of the graffiti and shook their heads.  One said: \u0026ldquoThe police should do something about this. Someone must have seen something.  Another added: \u0026ldquoI see the Taigs have been busy. Taigs is a derogatory term for a Catholic or Irish nationalist.  When the Sunday Herald told Arlene Foster about the graffiti, she said: \u0026lsquoThat is very sad. People should be allowed to celebrate their culture and heritage ... there is nothing here that should offend anybody.\u0026rsquo  Ahead of the event, business owners spoke of their concerns that it could affect trade.  The town\u0026rsquos optometrist cancelled a clinic when every appointment was rescheduled by customers.  Natalie McHale, who is the manager of Ferrier and Mackinnon Optometrists, said: \u0026ldquoThe minute it starts the shutters are going down.  Another business owner, who asked not to be named, said she would also shut up shop.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos scandalous, she said. \u0026ldquoMy view has nothing to do with religion - I\u0026rsquom a Protestant and I married a Catholic - this is about businesses struggling to survive. This event is another nail in the coffin for this high street.  \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot even give you my name because I can\u0026rsquot afford to lose any more customers.  Another local business owner, who also asked not to be named because he is afraid he\u0026rsquoll lose customers, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a nightmare. I\u0026rsquom trying to arrange delivery of stock but the drivers are refusing to come near Cowdenbeath because all the roads are closed.  However, Ruby Ramsay, who runs Bits and Bobs, was more pragmatic. She said: \u0026ldquoWe need a turn in Cowdenbeath and I\u0026rsquom hoping this event will give us that. It\u0026rsquos not the right kind of business but we\u0026rsquoll take it.  Newly elected chairwoman of local charity Fife Migrants Forum, Violeta Ilendo, said she had \u0026ldquodeep concerns about the Orange walk visit: \u0026ldquoMigrant communities in Fife feel disappointed that the permission was granted for the march. It is adding pressure to the public spend. Public money would be better spent on community integration and cohesion.  More than 100 police officers were reported to have been drafted in to oversee the Orange Walk.  A spokeswoman for Fife Council defended the decision to allow the Orange Order to use school property as part of its events, saying: \u0026ldquoThe council has no right to say who is or isn\u0026rsquot allowed to hold an event."},{"url":null,"title":"stephen-house-made-120000-consultancy-bid-from-snp-government-weeks-after-resigning","story":"              A FORMER Police Scotland chief constable pitched for \u0026pound120,000 of consultancy work from the Scottish Government weeks after announcing his resignation.  Sarantium Solutions, owned by Sir Stephen House, made the funding bid to provide six months of counter terrorism advice, but the Government declined to pursue the opportunity.  Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur said: \"Bearing in mind the circumstances of Stephen House\u0027s resignation, it is extraordinary to learn that the Scottish Government was even considering his returning to the scene in the form of consultancy work just months later.\"  House was chief constable of Strathclyde Police before taking the top job at the single force, but his time in post was marred by a host of policing scandals.  The Glasgow-born police chief was criticised after it emerged that beat officers were responding to routine incidents while carrying firearms.  He also faced sustained media, political and academic scrutiny over the decision to roll out Strathclyde\u0026rsquos industrial use of stop and search to the rest of Scotland.  Hundreds of thousands of searches were recorded in one year, but the figure was widely believed to be false as officers were registering bogus frisks in a desperate bid to meet targets.  House defended the policy, but it was eventually reformed out of all recognition and search rates tumbled.  He also felt strong political pressure after police failed to attend an M9 crash site for three days, an incident that had left two people dead.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the tragedy was her lowest moment in office and described the lengthy delay in responding to the call as a \u0026ldquodreadful failure.  House was also criticised over his force\u0026rsquos discredited Counter Corruption Unit after an illegal spying operation was launched to flush out the sources on a newspaper investigation.  Under pressure, House announced in autumn 2015 that he would be standing down later in the year. He then formed consultancy firm Sarantium Solutions.  Weeks after announcing his departure, the Scottish Government invited House to submit a proposal on the country\u0026rsquos readiness in relation to counter-terrorism.  In November 2015, House contacted senior civil servant Paul Johnston with his thoughts on an \u0026ldquoin depth analysis and review.  His pitch stated: \u0026ldquoThe opportunity exists to utilise this unique experience and expertise in a study that can now offer fresh thinking and \u0027think the unthinkable\u0027, unfettered by recent command responsibilities.  House also promised his work would contain a \u0026ldquospecial reference to the role of the Scottish Government - specifically the First Minister and Cabinet Member - in the event of a terrorist attack.  The cash bid concluded: \u0026ldquoSir Stephen brings unrivalled experience and expertise as well as an unbeatable network of international contacts to the study, combined with a deep knowledge of Scotland\u0026rsquos capabilities and needs.  Days later, House emailed the same civil servant with an updated proposal and wrote: \u0026ldquoYou will note that the price has gone up.  The first contract option was a \u0026ldquosingle block of six months work, which came in at \u0026pound120,000, while the cheaper alternative was a two-phase project worth \u0026pound110,000. The Government did not award the contract.  House was this year appointed as an assistant commissioner in the politan Police.  Scottish Tory MSP Liam Kerr said: \u0026ldquoGiven the cloud under which Sir Stephen House left, people would have expected the Scottish Government to cut ties altogether. Instead, ministers couldn\u0026rsquot wait to have him back in. It\u0026rsquos just a relief that his proposed rates were so unreasonable, even the SNP government couldn\u0026rsquot agree to them.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoSet against the backdrop of recent attacks in Europe throughout 2015, the Scottish Government considered undertaking some work on its readiness. As such, the Scottish Government invited Sir Stephen House, as outgoing chief constable of Police Scotland, to submit a project proposal. However, as has been stated \u0026hellip the need for these services did not arise, so a contract was not awarded and no payment was made.  House could not be reached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"union-calls-on-scottish-secretary-david-mundell-to-intervene-to-secure-jobs-at-bifab","story":"              SCOTTISH Secretary David Mundell is facing calls to intervene to safeguard jobs at the troubled BiFab engineering firm.  Unions have held talks with Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson at Holyrood about the business.  They want Davidson to use her influence with the UK Government to get ministers to step in to secure the jobs of BiFab workers at yards in Fife and Arnish.  Unions said in February that they had been told that 260 jobs were to go by the end of May, with the yards facing full closure a month later.  A takeover by a Canadian engineering firm was later brokered by the Scottish Government, which said the deal with JV Driver and DF Barnes would allow the yards to seek new fabrication and construction work in the marine, renewables and energy sectors.  However, the GMB union says the UK Government must also intervene in light of a new threat to jobs.  The union says no new work has been secured by the contractor, DF Barnes, and the remaining workforce would be cut again to just a small team handling basic maintenance.  GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith urged Mundell must use his role as Scottish Secretary to deliver a fresh rescue package, and said he should consider subsidies for the yards in Fife and Arnish, which have completed renewable energy projects such as the \u0026pound2.6 billion Beatrice Offshore Windfarm.  He said: \"We want to know what the UK Government is going to do to support manufacturing jobs in the sector and what pressure Ruth Davidson can put on her Tory colleagues at Westminster.  \"We are disappointed in the lack of support from David Mundell and hope that Ruth Davidson can get him to focus on what support could be available.  \"The renewables industry depends on subsidies.  \"We need this to focus on what support we can get for the manufacturing sector for firms like BiFab.\"  The union leader met Davidson at Holyrood last week for talks about the future of the BiFab.  Smith said Mundell has failed to take any significant action over the firm.  In response, a UK Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to supporting a thriving renewables sector and are investing more than \u0026pound2.5bn in low carbon innovation by 2021, helping deliver opportunities for companies such as BiFab and others in the supply chain.  \u0026ldquoIn the clean growth strategy we reaffirmed our support for offshore wind by working with industry as they develop an ambitious plan which could result in 10 gigawatts of new capacity in the 2020s.  \u0026ldquoWe are making up to \u0026pound557 million of annual support available for innovative offshore wind projects, providing industry with the certainty they need to invest in such schemes.  A Scottish Tory spokesman added: \u0026ldquoRuth Davidson met with BiFab this week and fully intends to help them in any way she can."},{"url":null,"title":"the-big-read-what-love-island-really-says-about-the-world-we-live-in","story":"              WELCOME to Paradise. Here the sun always shines, the men have six packs, the women have curves in all the right places and the only thing you need to worry about is how much grafting (to use the show\u0027s lingo) you have to put into attracting the opposite sex.  Unless you\u0027ve been living in deep freeze, it\u0027s hard to escape the cultural phenomenon that is the Bafta-winning, dating reality TV show, Love Island. It revolves around a dizzying array of \u0026ldquosexy singles who purport to be looking for true love, along with the \u0026pound50,000 prize money (or, let\u0027s be honest, a launch pad for a celeb career), and spend up to eight weeks in a luxury villa in Mallorca trying to convince audiences that they\u0027ve found the man, or woman, of their dreams. It\u0027s knowingly narrated for laughs by Scottish comedian Iain Stirling and hosted by reality TV veteran Caroline Flack.  Whether or not it\u0027s working out for contestants, Love Island\u0027s fourth series is certainly pulling in the audiences of ITV2\u0027s dreams. An average 2.9 million people tuned in for the launch episode on June 4, more than double that of the first episode in 2017. Last week it was the highest-rating TV show at 9pm, with audiences \u0026ndash more than half of whom are in the 16-34 age range (the holy grail of TV producers) \u0026ndash peaking at 3.4million viewers. It has an overall audience share of 16 percent, that rises to almost 50 percent of younger viewers, and a whole range of merch.  Even if it sounds closer to your version of hell than paradise, there is no denying its widespread influence. But it\u0027s only a daft game show, right? As with any mainstream hit there\u0027s been plenty of sneering, about those who watch as much as those on-screen. In some ways you can see why.  In a month in which Donald Trump\u0027s immigration policies at the US border saw toddlers ripped from their mothers\u0027 arms and children kept in cages, while others were bombed in Yemen, could we really feel justified in worrying about whether Wes Nelson would be best off sticking with 29-year-old air hostess Laura Anderson or cracking on with surgically enhanced Megan Barton-Hanson? As Brexit negotiations continued to hurtle towards the cliff-edge, dragging us all towards who-knows-what, was it really OK to stuff our fingers in our ears until 9pm when we could relax into wondering if increasingly uptight and awkward A\u0026ampE doctor Alex George would finally convince a girl to fancy him?  Dr Faye Woods, lecturer in film and television at Reading University, dismisses this either/or view. She points out that while audiences of this female-targeted series are met with derision, it\u0027s not just socially acceptable, but actively expected, that men will down tools to watch the World Cup.  \u0026ldquoThis is an event bringing the nation together that isn\u0026rsquot terrible men\u0026rsquos footie, she says. \u0026ldquoLove Island gives us that space to breathe and focus on something else, a little oasis of pleasure amidst our current darkness. We can hold multiple thoughts in our brain simultaneously, and refocusing for a while every night is healthy for our well-being.  Which seems fair enough. And who doesn\u0027t like watching beautiful people? There\u0027s a fascination not just in their symmetrical features and gym-fit bodies, but in the amount of effort that goes into grooming \u0026ndash the carefully layered tans and whitened teeth, shaved chests, perfectly arched brows and painted nails (which mostly happens off camera, as if by magic).  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a kind of vicarious pleasure, reckons Gladeana McMahon, a psychological adviser for reality shows such as the early Big Brother series, and the driving force behind the production of the \u0026ldquoEthical Guidelines for Reality TV produced by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u0026ldquoThis is the gladiatorial pit without the violence.  But as she points out, ITV2 has set out to get big audiences by going for a winning formula, that is, in many ways, nostalgic and safe. While it\u0027s supposedly all about glamour and sexual sizzle \u0026ndash once you\u0027re coupled up with someone you share a double bed in the dorm and see what you can get away with under the duvet \u0026ndash this dream seems in some ways weirdly old-fashioned.  In an age in which woke millennials are seemingly increasingly accepting of gender as a fluid rather than a binary concept, the stereotypes on display \u0026ndash where men talk about treating women like queens, being \u0026ldquogentlemen, and some of the girls play dumb to get the guy \u0026ndash pull progressive views up short.  It\u0027s all about the archetypes. Adam Collard \u0026ndash trading on Garden of Eden associations and looking for temptation \u0026ndash describes himself as tall, dark and handsome, with great abs. What more could anyone want, he wonders aloud? (A little bit of respect and common decency it turns out, but more of that later.)  As Nicola Bishop, a researcher in English and television at Manchester politan University, notes: \u0026ldquoThis is \u0026lsquopin-up\u0026rsquo TV with little diversity of body types. There is a lot of readable anxiety among the male competitors about measuring up against perceived physical ideals of masculinity.  The love on this heteronormative island is not for everyone. There are lots of reality TV shows that have been very positive about representing LGBT contestants \u0026ndash Brian Dowling, winner of Big Brother\u0027s second series, is testament to that. This isn\u0027t one of them. While last year\u0027s Love Island did include a short bisexual romance between two of the women, and host Caroline Flack hinted there may be gay contestants in the future, bosses are clear. It\u0027s a dating show for straight couples and everyone needs to fancy each other. They claim they wouldn\u0027t rule out a standalone show but none is forthcoming so far.  As versions of romance go, despite the bed-swapping, it\u0027s an interestingly traditional one. Several commentators have pointed out that with its claustrophobic sense of ennui, codified courting behaviour and double-crossing, the dream on offer has more than a whiff of Jane Austen about it all.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s the Diana story, it\u0027s Cinderella, adds McMahon. Considering the number of people getting married in the UK is at an all-time low, there\u0027s an awful lot of talk about it. Adam claims there\u0027s not a girl in the house that he wouldn\u0027t want as a wife, while Laura hints to 20-year-old Wes, after sharing a bed with him for a few weeks, that she\u0027s on the look-out for a husband.  While in the real world there might be an increasing acceptance of less traditional relationships, or even non-monogamous ones, what\u0027s on offer here is what writer and columnist Laurie Penny refers to as Love TM. This search for Mr or Mrs Right is what she calls \u0026ldquothe narrow romantic fantasy that trumps all other forms of love, which is put on a pedestal as the answer to all our life problems and insecurities and never questioned. As beautiful lawyer Rosie Williams, ditched by Adam, cries to the other girls \u0026ldquoI just want to be enough, you wish she already knew she was.  It is her experience too that shows the darker side of the fairytale \u0026ndash Hans Christian Andersen rather than Disney \u0026ndash with Women\u0027s Aid going as far as issuing a warning about spotting the signs of abuse in response to Adam\u0027s \u0026ldquogaslighting of her (a term used to describe psychological manipulation aimed at making someone question their version of reality). The charity said there were clear warning signs in Adam\u0027s behaviour of emotional abuse and called on viewers to speak out against unhealthy relationships.  Faye Woods claims that though it\u0027s \u0026ldquodistressing emotionally to watch this play out on television, it\u0027s been valuable \u0026ldquoin terms of understanding and awareness of everyday behaviour. She adds: \u0026ldquoI think of all the people who may have dismissed coercive control, but then saw it in practice with Adam and Rosie and then understood it.  Then there\u0027s the issue of race. From the off it was not lost on black women writers and commentators such as Danielle Dash who noticed the way the statuesquely beautiful Samira Mighty \u0026ndash the only black woman in the house \u0026ndash was over-looked by all the boys and ended up with Alex because he\u0027d been usurped in his first choice by another man. On Friday, with another cohort of boys arriving in the villa resolutely uninterested in her, she finally broke down claiming to be \u0026ldquoso confused.  On the outside there is less confusion as people fit the pieces together. There\u0027s the way the public \u0026ldquoforgot to vote for singer Alexandra Burke, who outdanced all her competitors week after week on Strictly Come Dancing and repeatedly ended up in the dance off, the black girls passed over in dating show Take Me Out, the racist incidents in Big Brother House\u0027s gone by. Reality TV, argue many, has form.  Dr Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, hasn\u0027t watched it but isn\u0027t surprised by the concerns. \u0026ldquoReality TV is popular because it resonates with people, he says. \u0026ldquoSo we shouldn\u0027t be surprised when it replicates the racism that we see in society. Actually television often shows a world that is artificially equal. It\u0027s very rare now that something like Midsomer Murders \u0026ndash showing an all-white world \u0026ndash will be commissioned. So we sometimes get a distorted view when in actual fact the country is really segregated. In reality TV we see the reality that society is dominated by ideas of white supremacy.  It\u0027s not just the way the characters interact \u0026ndash it\u0027s also the way it\u0027s cast and edited, he claims. \u0026ldquoIf you look at who made the show, who picked the characters, who commissioned it in the first place, you\u0027ll probably find that it reflects a bias, he adds. \u0026ldquoThey [producers] should be mindful of that, more responsible. But fixing Love Island isn\u0027t going to do anything. It\u0027s a symptom of the problem.  Though unlikely to start viewing now, he admits it\u0027s probably more important than some give it credit for. It\u0027s certainly important to the millions of fans, following contestants\u0027 Instagram accounts in their droves, live-tweeting their own social commentary, or dissecting it with their mates on group chat. On Twitter there\u0027s support for Samira, complaints about Adam and other men\u0027s behaviour towards the women, and of course the inevitable backlash, calling out double standards. Discussion around the \u0026ldquosexual shaming of the women, when contestants were asked to share the number of people they\u0027d slept with, was red hot. On screen Laura\u0027s 30 was initially met with embarrassed silence, while Adam\u0027s 200 with backslapping.  Yet writing in the Times earlier this month Caitlin Moran claimed it is that interaction that makes Love Island an unlikely vehicle for feminism \u0026ldquobecause we live in an era when every one of the classic tactics used by these men \u0026ndash gaslighting, denial, coercion, guilt \u0026ndash is met with a fabulous deconstruction on social media. For the first time we have live, rolling footage of total ledges trying the kind of mindf***y shenanigans that previously have happened in the privacy of bars or the back of cabs ... That smirk! If you see a man smirk like that, leave immediately by the nearest exit, for you are dealing with a human trash-fire.  Online chat is also about spotting who is genuine (ie the loveable Dani Dyer and her boyfriend, stationery salesman Jack Fincham, whose loyalty during separation had hearts melting) and who is faking it. Who is merely playing the game? It\u0027s a rolling audience commentary that underlines the fact that just being young doesn\u0027t make you dumb.  As Faye Woods says: \u0026ldquoReality TV is never real, and all viewers know this. It is non-viewers who attempt to dismiss them as gullible. Reality TV is built for savvy, sophisticated viewers, who are able to pivot effortlessly between awareness of this as constructed process and an emotional immersion.  Paradise, then, might be a great way to switch off. But, it turns out, Paradise deconstructed might have plenty to tell us about our society and youth culture today, as long as we\u0027re ready to listen."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-lgbt-school-assemblies-prompt-more-than-three-quarter-of-children-to-stop-using-homophobic-language","story":"              MORE than three quarters of Scots pupils who\u0026rsquove attended LGBT inclusive assemblies in schools stopped using homophobic language as a direct result, new research has revealed.

Furthermore, of those pupils who said they previously held negative views towards the LGBT community, 86 per cent said their attitudes had changed positively after attending the assemblies.  The figures came from a survey conducted by the TIE Campaign, which is currently lobbying the Scottish Government to introduce statutory LGBT inclusive education across all schools in Scotland. While its parliamentary work has been going on, the group has been conducting assemblies on an invitation basis, across Scotland, in efforts to tackle the use of homophobic language in schools, reduce bullying and offer young people more information.  Recently, TIE has been collecting data from schools in a developing international research partnership with Purdue University in Indiana, USA, and the latest figures are based on a random sample of 1004 pupils from various schools across the country following participation in TIE\u0026rsquos LGBT awareness assemblies.  Liam Stevenson, TIE Campaign co-founder, said: \"This new data confirms that more and more young people are reflecting on their attitudes, their use of language, and their behaviour with regards to homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia.  \"For us, this further proves that LGBT inclusive lessons, workshops, and classroom discussions are the remedy to a long lasting culture of silence regarding the LGBT community in our schools.  \"Our services last one hour - imagine what will be achieved with LGBT history and culture embedded across the curriculum and a whole school approach towards inclusion and equality?\"  The news comes after MSPs celebrated the third anniversary of the campaign on Thursday, just before parliamentary recess began. MSPs, including Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie and Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, wore rainbow coloured ties \u0026ndash the campaign\u0026rsquos emblem \u0026ndash as a show of support, while First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wore a campaign badge.  Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government is working with TIE to, and I\u0026rsquom quoting, \u0026lsquopromote an inclusive approach to sex and relationships education\u0026rsquo. This work is being done through the LGBTI inclusive education working group. That working group is chaired by the Association of Directors of Education.  \u0026ldquoIt includes representation from the Scottish Transgender Alliance, LGBT Youth Scotland and Stonewall Scotland, and recommendations from the working group are expected in autumn of this year. At that point I\u0026rsquom sure everybody across the chamber will have an interest \u0026ndash I know the Government, and me as First Minister, will have an interest \u0026ndash in making sure that these recommendations are implemented as quickly as possible.  The TIE Campaign, co-founded by Stevenson and Jordan Daly, hopes to tackle homophobic bullying in schools by weaving LGBT education into the schools curriculum. Previous research carried out by the group revealed that nine out of 10 LGBT people had experienced homophobia, biphobia or transphobia at school, and more than a quarter had attempted suicide at least once as a result. Eighty per cent of teachers felt they had not been adequately trained in how to deal with the issues.  TIE is working with the Scottish Government on developing its proposals, and Daly and Stevenson believe they are close to seeing their aims come to fruition.  CASE STUDY  Chloe Divers, guidance teacher at Brannock High School, Motherwell  When the TIE Campaign tweeted about a training session for teachers I went along and absolutely loved it. Jordan and Liam [TIE Campaign co-founders] were there, and I asked them to come into the school and do assemblies for us. Everything took off from there.  We started an LGBT Alliance group in the school, which lots of kids got involved in. It was only once a week, on a Friday lunch time, but at one point I was having up to 70 kids in my classroom \u0026ndash not all LGBT, a lot them allies as well. There was obviously a real appetite in the school and kids were interested.  Then we had the TIE Campaign come in and hold some whole school assemblies. They were really strong at putting across the message. It was interesting because we found the lower year groups, the first and second years, were really open to it. The seniors were more closed to it but then really opened up after we\u0026rsquod had the TIE Campaign in. Jordan was so honest when talking about his journey. I really noticed there was a significant change in the student body.  From then, we put it out to the pupils, the student council, to find out what they wanted to be taught. We started to get feedback on things like sexual health we had one boy saying that pupils get taught about safe sex, but that it was very male-female dominated and they weren\u0026rsquot taught about safe sex within same-sex relationships.  We\u0026rsquove since been on our LGBT charter award journey with LGBT Youth Scotland and we\u0026rsquove just received silver status on that which we\u0026rsquore delighted about. We\u0026rsquove had a very quick year in this school \u0026ndash we only started this in August and I would say there\u0026rsquos been a real shift in the mindset of the school, and it\u0026rsquos not just the students, it\u0026rsquos the teachers as well.  We found after the assemblies that a lot of teachers were saying how fantastic it was that we\u0026rsquod had TIE in, and that they wanted to support LGBT students but were scared they wouldn\u0026rsquot know how to do it, that they would say the wrong thing or not know the appropriate information to give them. Teachers still have that fear, so we were able to do staff training with TIE as well to help teachers feel more confident in speaking to pupils.  In terms of homophobic bullying and the words we would hear being used \u0026ndash sometimes not even directed at someone who\u0026rsquos gay, but what kids would call \u0026ldquobanter \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos been a really significant change in that. We\u0026rsquove got a culture now where other pupils are happy to call it out as well, they\u0026rsquore happy to challenge it. There\u0026rsquos a real shift in culture. We know statistically that it\u0026rsquos had an impact because we\u0026rsquove had more events of homophobic bullying being recorded.  An example is one pupil who earlier in the year was experiencing homophobic bullying. He wouldn\u0026rsquot even get out of bed to come to school. The bullying wasn\u0026rsquot within the school gates, it was out in the community, but it involved boys from the school. We tackled that in the school through this education. He was at the point of leaving, but now he\u0026rsquos coming back. He sat exams this year that he otherwise wouldn\u0026rsquot have sat, and he\u0026rsquos already picked his subjects for next year.  We\u0026rsquore also finding the TIE Campaign has helped shift attitudes around gender norms. One of my colleagues, a computing teacher, has found she has more female students signing up when traditionally it was more male. She thinks because we\u0026rsquove tackled this as a whole that we\u0026rsquove challenged stereotypes and broken down gender norms. So we\u0026rsquore finding it\u0026rsquos breaking through into choices now as well.  I think full LGBT inclusive education would make a significant impact on kids. What\u0026rsquos happened with us is that we\u0026rsquove driven it, but I think there\u0026rsquos a lot of schools that aren\u0026rsquot doing that, they\u0026rsquove not changed their courses. It\u0026rsquos time to really wake up and realise LGBT kids are looking for something more specific to them, but we don\u0026rsquot need to exclude each other. Why are we only discussing man and woman? Why are we not discussing two men and two women as well? By discussing it all in the classroom it makes it the norm for every child, and hopefully makes it the norm when they go out into society."},{"url":null,"title":"profile-the-single-finger-salute-from-the-hand-of-god-that-went-around-the-world","story":"              TYPICAL Maradona. It may be many years since he last kicked - or, for England fans with long and unforgiving memories, handled - a ball in anger, but he still has the knack of attracting media attention.  At the World Cup in Russia, he is a mere spectator, but his florid gestures and undignified behaviour - plus, let\u0027s be honest, the fact that he was one of the greatest footballers ever - have generated scores of headlines across the world.  He made a one-finger gesture on both hands after Argentina scored a second goal against Nigeria at Saint Petersburg Stadium. Gary Lineker and Rio Ferdinand publicly indicated their distaste, and Lineker observed: \"There\u0027s a danger he\u0027s becoming a laughing stock, I\u0027m afraid.\"  At another game, Maradona was witnessed pulling his eyes to the side while glancing at South Korean fans. He smoked a cigar in a non-smoking stadium.  In his general exuberance he has leaned so far over balconies that his friends - or perhaps they were security personnel - had to place restraining hands on him to stop him from toppling over. Then there was a reported health scare, and a binge on white wine.  Given that Diego Maradona is a global ambassador for Fifa, and is paid at least \u0026pound10,000 plus expenses for each game he attends in that capacity, you can understand why the ruling body\u0027s generosity has come under scrutiny in recent days.  The USA Today newspaper said midweek that it was clear that the 57 year old is a \"troubled man, whose problems are not helped by having him at front and centre of a global spotlight\", and who, after years of excess, is now a caricature of his former celebrity self yet feels the pressure to live up to it.  The player\u0027s former agent, Jon Smith, told the BBC: \u0026ldquoHe quite enjoys being a parody of himself at times. Diego is a really high-energy guy and has always been that way. His problem at the moment is he doesn\u0026rsquot sleep so he takes these sleeping pills. And if he interacts with other substances during the days, such as alcohol, it has an effect on him. I just hope one day he doesn\u0026rsquot do something stupidly excessive and something silly happens.  Maradona was an outrageously talented football player. What he could do with the ball, sportswriter Marcela Mora y Araujo wrote in  this week, \"was proof if any were needed that football at its best is an art form. His entire being, body and mind, could do with a ball what the greatest composers in history have done with musical notes, the most notable artists with a brush and some paint, the best writers with words, pen and paper. Diego \u0027rewrote the 10 commandments of football\u0027 and performed miracles. His ability to rotate his ankle 360 degrees was matched by his peripheral vision, able to make out detail and movement all around him.\"  In the 1986 World Cup quarter finals in Mexico, Maradona scored twice in the space of a few minutes to enable Argentina to beat England 2-1. The first goal saw him challenge England goalkeeper Peter Shilton for the ball - and fist it home with his self-declared \u0027Hand of God\u0027. The second goal, however, saw him receive the ball in his own half and surge unstoppably towards Shilton, leaving a trail of players in his wake before scoring. \"It was a tremendous effort, and the man is a genius,\" England manager Bobby Robson acknowledged afterwards. Argentina went on to beat West Germany to lift the trophy.  Maradona was raised in a shanty town outside Buenos Aires. Legend has it that he once fell into an open sewer and had to be rescued by an uncle. He was a talented footballer from an early age and he made his debut with Argentinos Juniors, in 1976, shortly before his 16th birthday. In 1981 he signed for Boca Juniors, where he enhanced his reputation. Spanish giants Barcelona paid a then-world record transfer fee to secure his services, a feat repeated when he went to Italian club Napoli two years later. After playing in his native country again until 1997 he managed a number of clubs, and coached the Argentina national team at the 2010 World Cup.  Maradona\u0027s individual brilliance has led to him being declared as the greatest footballer ever. Lionel Messi has been quoted as saying: \u0026ldquoEven if I played for a million years, I\u0027d never come close to Maradona. He\u0027s the greatest there\u0027s ever been.  Maradona chronicled his turbulent life and occasional anarchistic streaks in his gripping 2004 autobiography, El Diego. Much has been made over the years of his health problems and his ballooning weight, his flirtations with Fidel Castro and Venezuela\u0027s Hugo Chavez. In 2004 - obese, and addicted to cocaine - he came close to death.  One Argentinian sports editor now says that many in the country are disappointed with Maradona\u0027s single-finger gesture and believe it does not put Argentina in a good light abroad.  But Maradona is as Maradona does. London-based sportswriter Matt Dickinson, who knows him well, said this week that Maradona has never compromised or played by the rules, and is unlikely to start now. Nor does he give a damn to those who found the sight of him in Russia as sad, boorish or pathetic.  \"To meet him, to experience the charisma first hand,\" writes Dickinson, \"is to be captivated by one of the most compelling figures in the history of sport, with all his greatness, chaos and defiance.\""},{"url":null,"title":"phew-what-a-scorcher-heres-how-scotscorchio-really-affected-scotland","story":"              YES, it\u0026rsquos been hot - but it\u0026rsquos going to get hotter. And windier, wetter, stormier and, yes, colder.  Those are the warnings from climate change experts in the wake of last week\u0026rsquos very high temperatures. The vagaries of the interactions between the world\u0026rsquos complex meteorological system and humanity\u0026rsquos carbon pollution mean that the weather in Scotland in the future will be more chaotic, more extreme and more dangerous, they say.  Last week\u0026rsquos sweltering hot spell caused trains to be cancelled or delayed to prevent rails buckling, forest wildfires, police warnings about leaving pets in hot cars and official pleas to use water wisely. It also caused black goo to melt and dribble down the supposedly weather-proof roof of the Glasgow Science Centre.  But there have also been some upsides. This year\u0026rsquos strawberry and raspberry crops are expected to be exceptionally good, non-polluting solar power has been breaking all records and \u0026ndash apart from those on the east coast shrouded in haar \u0026ndash most people have been enjoying the sun.  According to the Met Office, the hottest place in Scotland on Thursday was Bishopton in Renfrewshire, where the mercury reached 31.9 degrees in the shade. That\u0026rsquos not far off the highest June temperature ever recorded in Scotland, which was 32.2 degrees at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross back in 1893.  Several other places recorded temperatures of 30 degrees or over on Thursday, including Tyndrum in Stirling, Aviemore in Highland, Strathallan in Perthshire and Braemar in Aberdeenshire. The lowest maximum on the Scottish mainland was Inverbervie on the north east coast at 20.4 degrees.  It was much cooler however, on the northern isles, with Kirkwall on Orkney only reaching 17.7 degrees, Fair Isle 14.5 degrees and Unst in Shetland 14.3 degrees. The place to register the lowest maximum on Thursday - 11.7 degrees - was Sule Skerry, a tiny island 60 kilometres west of Orkney (see table below).  The Met Office confirmed that June had been unusually hot. Scotland\u0026rsquos average daily maximum temperature up to June 27 was 17 degrees, two degrees higher than the June average since 1910.  It was similarly hot in June 2010, but hotter in June 1970. The highest June temperatures since records began was in 1940, when the average daily maximum reached 18.8 degrees.  Professor James Curran, a certified meteorologist and the former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), has been measuring the temperature in his garden at Uddingston. On Thursday it reached 34.3 degrees.  That would make it the highest ever recorded in Scotland in June - except that it wasn\u0026rsquot an official measurement done in accordance with Met Office protocols.  Curran chairs the government-funded body aiming to prepare for global warming, Climate Ready Clyde.  \u0026ldquoWe have identified heat as an issue we need to prepare for in Scotland, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt can cause wildfires and also seriously disrupt rail travel. Both of those have been experienced in the last few days with a huge moorland fire near Manchester, which also caused heavy air pollution, and cancellation of trains at Glasgow Central Station. There have also been numerous health warnings issued recently.  Climate predictions suggested that summers are likely to be around four degrees hotter in Scotland in the 2080s, Curran pointed out. \u0026ldquoThe hottest days will be even warmer and be around six to eight degrees hotter than now, he said.  \u0026ldquoOver the last 100 years the frequency of heatwaves across Europe has already trebled. We should remember how dangerous extreme heat can be \u0026ndash since around 40,000 people died in the European heat wave of 2003, with more than 2,000 in England.  Curran highlighted how variable the weather was becoming, with Storm Hector bringing unusually high winds earlier in June and a long, cold winter with severe blizzards. \u0026ldquoClimate change could well be driving this variability, he told the Sunday Herald.  Because the Arctic has been warming much faster than elsewhere on the planet, the temperature difference between mid and high latitudes is declining. This causes the jet stream, a powerful high altitude wind that usually brings mild weather, to weaken and meander, he explained.  \u0026ldquoThese meanders allowed the jet stream to drift south in winter \u0026ndash hence we were in the cold air on the northern side and experienced snow and frost. Now it has drifted way north, providing us with extreme heat.  Friends of the Earth Scotland warned that the weather was giving \u0026ldquovery clear signals that our climate is changing. \u0026ldquoAs records tumble we enter new territory and we should be worried, said the environmental group\u0026rsquos director, Dr Richard Dixon.  \u0026ldquoSome extra summer heat is no doubt welcome for many but the bigger picture is of more energy in the global atmosphere leading to bigger storms, more floods and more severe heatwaves.  There have been days of cancellations and delays on on the railway network, with problems with points at Paisley triggering further problems on Friday morning. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore really sorry to our customers whose journeys have been disrupted over the past few days, said a spokesperson for the Scotrail Alliance.  According to Network Rail, tracks in direct sunshine could heat to as much as 50 degrees, causing expansion and risking buckling. Slowing down trains helps to reduce the pressure of the tracks, and some are painted white to reflect the heat.  Forest Enterprise Scotland reported two wildfires last week. One near Fauldhouse in West Lothian on Wednesday required 50 firefighters and the other was in north Scotland.  Land managers have been warned of a high fire risk due to the dry weather. \u0026ldquoOur advice to people is to use their common sense, and to be particularly careful when out in the forests, said a spokesperson for the government agency.  Scottish Water is monitoring water supplies across Scotland closely. \u0026ldquoWe have issued advice to customers to use water wisely in two localised areas, parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis, said a spokesperson.  \u0026ldquoThe advice was issued in these areas because of prolonged dry weather and lower than normal levels in the River Spey, from which water in most of Moray is sourced, and lower than normal levels in a loch that supplies Stornoway water treatment works.  Sepa is planning to tour north and north-east Scotland to advise farmers and others how to reduce their use of water from lochs and rivers. \u0026ldquoOur staff are prioritising visits to catchments with lower water levels to assess and mitigate any potential environmental impacts, said the agency\u0026rsquos chief officer, John Kenny.  \u0026ldquoWith further hot weather forecast over the coming week, we continue to monitor the situation with partners across Scotland, and will work closely with water users to ensure that the environment and other water users are not impacted as a result of this dry spell.  The National Farmers Union in Scotland described the prolonged dry spell as \u0026ldquoa welcome relief after 12 months of dreadful weather. \u0026ldquoThe quality of the winter fodder made to date is likely to have been tremendous and early reports on the soft fruit harvest suggests exceptional quality, said NFU Scotland president, Andrew McCornick.  \u0026ldquoI am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity. That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain in the next wee while.  National Grid, which distributes electricity across the UK, reported that generation from photovoltaic solar cells topped eight gigawatts for eight days in a row from 21-28 June. That\u0026rsquos a record, said a company spokesperson.  Some 533 gigawatt-hours of solar electricity was produced in a week, making up between 10 and 20 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos electricity demand.  Conservationists urged people to be careful and to help wild animals in the heat. \u0026ldquoWildfires can have a devastating impact on wildlife during their breeding season, particularly ground nesting birds such as skylarks and meadow pipits, said Rory Syme from the Scottish Wildlife Trust.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod urge people to be vigilant for fires and also to avoid lighting open fires during the current dry spell.  He pointed out that wildlife needed access to water and shelter in hot weather. \u0026ldquoPeople can help by leaving out water for birds and other animals in their gardens, making sure to replacing it every few days so it\u0026rsquos kept clean, he added.  \u0026ldquoShelter can be something as simple as a pile of logs or leaves, and more fastidious gardeners might want to invest in a purpose-built bug hotel. Keeping flowers well watered can help ensure that bees and other insects have access to pollen and nectar.

Sunday\u0026rsquos fresh reckoning came a day after a break in the constant rainfall had lowered water levels, bringing hope that the muddy water inside the crucial but clogged chamber would recede and expedite divers\u0026rsquo movement forward.  The boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach entered the sprawling Tham Luang Nang Non cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai after a football game on June 23. There is hope they can survive if they have found a dry spot in which to shelter.  An announcement on the Facebook page of the Thai navy Seal unit shortly before midnight on Saturday said they had penetrated only about 200m \u0026mdash one fifth of the way forward in the crucial chamber, about as far as they had made it much earlier in the search before being forced to retreat by rising waters.  An army commander, Major General Bancha Duriyapat, said on Sunday that authorities remain hopeful.  \u0026ldquoOverall, it\u0026rsquos good. It is good news that rain has stopped. We continue to work in all areas, including pumping the water out from water sources all around the mountain so that we can help those who work inside the cave, he said.  Chaiwat Dusadeepanich of the Department of Groundwater Resources explained on Saturday that his team, which had been drilling for two days, found a small underground water source near the cave.  He said they would keep drilling deeper in order to find a way to release the water at a high rate.  The search has been going slowly, largely because flooding has blocked rescuers from going through chambers to get deeper into the cave.  Pumping out water has not solved the problem, so the attention has focused on finding shafts on the mountainside that might serve as a back door to the blocked-off areas where the missing may be sheltering.  Teams have been combing the mountainside looking for fissure that might lead to such shafts.  Several have been found and explorers have been able to descend into some, but so far it is not clear whether they lead to anywhere useful.  Experts in cave rescues from around the world continued to gather at the site.  An official Australian group has now followed a USmilitary team, British cave experts, Chinese lifesaving responders and several other volunteer groups from various countries."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-aide-says-nicola-sturgeons-reshuffle-lacked-due-diligence","story":"              THE chief of staff to Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos predecessor has criticised the lack of \u0026ldquodue diligence in advance of last week\u0026rsquos botched reshuffle.  Geoff Aberdein said the First Minister\u0026rsquos inner circle would be \u0026ldquokicking themselves over the on-off appointment of Gillian Martin as a minister.  Ms Sturgeon gave Ms Martin the further and higher education brief on Wednesday, but was forced to cancel her appointment the following day over her past blog writings.  In 2007, Ms Martin, then a college lecturer, had mocked transgender people and written in unflattering terms about \u0026ldquoAmerican Jews and \u0026ldquoAmerican blacks.  Ms Sturgeon had previously been aware of some of the transgender comments, including the notion of a \u0026ldquotranny trove of EU cash, as the blog was widely reported in 2016.  However more offensive material surfaced after Ms Martin was named a minister, including a remark about \u0026ldquohairy knuckled lipstick-wearing transitional transgender Laydees in colleges.  One of Ms Martin\u0026rsquos roles would have been to promote widening access to minorities.  Opposition parties said the episode had highlighted Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos poor judgment.  On BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Mr Aberdein, who who was Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos top adviser from 2011 to 2014, was asked whether the reshuffle showed the SNP government was losing its previous sure-footedness.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt was unfortunate.  \u0026ldquoThe whole purpose of this reshuffle was to enter the summer recess on a high, with a bit of momentum, and of course the Gillian Martin saga has tarnished that.  \u0026ldquoI think the people around Ms Sturgeon will be kind of kicking themselves about the lack of due diligence here. Perhaps not as sure-footed as before.  \u0026ldquoBut you\u0026rsquove got to remember these things come and go very quickly, and in a couple of days we\u0026rsquoll forget about this, and the focus will be on the ministerial [team].  He suggested that if there had been better planning, the SNP could have headed off the media stories that followed the appointment.  Now global head of public affairs at Standard Life Aberdeen, Mr Aberdein said: \u0026ldquoHad that due diligence been done, then perhaps they might have been able to proactively, the SNP, deal with that, maybe spike it... as a political mechanism to see where the land lies beforehand, but of course that wasn\u0026rsquot done.  \u0026ldquoIt came as a surprise, and the result was there for all to see.  The U-turn on Ms Martin\u0026rsquos appointment means there will be no further and higher education minister until after the Holyrood recess, as MSPs must confirm the post.  However Ms Sturgeon could appoint a minister-designate over the summer, who could learn the brief in readiness for confirmation in September.  Edinburgh University\u0026rsquos Professor Lindsay Paterson, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos foremost education experts, said it would be helpful if a new provisional minister was named.  Liam McCabe, president of the National Union of Students, Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoIt is vital that the government priorities appointing a new minister as a matter of urgency."},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago. Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.        Donna said: \u0026ldquoWe were increasingly aware of the vulnerability of the oil and gas industry, and although we both had good jobs, our working days were getting longer and more stressful which began to impact on our family life, so the timing seemed to lend itself to a total lifestyle change.\"My mum and grandmother are regulars at Salt Caves in Inverness and Edinburgh, and both had seen a significant reduction in their respective symptoms and an upturn in their general wellbeing. My grandmother, who\u0026rsquod had to give up singing due to breathing problems a number of years ago, is now back performing with her choir and she says that\u0026rsquos thanks to The Salt Cave.\u0026ldquoTheir positive experiences coupled with our desire to change career direction, led us to research the industry.

Our adviser undertook a property search on our behalf and provided invaluable information on commercial leasing and the documentation we needed to provide to secure it.

Carron Taylor, Business Gateway, said: \u0026ldquoDeciding to take a new career path can be a gamble but it\u0026rsquos one that is paying off for Donna and Jason as their enterprise has proven to be a hit. The couple have always had a clear vision of what they want to achieve, and have used our support to establish the franchise in Aberdeen. Continued support through our European funded Business Boost programme will help them access additional advice to grow their customer base further.Having worked in the nuclear industry in Caithness, Donna moved to Aberdeen in 2014 where she took up a position in commercial leadership in North Sea brownfield and decommissioning while Jason continued to work offshore while studying for a degree in Mechanical Engineering.Knowing first-hand the strain that long hours and stress can have on people\u0026rsquos health, the couple are now focusing their attention on attracting clients from the corporate world for whom salt therapy can offer relief from health issues and aid with stress management and relaxation.Donna added: \u0026ldquoWe know from experience that work, more often than not, comes before taking care of ourselves.

During questions in the Commons, he asked the Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation what the UK Government is doing to increase the take-up of STEM subjects - guaranteeing a generation of well-equipped workers.        Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Sunday 1 Jul 2018 10:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

You might even be able to buy your own one!The pupils had been working on the concept of improving cycling safety since January and came up with the idea of covering a bike in Led lights.The bike was coded using a BBC micro:bit and buttons were wired up to have functions such as working indicators, brake lights \u0026ndash which turn the whole bike red \u0026ndash and a speedometer, as well as customisable colours.Pupils taking part in Apps for Good explore all aspects of product development, from the initial idea and programming to product design and marketing.Mr Aitken says he hopes to build on the success of the Light Bike by setting up an Inventors\u0026rsquo Club in Wick High and possibly a CoderDojo \u0026ndash part of a network of computer programming clubs \u0026ndash for primary children.This week\u0026rsquos category win was the latest in a series of Apps for Good achievements by teams from Wick High.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been incredibly lucky to have seen success now at the Apps for Good Awards for six years running \u0026ndash an unbeaten record, Mr Aitken said.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen our ideas evolve from the creation of wireframe prototypes to full-blown apps and we\u0026rsquore now pushing the boundaries further with the introduction of Internet of Things, physical computing, and very soon we\u0026rsquoll be starting machine learning / artificial intelligence with our pupils.\u0026ldquoAs always, I\u0026rsquom excited for what the future may bring for Wick High School pupils.Sunday 1 Jul 2018 10:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 1, 2018 at 3:42 pmWick runner Bryan Newlands took the win in the St Magnus Marathon, as close to 70 runners participated in the UK\u0026#8217s most northerly marathon.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Sunday 1 Jul 2018 10:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762286.1530442869!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures liam gallagher closes day 2 of trnsmt festival","story":"\t\tTens of thousands of music lovers once again flocked to a sold out Glasgow Green for day two of Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest music festival, and as TRNSMT fans bathed in glorious temperatures - with Glasgow reaching higher temperatures than Madrid \u0026#8211 acts like Gerry Cinnamon, Kyle Falconer, Courteeners and Krept and Konan took to the stage.\t\t\t\t• VIEW THE FULL GALLERY HERE            Kicking things off on the Main Stage were Glasgow’s very own The LaFontaines with frontman Kerr Okan delighting the crowd as the band made their second consecutive appearance at the festival.

Thanks for watching us, you are part of this band!”Shed Seven followed with hits including ‘Disco Down’ and ‘Going for Gold’ as well as a cover of Stone Roses ‘I Am the Resurrection’ Krept x Konan, the London-based hip-hop duo who have seen a gradual rise to prominence over the last few years, took to the stage before the arrival  of possibly the most anticipated performance of TRNSMT’s first weekend - Gerry Cinnamon’s Main Stage set. Just one year ago the local star took to the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage, now a year later thousands of fans displayed their adoration for the one man show with just an acoustic guitar the singer-songwriter from Castlemilk once again had the crowd eating out of his hands.             Fans over on the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage were also treated to a strong line-up of both promising and established acts throughout the day, including openers The Night Café, BAS, The Academic, Scottish natives The Snuts and Kyle Falconer, who provided an insight into his upcoming solo album. Ramz and IAMDDB continued the party into the early evening, before The Sherlocks closed proceedings with their straight-down-the-line indie sound.As the evening rocked on, Wolf Alice’s performed hits such as ‘Silk’ and newer material including ‘Don’t Delete the Kisses’, before the Courteeners took the Main Stage.Ten years on from the release of their, now iconic, debut album St Jude, Courteeners wowed their fans with tunes like ‘Not Nineteen Forever’, ‘Notion’ and ‘Cavorting’.            Headline act Liam Gallagher then arrived stating: “So this is the famous Glasgow Green then? I’ve heard a lot about it.” The former Oasis frontman’s performance then documented his 25-year career as one of the country’s most popular figures, with solo tunes such as ‘Wall of Glass’ and ‘Greedy Soul’ tucked between Oasis classics such as ‘Morning Glory’ and ‘Wonderwall’.Geoff Ellis, Festival Director said: “Today has had so many highlights from the mass Shed Seven singalong to the absolute class of Liam Gallagher’s set. One of the biggest moments for me was watching local boy Gerry Cinnamon completely command the Main Stage in front of his biggest ever crowd.

Having proposed that Martin should be made a new minister in last week’s reshuffle, Sturgeon was forced to withdraw her nomination when it emerged she had made a series of offensive blog posts.            Her withdrawal has left the post vacant as teenagers are waiting for Higher results and the Scottish Government is supposed to be concentrating on widening access to university for poorer entrants.Professor Lindsay Paterson of Edinburgh University, one of Scotland’s foremost education experts who has advised the Scottish Parliament, said the position that Martin was to have held was a “very important post”.He said the sector was undergoing major changes including moves to widen access, close the attainment gap between rich and poor and a debate about funding for colleges. “I think it would certainly help [if Gillian Martin was replaced soon],” Paterson told Scotland on Sunday. “When people talk about the attainment gap – the social class related attainment gap –  the thing that is probably prominent in most people’s minds is widening access to university, especially to the older universities.             “Some of the initiatives the government has taken are attempting to address that and some of the criticism of the government has said it is not enough. It is absolutely at the heart of the debate and it continues. “One of the most intense periods of debate about this is the summer when the Highers results come out, \u2028and then when new students start arriving at university and the new cycle of university applications starts in the autumn. It is a very good opportunity for a prominent politician to stimulate debate and it would be a pity if there was to be a vacuum there.”Liam McCabe, president of the National Union of Students, Scotland, said a new minister had to be appointed as soon as possible.“It is vital that the government prioritises appointing a new minister as a matter of urgency,” said McCabe. “There are a number of opportunities that require immediate ministerial attention. Universities are falling short of their widening access targets, there’s a growing mental health crisis on our campuses, and we need to see steps taken towards achieving the government’s newly announced ambition to give every student a support package tied to the real living wage.”            Martin’s promotion was reversed on the last day of the Holyrood term after details of a blog mocking trans people and discussing the restaurant tipping habits of “blacks” and “Jews” were publicised.Sturgeon took the decision not to put her nomination before parliament when it became clear it would not secure widespread parliamentary support. With Holyrood now in recess for two months, Martin’s successor cannot be formally approved unless parliament is recalled. In the meantime, the Scottish Government has said a “minister designate” could be appointed. However concerns have been expressed that such an arrangement would see the new appointee lack legal status.Sturgeon’s spokesman said the position would be filled “in due course”. He added: “As Education Secretary, the Deputy First Minister [John Swinney] will be in charge of all of these things in the meantime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

The wooden boat was taking in water in rough seas in the Roost.\n into Lerwick harbour.\nShetland Coastguard watch officer Alex Dodge said: “The 14 on board were all safe and well. The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
