Mellen lives in Hell\u0027s Kitchen in New York\u0027s Midtown West.  He owns a 700-sq ft apartment in one of the big, multi-amenity apartment blocks overlooking the Hudson  that serve\u0027s a large part of the city\u0027s professional community. First impressions of his apartment on the 9th floor are: NEAT, NEAT and NEAT. Everything has its place.  It\u0027s a simple but effective logic that forms the backbone to his book. If you keep your keys in the same place, without fail, you will never waste time looking for them. Same for your phone charger and wallet. This valuable time, Andrew, says can be better spent doing things you actually enjoy. Note the shoe board for the three pairs he uses most often. A cupboard in the hall stores the others (in shoetrees of course)          \u0027If you can organize your kitchen you can organize your life\u0027: You will not very little plastic in Andrew\u0027s kitchen, nor will you find on a utensil out of place or an appliance that isn\u0027t used. Andrew says: \u0027Pots and pans should have lids, so shouyld food-storage containers (glass over plastic). Appliances should have all their parts. Groceries should be organized into categories. The kitchen should be broken down into zones: Preparation, cooking and baking, beverages, pantry, tableware and cleanup. Before putting a single item away, wash and wipe down the interiors of every cabinet and drawer. This system begins to unravel the minute you defer returning something to its home in favor if doing it later\u0027.          To achieve your dream kitchen Andrew recommends \u0027sitting down for a minute and breathing. Think about your dream kitchen. Think about the meals you\u0027ll make for those you love. Or even just like. Think about waking up in the morning, walking into the kitchen, pouring yourself or making a delicious cup of coffee. It\u0027s peaceful in this room. Things are put away and there\u0027s room to breathe. Room to plan and to spread out. Your knives are sharp, your dishes are clean\u0027.\u0027Horrible\u0027: South Norwood community appalled by Grenfell bonfireNancy Pelosi thanks candidates for returning House to DemsNo death penalty as Christopher Watts pleads guilty to murderX Factor judges and Dermot O\u0027Leary present Child of Courage awardBonfire night revellers mock survivors by burning Grenfell tower effigySadiq Khan talks about knife crime and gangs in London on GMBOverdramatic pug squeals in TERROR as he gets his nails cut\u0027Get out!\u0027 Texas election supervisor yells at voterUnion Jack flag burned on bonfire at fireworks display in ThornerInvestigation underway after boy 16 dies in suspected stabbingMichael Gove has \u0027absolute confident\u0027 in PM\u0027s Brexit plan    Glass over plastic: Andrew recommends this not just because it is more eco-friendly but also that it\u0027s more hygienic, easier to clean and feels better all around. He keeps all of this containers together with their corresponding lids in a drawer near to the sink in the preparation zone of his immaculate kitchen.           Andrew sharpens his knives regularly. HE recommends either doing it yourself or finding someone to do it. \u0027A sharp knife is  a happy knife. And a happy knife is a happy cook\u0027, he says.           The cutlery drawer in his kitchen sparkles. Wood cutlery container over plastic. \u0027Really be honest with yourself about how you live, how you want to live, and how you don\u0027t want to live. If you\u0027re tired of living in a fantasy of someday and ready to live your life as it actually is and, even more important, how you want it to be, chuck the stuff that is holding you back\u0027          He recommends the following simple guide to de-cluttering the kitchen. Ask yourself three questions: Is this object something I currently or frequently use? Is it beautiful? Do I enjoy looking at it. Does it serve a practical purpose in my kitchen? If the answer is no, get rid of it. \u0027Having a pizza stone is useless if you don\u0027t eat carbs, no matter how cool you think it is\u0027, he says.           Practical reclosable freezer bags are always kept stocked in his kitchen to ensure his freezer is kept well organized and items easily visible. So is Andrew OCD? Or just super organised. And whats\u0027s the difference? \u0027I know I\u0027m not OCD because i can go to sleep at night without having to move things\u0027. It\u0027s worth noting that what Mellen espouses is not rocket science, the way he lives is not completely unfamiliar. We all know what a tidy home looks like and we all know what we should do with our own homes to improve them. What Mellen specializes in is explaining the value of living like this and how, if you follow his process, you will free up more time and live a much calmer, productive life.He is the difference between you giving your apartment that one big spring clean before letting it gradually slide back into unorganized chaos and you finally being able to keep on top of the apartment\u0027s organisation and maintaining a clean and tidy place all of the time.\u0027If you act on my advice and are consistent and alert and apply yourself, you will have more time on your hands than you ever thought possible. You will do less, and you will accomplish more.            Andrew\u0027s bedroom is his oasis. His favorite thing? Pressed sheets. \u0027Without help, there\u0027s not a lot of time in the day to press and fold the linens. A tip is to remove the sheets and pillowcases from the dryer while they are still slightly damp and drape them over a shower rod to dry. It\u0027s the next best thing to ironing them, and they come out crisps and without wrinkles.          Art lines almost every wall in Andrew\u0027s apartment. His friends and family are artists and it is mainly there works which take pride of place. He practices Buddhism after dating a Zen monk for two years. This explains the nods to Buddha throughout the apartment. to the right of the dresser, in the  above picture next to the lamp, is an interesting object. It\u0027s an automatic watch winder for his kinetic watch. \u0027My watch is kinetic and I don\u0027t wear it all the time so this keeps it wound. I bought it off Amazon for approximately $40. It says much about Andrew\u0027s commitment to efficiency and not wasting time. Better to spend $40 than spend wasted minutes shaking the watch like most of us have to do EVERY time he goes to wear it.           Andrew calls drawers mini-closets on their sides. Like closets he recommends organizing them by type of clothing. The most important result of organizing your drawers is that \u0027you should be able to see the entire contents of each drawer easily as soon as you open it, as you can for your closets. A drawer should NOT be a crammed and jumbled mess of clothing.           Andrew even insists on keeping similar types of socks together. Thick socks, light socks etc. It\u0027s all fairly obvious advice, but seeing it in practice reminds one of how life becomes so much calmer and easier when things are in their place.           Andrew is all for photos from trips and travel but also believes \u0027people spend so much time documenting their excursions that the first time they actually experience being someplace different is when they get home and look back at photos taken and souvenirs gathered. By then, the experience is over and all you\u0027re left with are artifacts from history, albeit recent history. Put down the cameraand explore, experience, drink up the adventure while having the adventure\u0027.          The best way to strip back your closet and make sure it contains the things you actually use, Andrew recommends sitting down and deciding how many shirts you actually need, how many pairs of pants, shoes etc. If you decide on five long sleeve and five short sleeved shirts, make sure that when you buy a new shirt, get rid of an old one.  One of Andrew\u0027s tips for keeping a tidy closet and bedroom is returning those annoying wire hangers back to the dry cleaners for recycling, while keeping all of your hanging clothes on robust hangers. Couldn\u0027t agree more.  Belt and tie hooks make for easy visibility and reach. Andrew recommends also having a hook, an area or a chair where you can place clothes in \u0027purgatory\u0027 - \u0027the ones that aren\u0027t quite dirty but not quite clean, either. You\u0027d wear them again to run to the market or scrub the kitchen floor but maybe not for lunch  with your mother-in-law\u0027.  It was interesting to learn that Andrew has a housekeeper who also does his laundry and arranges his shirt, just as he requests: Short sleeves at one end, long sleeves at the other and color co-ordinated. Jeans and sweaters are folded and kept above. At first I thought the housekeeper surely means that it isn\u0027t Andrew who is Mr Organized, it\u0027s the staff. But, as Andrew says, it simply means he has more time for the valuable things in life. He knows how his home should be organized and he pays someone to do it. And she does a very good job.           Author Molly O\u0027Neill who sought the help of Andrew Mellen said he \u0027is efficient, no-nonsense, practical and persistent. He delivers order from chaos and he does it fast. I’m still not used to all the clean surfaces and orderly files and figuring out what to do with all the time and energy he’s saved me!\u0027          A sought-after authority on organizing and productivity, Andrew has addressed audiences from Dwell on Design and TEDx to The Great British Business Show and BlogHer\u0027You will always be able to find anything  - in your home or office, kitchen or car - within thirty seconds. You will never be late because you misplaced your keys. You will finally have the time to do the things you love to do. Or to discover the things you love. Or to rediscover them.\u0027What I do is guide you through a precise process that will enable you to unstuff your life of everything that doesn\u0027t serve you and shine a light on everything that does. How\u0027s that sound instead?\u0027Now, full disclosure: Mellen surprised me by revealing that he has a housekeeper. My first thought was surely that\u0027s cheating? The second was: She must have her work cut out. But as he explained, it\u0027s about time saving. He knows how he wants his home to look and how he wants it to make him feel. The fact he is paying someone to implement it simply means he has more free time to do the things he loves and focus on what he considers more valuable endeavors like building relationships with people, maintaining friendships and enjoying his work. You can, it turns out, still be America\u0027s most organized man and have a housekeeper to keep you organized.Dubbed \u0027America\u0027s Most Organized Man\u0027, rather surprisingly, Mellen began his life in the theater. He worked as executive and artistic director at community-based arts organization DC Arts Center in the early 1990s, before moving to Seattle to work as a playwright, actor, producer and director at Alice B. Theater.           \u0027I\u0027m not a minimalist, I\u0027m an essentialist\u0027, reveals Andrew. And he\u0027s no-nonsense too. Not only is he ruthless with his own belongings, but also gifts from other people. No way does he believe these things should clutter your home just because they were given as a present. \u0027Get rid of it as soon as possible. Any object that upon sight causes you pain, grief, regret, embarrassment or disappointment has no place in your life. Re-gift it\u0027.          Just because he espouses living simply and cleanly doesn\u0027t meant that Mellen shies away from color and pattern, as his quirky choice of chairs and artwork shows          Mellen takes inspiration from Buddhism and speaks frequently on the intersection of spirituality and organization at Omega Institute, San Francisco Zen Center, Tassajara, All Saints Church, JCC Manhattan and the Center for Spiritual Enlightenment, among others          Mellen believes clutter leads to an unhappy life, but what counts as clutter depends on the inidual. His vast collection of books, displayed in neat piles around his home, bring him happiness and therefore are not clutter          Mellen uses his apartment as a teaching tool for clients. Mellen leads workshops and speaks internationally while maintaining a private practice working with clients ranging from Fortune 100 companies, trade associations and non-profits to CEOs, filmmakers and authors, as well as overwhelmed parents everywhere          In 2013, Andrew founded Unstuff U®, the world\u0027s first virtual university dedicated to organization and decluttering, offering classes, workshops and other online resources for businesses and inidualsBut in 1996 he decided to take his career in a whole new direction. Following his passion for organization, he began working one-to-one with clients and multinational corporations including Goldman Sachs, American Express and Time, Inc. as a consultant for streamlining work, and keeping things simple.He also wrote a column for Real Simple (Ask the Organizer) and is still a frequent contributor for numerous news sources including Wall Street Journal, CNN Money and NPR, among others. Mellen also wrote best-selling book Unstuff Your Life! which includes his unique The Organizational Triangle®.This is a set of three simple rules to declutter 1: One home for everything, 2: Like with like, meaning similar objects should be stored together and 3: Something in, something out.   Andrew is also a member of the Experts Collective and serves on the faculty of the New York Open Center in New York City.

However, as discrepancies in the 2016 election proved, they should be viewed only as a very rough snapshot of polling data and not as a substitute for the actual election results.When will the election results be released?Although the votes will start to be counted as soon as each polling station officially closes, the actual results may take some time to filter in due to a number of reasons.The large number of absentee ballots, strong turnout and large size of states such as California, Texas and New York among others will likely mean that a number of races might not be called quickly, with some likely to be called on Wednesday, November 7 or even later.Still, with a number of key states closing their polls fairly early, the outcome of which party controls the House of Representatives could be determined before midnight.In some races, particularly governor’s races, runoff elections are triggered if no candidate breaks a certain vote threshold on Election Day, typically 50 per cent.          Heavy turnout and other factors could mean it might take a while for the results to be knownHouse of Representatives races to watchIn the lead-up to the election, much speculation has centered on whether the Democrats will be able to wrestle control of the House of Representatives from Republican hands. Although a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is by no means a sure thing, pollsters and analysts have predicted with increasing confidence in recent days that the chamber will indeed flip to Democratic control.FiveThirtyEight, for example, now gives the Democrats a nearly 88 per cent chance to retake the House of Representatives while the nonpartisan Cook Political Report is also predicting Democratic gains of 35 to 40 seats.A number of key races have emerged as critical in the House of Representatives as voters head to the polls on Election Day.In West Virginia’s third congressional district, which Donald Trump won easily in 2016, Democrat Richard Ojeda is running close with Republican Carol Miller in an open seat election.Many political observers are watching the race closely to see if Ojeda’s formula – notably his opposition to firearms background checks and fairly conservative views for a Democrat – could be the key for Democratic victories in districts loyal to Trump.Demographics has played a critical role in many recent elections in the US, and few places is this more evident than in Florida’s 26th congressional district where Republicans are trying to see if they can hold a seat in a mostly Latino district despite Trump’s polarizing views on immigration.Incumbent Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Republican, has enjoyed strong support in the district despite Hillary Clinton’s convincing victory there in 2016, though many Republicans fear his opponent, Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, could secure a victory.A similar situation has played out in Texas’s 23rd congressional district, home to a large number of undocumented immigrants. There, incumbent Republican Representative Will Hurd is facing a tough challenge from Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones, an Iraq War veteran who is of Filipina descent and openly gay.Hurd, notably, has tried to distance himself from Trump in the swing district.          Hurd, left, and Ortiz Jones, right, are both locked in a very close battle in Texas\u0027s 23rd districtRepublicans, however, are on the offense in Minnesota’s eighth congressional district, which was won by former President Barack Obama twice but swung to Donald Trump in 2016.An open seat election, Democrat Joe Radinovich is locked in a tight battle with Republican Pete Stauber as the Democrats try to hold the seat.In California, incumbent Republican Representative Mimi Walters is trying to fend off a tough challenge from Democrat Katie Porter in the state’s 45th congressional district, which encompasses Orange County. Republicans, once dominant in the district, have seen it become a close battleground in recent elections.Another close race is in Iowa’s fourth congressional district, where incumbent Republican Steve King is locked in a surprisingly tight battle after allegedly having ties to controversial far-right political parties in Europe.Senate races to watchThe Senate, where Republicans command a very narrow 51-49 majority, could very well flip to Democratic control, though most pollsters believe the Republicans will be able to hang on to their majority.As in the House of Representatives, several key races have emerged that will likely determine who controls the chamber in the wake of the election.In Nevada, incumbent Republican Senator Dean Heller is locked in a tough battle with Democratic challenger Representative Jacky Rosen, with both in a dead heat on Election Day.Another close race is in nearby Arizona, where Republican Representative Martha McSally is in the midst of an extremely close race with Democratic Representative Kyrsten Sinema as they both seek to become the state’s first female senator.In North Dakota, incumbent Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp is facing a very tough challenge from Republican Representative Kevin Crammer in a state Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in 2016.          Senator Heidi Heitkamp, above, is considered one of the most endangered Senate DemocratsAnother potential Republican pickup could be in Missouri, where incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill is in the midst of a very close race with Republican challenger Josh Hawley, who holds a very slim lead over her in most polls, though most pollsters and pundits predict the race is a tossup who’s outcome will be extremely close one way or another.In the perennial swing state of Florida, Democratic Senator Bill Nelson is also locked in a very close race with Republican Governor Rick Scott in what’s shaping up to be one of the most expensive races of the year.Texas also claims another close and interesting Senate race to watch. There, incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz is facing off against a surprisingly tough challenge from Democratic Representative Beto O’Rourke. Though most polls predict a narrow victory for Cruz, O’Rourke’s strong showing in traditionally Republican Texas has left many Republican leaders anxious.Governors’ races to watchAs many close races unfold for control of Congress, a number of governor’s races have also emerged as critical as Democrats look to pick up seats at the gubernatorial level as well.In Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams is running against Republican Brian Kemp in a bid to become the first African-American female governor in US history. In Vermont, another candidate is trying to make history as Democrat Christine Hallquist tries to become the first transgender governor in the United States, though most polls have her trailing incumbent Republican Governor Phil Scott.The Florida governor’s race has also emerged as key to watch as Democrat Andrew Gillum, the Mayor of Tallahassee, is locked in a close fight with Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a close ally of President Trump.Other close contests include in Iowa, where incumbent Republican Governor Kim Reynolds is facing a strong challenge from Democrat Fred Hubbell and in Nevada, where Democrat Steve Sisolak and Republican Adam Laxalt are currently deadlocked in the polls.EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Tuesday, November 6Election Day exit polls and results: When will we know the midterms outcome?Dancing With the Stars 2018: Fans flood Twitter with complaints after DeMarcus Ware exitTube Strikes: How November Central Line strikes could affect youElection Day 2018: Uber, Lyft and more free discounts and perksLynyrd Skynyrd UK Tour 2019: Tickets, dates, venues and moreIssues with your iPhone 6  and up battery?

Dr Tarek Tawfik, the director of the Grand Egyptian Museum, says the British Museum could replace the Rosetta Stone with a virtual reality replicaBut Dr Tawfik, whose $1billion museum is set to open with 50,000 exhibits near the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo in 2020, says it will have the technology to \u0027prolong their life.\u0027A British Museum spokeswoman said it has not received a request for the return of the Rosetta Stone from the Grand Egyptian Museum.\u0027In April, British Museum director Hartwig Fischer and colleagues visited the galleries at GEM with Dr Tawfik, which will allow a stunning new display of pharaonic Egypt,\u0027 she added to the Standard.The Rosetta Stone, which dates back to 196 BC, is one of the British Museum\u0027s most treasured exhibits.It was discovered by accident by Napolean\u0027s Army as they were digging in the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta in July 1799.After Napoleon\u0027s defeat, the stone was handed over to Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801 along with other antiquities the French found.It was shipped to England and arrived in Portsmouth in February 1802 and was soon put on display at the British Museum.          The Rosetta Stone has been on display at the British Museum (pictured) since 1802After a plea to Parliament for funds, construction began in a new gallery to house the acquisitions.It has been on display since 1802 with only one break towards the end of the First World War.The museum became concerned about heavy bombing in London in 1917 and the stone was moved to safety along with other important objects.It spent the next two years in a station on the Postal Tube Railway 50 feet below the ground at Holborn.In the early years of the 19th century, scholars used the Greek inscription on the Rosetta stone to crack the code of the hieroglyphs.Thomas Young, an English physicist, was the first to show that some of the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone wrote the sounds of a royal name: Ptolemy.French scholar Jean-François Champollion then realised that hieroglyphs recorded the sound of the Egyptian language.Champollion made a crucial step in understanding ancient Egyptian writing when he pieced together the alphabet of hieroglyphs used to write the names of non-Egyptian rulers.He announced his discovery in a paper at the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres at Paris in September 1822.Champollion made a second crucial breakthrough in 1824, realising that the alphabetic signs were used not only for foreign names, but also for the Egyptian language and names.Source: British Museum                                                     The knowledge of how to read and write hieroglyphs had long been forgotten – but in the years of the 19th century, scholars used the Greek inscription on the Rosetta stone to decipher them.And the Rosetta Stone is not the only object of contention in the British Museum.The case of the Elgin Marbles is one of the longest-running cultural disputes in the world.They were removed by a Scottish nobleman – Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin – from the Parthenon in the early 19th century when Athens was under Turkish rule.Greece wants them back, which Britain has consistently refused to do.

Twenty-five percent described health care and immigration as the most important issues in the election.Nearly two-thirds said Trump was a reason for their vote.Trump encouraged voters to view the first nationwide election of his presidency as a referendum on his leadership, pointing proudly to the surging economy at recent rallies.He bet big on a xenophobic closing message, warning of an immigrant \u0027invasion\u0027 that promised to spread violent crime and drugs across the nation. Several television networks, including the president\u0027s favorite Fox News Channel, yanked a Trump campaign advertisement off the air on the eve of the election, determining that its portrayal of a murderous immigrant went too far.One of Trump\u0027s most vocal defenders on immigration, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, lost his bid for governor. Kobach had built a national profile as an advocate of tough immigration policies and strict voter photo ID laws. He served as vice chairman of Trump\u0027s now-defunct commission on voter fraud.The president\u0027s current job approval, set at 40 percent by Gallup, was the lowest at this point of any first-term president in the modern era. Both Barack Obama\u0027s and Bill Clinton\u0027s numbers were 5 points higher, and both suffered major midterm losses of 63 and 54 House seats respectively.Democrats, whose very relevance in the Trump era depended on winning at least one chamber of Congress, were laser-focused on health care as they predicted victories that would break up the GOP\u0027s monopoly in Washington and state governments.Yet Trump\u0027s party will maintain Senate control for the next two years, at least.In Texas, Sen Ted Cruz staved off a tough challenge from Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke, whose record-smashing fundraising and celebrity have set off buzz he could be a credible 2020 White House contender.In Indiana, Trump-backed businessman Mike Braun defeated Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly.

It also pointed to increased public awareness of the problems that single-use products bring. The European parliament recently backed a ban on single-use plastics such as straws, cotton swabs, disposable plates and bottles and cutlery it is expected to come into effect in 2021. The UK is also planning to introduce a tax on plastic packaging.The dictionary defines single-use as “made to be used once only”, calling it “a term that describes items whose unchecked proliferation are blamed for damaging the environment and affecting the food chain”. It follows 2017’s word of the year, “fake news”, and 2016’s selection, Brexit.Other contenders for word of the year in 2018 included plogging, a Scandinavian craze in which joggers also pick up litter gammon, meaning “a person, typically male, middle-aged and white, with reactionary views, especially one who supports the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union” and floss, the victory dance performed in the video game Fortnite.Gaslight, meaning “to attempt to manipulate (a person) by continually presenting them with false information until they doubt their sanity”, has seen its usage increase 20-fold in the last five years, according to the dictionary, while MeToo, definined as “denoting a cultural movement that seeks to expose and eradicate predatory sexual behaviour, especially in the workplace”, was “transcending its original status as a social-media hashtag to become part of the language”. “This has been a year where awareness and often anger over a variety of issues has led to the rise of new words and the revitalisation and adaptation of old ones,” said head of language content Helen Newstead. “It’s clear from this year’s words of the year list that changes to our language are dictated as much by public concern as they are by sport, politics, and playground fads. The words in this year’s list perhaps highlight a world at extremes – at one end, serious social and political concerns, and at the other, more light-hearted activities.”All words in the list will be included on CollinsDictionary, and will be considered for inclusion in future print editions of the dictionary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b90d5b97037aca170ca29ccfa527c663c7a3b47/0_50_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978419049b4a08a63961a82d5a44015d","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Sometimes good books can be found in unusual places, as tommydog shows:I was up in the mountains fishing and on the cabin’s bookshelf was We Pointed Them North: Recollections of a Cow Puncher by EOC Abbott, aka Teddy Blue Abbott. It turned out to be a fun read and rather interesting. A friend, Helena Smith, basically wrote the book from Teddy’s dictation, poor grammar and all. He wanted to set the record straight in the late 1930s that while life on the post Civil War frontier was hard, it was also a lot of fun…It was a fun book, ideally suited to nights in a mountain cabin. In some of it you can see the source of countless western themes. Other aspects of life on the 19th century ranches are surprising (roller skating for example).Astonishing. Just in case you were wondering, here’s a definition of “cowpuncher”. (It isn’t someone who goes around thumping cows.)On the subject of frontiers, Dennis89 has been “thoroughly enjoying” The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard:A monumental account of Scott’s tragic 1912 expedition to the South Pole. Since starting this book I feel that my concentration at work has waned... My thoughts keep ferrying me off to the wonder, beauty and isolation of Antarctica. I walk home from work eager to get back into that world of crevasses, comradeship, endeavour and altruism. Yes, there are the formidable details of the journeys undertaken and the conditions experienced but the real joy lies within the description of the human relationships that are formed in such a hostile and unforgiving environment.But humans aren’t always so noble. William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies has brought back memories for quickspace:Just read Lord of the Flies for the first time, finishing it yesterday with the horror of boyhood re-emerging 41 years later, the panic and cruelty boys inflict on each other. Having gone to an all boys school after flunking my 11+, the hierarchy and mob mentality felt familiar, though I don’t think anyone was brutally murdered by a mob or had their brains bashed out by a fuck-off rock. Oddly, the description of Simon’s corpse reminded me the description of Curly’s wife after her death in Of Mice ... At least in tone, curiously poetic and so sad I bawled my eyes out, which I’m glad happened now and not in my school days.The Portable Dorothy Parker, “a collection of her short stories, poems, reviews and personal correspondence” has impressed JohnHunt:Everything in the book is short, though the book itself runs to just over 600 pages … Like Runyon, Parker is very much of time and place and, again like Runyon, the time runs from the 1920s to the early 1950s and the place is New York and its environs. Parker knows her characters and she’s betting that you have a passing familiarity with them as well. Her stories are told from an unapologetically female perspective, often a woman’s internal dialogue. If you appreciate a good zinger at the end, if you need someone who’s quotes you will be able to recall at just the right moments, if you are looking for a good laugh or a way to consider the female perspective from her time period, Parker is your sure guide.Parker also wrote A Star Is Born if you’re wondering if she is still relevant today. You just can’t go wrong.Anna Burns’ Milkman has worked for chasm:I’m surprised by the reviews that described it as a difficult read, I thought it pretty accessible. I also thought it the best Booker winner for some years, original, thought-provoking, humane, and unputdownable.Meanwhile, jinxsboy51 recommends The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister’s Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine by Lindsey Fitzharris:Very readable history of the transformation that occurred in medicine about the role of infection and sterilisation in making a big difference in surgery survival rates. NOT for the those with queasy stomachs.Finally, talking of stomachs, annegeraldine has been focussing on Thackeray’s Vanity Fair:The men have gone off to battle in Waterloo leaving Amelia a pitiful wreck and Becky planning her strategy should she be widowed. Joseph Sedley remains with the women: “At half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr Joseph -- the dinner-hour arrived.

The company said the closures would take place over the next two years.French tyremaker Michelin announced plans to close its factory in Dundee in 2020, nearly 50 years after it opened and where 845 people are employed. It blamed dwindling demand for smaller tyres. It said the decision was unrelated to the Brexit vote.At Schaeffler’s plant in Plymouth, a workforce of 350 people makes bearings and machine parts for the firm’s industrial ision as well as the aerospace and defence industries.At Llanelli, about 220 people are employed to make mechanical parts and bearings for the major car manufacturers and other industrial suppliers. The company said it would relocate production from the two UK factories to existing plants in the US, China, South Korea and Germany.The union Unite said it would “fight for every job” as it tries to avert the closures.Tony Burke, assistant general secretary, said: “This is yet another body blow for the UK’s automotive supply chain and the wider car industry. It should leave no one in any doubt as to what is in store if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal that secures tariff-free frictionless trade.“The uncertainty surrounding the Tories’ shambolic handling of Brexit and their piecemeal industrial strategy is having real consequences. Behind the closures and the uncertainty currently gripping the car industry and component manufacturing are people with bills to pay and families to feed.”The wider UK car industry has repeatedly urged the government to make frictionless trade a priority in Brexit negotiations or risk the loss of thousands of UK jobs.Schaeffler currently employs more than 1,000 people in the UK and said its factory in Sheffield would remain open, while operations at its two logistics centres in Sutton Coldfield and Hereford would be combined in Hereford.Michelin said it was no longer financially viable to keep its Dundee factory open because of a fall in demand for premium tyres of 16-inches and smaller, which are made at the site. It also blamed a shift in that market to low-cost versions made in Asia.John Reid, factory manager at Michelin Dundee, said: “I understand that these proposals will come as a huge blow to our employees and to the city of Dundee as a whole.

Our productivity is poor, levels of investment are meagre, and we cannot pay our way in the world,” he added.According to opinion polling on the economy commissioned by the IPPR, almost four fifths of Britons would describe the current crop of “leading politicians” from across the political ide as stale and unimaginative.Fewer than a quarter of people in the poll, which was conducted from more than 1,400 Sky customers, said they were confident that the government could come up with new ideas required to boost economic growth.Although launched by the centre-left IPPR, the winner of the new economics prize will be selected by a panel of senior business leaders and economists, chaired by Stephanie Flanders, the head of economics at Bloomberg.Mills will sit on the panel, alongside other judges including Helena Morrissey, the prominent City fund manager, Shriti Vadera, the chair of Santander UK, and John Eatwell, who is president of Queen’s College, Cambridge.It comes after the IPPR’s commission on economic justice, which included Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, called for a far-reaching and radical revamp of the UK economy to raise the standard of living of millions of workers.With a deadline of 6 January 2019, entrants for the economics prize will be asked to answer the question: “What would be your radical plan to force a step change in the quality and quantity of the UK’s economic growth?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/685f31f44f7740ae781cc960f155da3c1a077737/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d6a176d11412576f5facd5d4a84831c","title":"the guardian view on iran sanctions not upholding the rules but overturning them","story":"Current US policy has the clear goal of regime change. Europe must stand firmThe imposition of sanctions on Iran is designed to curb its “outlaw behaviour”, the US says. Donald Trump said the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action “cannot prevent an Iranian bomb” when he announced the US withdrawal from the treaty in May. This week his administration restored all sanctions lifted under the 2015 denuclearisation deal and added more (albeit with a six-month waiver for major oil customers). But the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN body policing the agreement, has verified repeatedly that Tehran has complied with its terms. European co-signatories agree. Meanwhile, Mr Trump has continued to attack the “worst deal ever” – while boasting of progress with North Korea, which already has a nuclear arsenal and is unlikely to reduce it, whatever its nice words. This is not about upholding rules and commitments it is about imposing might unilaterally.Tellingly, the administration has shifted its rhetorical justification to a laundry list of more general foreign policy demands which it knows Tehran will not and cannot agree to, however desirable some of those measures might be. Its stated aim of a better treaty does not deserve to be taken seriously. Lord Lamont, the UK’s trade envoy to Iran, says bluntly that the sanctions are aimed at regime change, whatever the US denials. The administration sees ordinary Iranians as an instrument but “ghost shipments” and barter with countries such as China, Russia and India will probably keep Iran going, and while Iranians will face real hardship, they are more likely to flee than rise against a repressive regime.The bigger picture is that the nuclear non-proliferation regime itself is at stake, as President Macron warned when the US first announced its decision. Last month, Mr Trump signalled that the US was withdrawing from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a critical pillar of the arms control system. Supporters say there is no point maintaining a treaty when the other party is not living up to it the counter to this is that Russia has succeeded in provoking the US to end the deal, giving Moscow entirely free rein. Others claim, not convincingly, that the treaty could prove a constraint in countering China in the Pacific. More significant surely is the hawkishness of secretary of state Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, who has a visceral loathing of arms control agreements – or anything that constrains the US as an international actor.This makes the prospect of renewing the US-Russia New START treaty, the remaining constraint on the world’s two largest nuclear stockpiles, even dimmer. Some hope it might be possible to sell Mr Trump a new agreement which he could claim as a personal success, as with North Korea. With Mr Bolton at his shoulder, that seems a very faint hope. If the deal lapses in 2021, the only impediment to a new arms race will be financial.Europe is still struggling to respond. It has attempted to counter the weaponisation of the dollar via a Special Purpose Vehicle, a clearing house allowing European firms to sidestep the Iran sanctions, but has yet to find a country willing to host it. Even if it does, few firms will risk their US business for Iranian deals. Yet as the French finance minister correctly identified earlier this year, this is not only about Iran but about European economic sovereignty. Such measures, even if symbolic for now, matter as a commitment to the international order and a sign of nascent alternatives to US might being wielded erratically and unilaterally.

Political roadkill or cockroach surviving a nuclear winter? Lib Dems themselves don’t quite know. Ask a local campaigner, and the answer will be rather optimistic. The party has done well in this year’s byelections, and the membership, galvanised by Brexit, has recently risen to almost 100,000. Crucially, the memory of the toxic coalition years appears to be fading: the disheartening phrase “tuition fees”, campaigners say, is no longer heard so often on doorsteps.It may not be entirely the fault of the current team. Traditional Lib Dem voters don’t necessarily love Europe, says Andrew Russell at the University of Liverpool, and the party’s heartlands are mostly in leave areas, meaning its anti-Brexit message has an uneasy relationship with the existing base. The party may have had the chance to emerge gloriously as a new political force, but many feel this chance was used (and blown) by Nick Clegg – now, symbolically perhaps, fleeing to a new career in Silicon Valley. Voters are now familiar with the Lib Dems, and cannot see them as something radical or exciting. Then there is the perennial problem of being one of the minor parties, which always struggle to get much media attention between election cycles.But the party is missing some tricks. One former staffer complains that the party, famed for its niceness and for wearing socks with sandals, has failed to position itself in “the angry space” the times demand. Its new slogan – “demand better” – is a start, but the party isn’t nearly strong enough on Brexit: strategists get bogged down in the uncertain technicalities of a second referendum, rather than matching the insouciance of their Brexiteer opponents. They could also do better at marrying their national message with their local ones: making it clear, for example, that it would serve fishermen and farmers to stay in Europe, and pointing out how Brexit might affect the money available to local services.But it is a party’s leader who really decides its fate. Remainers – including the 700,000 people who marched in London last month – are galvanised, and crying out for someone to represent them, but Vince Cable is not the person to do it. He may please the party membership – who agree more with him than they did with Tim Farron or Clegg – but he is not charismatic enough to capture imaginations outside this sphere. His image is that of an ageing fusspot, obsessing over party process while bungling more important matters (unforgivably, Cable and Farron failed to turn up to oppose the government in a key Brexit vote in July that passed with a majority of three). Someone else should lead the party.The trouble is finding them. Emerging talents such as Jo Swinson and Layla Moran have been tipped for the leadership, but party members say they have yet to act on any ambitions they may have: “If they want it,” one says, “they must seize it.” The hope that outside candidates might come forward hasn’t yet yielded much either. The Lib Dems recently announced a rule shake-up so that people other than the party’s 12 MPs could run for leader, but the most keenly anticipated name, Gina Miller quickly ruled it out.Cable, to be fair, doesn’t seem to be standing very firmly in anyone’s way. He may have announced intentions to stay in post until Brexit is “resolved”, but members tell me this is partly because no one else is currently in contention, and he is “trying to create the conditions for someone to come forward”. “He has been quite mature about the fact his job is to pave the way for the next person,” they say, and will probably step down when they emerge. In any case, if he does not, “the knives will be out”. Until this happens, the party is unlikely to take the leap forward it hopes for.The Lib Dems are good at coping in hostile environments. They recovered from their low moments in the 1950s, when they held just six seats they recovered from their “dead parrot” years under Thatcher and they will recover from their current predicament. But now they must show they can cope with an opportunity too. • Martha Gill is a freelance political journalist and former lobby correspondent.

It is more serious still when the BBC does it, and yet worse when the presenter is “the most trusted man in Britain”. But, as his latest interview with the Observer reveals, David Attenborough sticks to his line that fully representing environmental issues is a “turn-off”.His new series, Dynasties, will mention the pressures affecting wildlife, but Attenborough makes it clear that it will play them down. To do otherwise, he suggests, would be “proselytising” and “alarmist”. His series will be “a great relief from the political landscape which otherwise dominates our thoughts”. In light of the astonishing rate of collapse of the animal populations he features, alongside most of the rest of the world’s living systems – and when broadcasting as a whole has disgracefully failed to represent such truths – I don’t think such escapism is appropriate or justifiable.It is not proselytising or alarmist to tell us the raw truth about what is happening to the world, however much it might discomfit us. Nor do I believe that revealing the marvels of nature automatically translates into environmental action, as the executive producer of Dynasties claims. I’ve come to believe it can have the opposite effect.For many years, wildlife film-making has presented a pristine living world. It has created an impression of security and abundance, even in places afflicted by cascading ecological collapse. The cameras reassure us that there are vast tracts of wilderness in which wildlife continues to thrive. They cultivate complacency, not action.You cannot do such a thing passively. Wildlife film-makers I know tell me that the effort to portray what looks like an untouched ecosystem becomes harder every year. They have to choose their camera angles ever more carefully to exclude the evidence of destruction, travel further to find the Edens they depict. They know – and many feel deeply uncomfortable about it – that they are telling a false story, creating a fairytale world that persuades us all is well, in the midst of an existential crisis. While many people, thanks in large part to David Attenborough, are now quite well informed about wildlife, we remain astonishingly ignorant about what is happening to it.What makes Attenborough’s comments particularly odd is that they come just a year after the final episode of his Blue Planet II series triggered a massive effort to reduce plastic pollution. Though the programme made a complete dog’s breakfast of the issue, the response demonstrated a vast public appetite for information about the environmental crisis, and an urgent desire to act on it.Since 1985, when I worked in the department that has made most of his programmes, I have pressed the BBC to reveal environmental realities, often with dismal results. In 1995 I spent several months with a producer, developing a novel and imaginative proposal for an environmental series. The producer returned from his meeting with the channel controller in a state of shock. “He just looked at the title and asked ‘Is this environment?’ I said yes. He said, ‘I’ve spent two years trying to get environment off this fucking channel. Why the fuck are you bringing me environment?’”I later discovered that this response was typical. The controllers weren’t indifferent. They were actively hostile. If you ask me whether the BBC or ExxonMobil has done more to frustrate environmental action in this country, I would say the BBC.We all knew that only one person had the power to break this dam. For decades David Attenborough, a former channel controller widely seen as the living embodiment of the BBC, has been able to make any programme he wants. So where, we kept asking, was he? At last, in 2000, he presented an environmental series: State of the Planet.It was an interesting and watchable series, but it left us with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Only in the last few seconds of the final episode was there a hint that structural forces might be at play: “Real success can only come if there’s a change in our societies, in our economics and in our politics.” But what change? What economics? What politics? He had given us no clues.To make matters worse, it was sandwiched between further programmes of his about the wonders of nature, which created a strong impression of robust planetary health. He might have been describing two different worlds. Six years later he made another environmental series, The Truth About Climate Change. And this, in my view, was a total disaster.It told us nothing about the driving forces behind climate breakdown. The only mention of fossil fuel companies was as part of the solution: “The people who extract fossil fuels like oil and gas have now come up with a way to put carbon dioxide back underground.” Apart from the general “we”, the only distinct force identified as responsible was the “1.3 billion Chinese”. That a large proportion of Chinese emissions are caused by manufacturing goods the west buys was not mentioned. The series immediately triggered a new form of climate denial: I was bombarded with people telling me there was no point in taking action in Britain because the Chinese were killing the planet.If Attenborough’s environmentalism has a coherent theme, it is shifting the blame from powerful forces on to either society in general or the poor and weak. Sometimes it becomes pretty dark. In 2013 he told the  “What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about? They’re about too many people for too little land … We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That’s barmy.”There had not been a famine in Ethiopia for 28 years, and the last one was caused not by an absolute food shortage but by civil war and government policies. His suggestion that food relief is counter-productive suggests he has read nothing on the subject since Thomas Malthus’s essay in 1798. But, cruel and ignorant as these comments were, they were more or less cost-free. By contrast, you do not remain a national treasure by upsetting powerful vested interests: look at the flak the outspoken wildlife and environmental presenter Chris Packham attracts for standing up to the hunting lobby.I have always been entranced by Attenborough’s wildlife programmes, but astonished by his consistent failure to mount a coherent, truthful and effective defence of the living world he loves. His revelation of the wonders of nature has been a great public service. But withholding the knowledge we need to defend it is, I believe, a grave disservice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1fb69ead56ff7bec2bf9e5242c20c3ee12ea57e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b4e214e7497fdd20308b5547bed2536","title":"shakespeare help british muslims excluded","story":"A new interpretation of Othello opens up portrayals of Islam that are absent from TV shows like BodyguardAn Islamic prayer mat and a secret Muslim tragic-hero uttering “Ya Akbar” aren’t typically associated with Shakespeare, but Othello has been given a dramatic twist in a new touring production that illustrates the complexities of identity in modern Britain. A co-production involving English Touring Theatre, Oxford Playhouse and Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory, the play is on tour across the UK including in some of its more deprived areas, such as Oldham and Huddersfield. At a time when fictional portrayals of Muslims often suffer from reductionist stereotypes – as in the BBC’s Bodyguard, which had a Muslim woman as a jihadi terrorist – this new interpretation offers a powerfully nuanced message of belonging, and takes account of the centuries-long history of relations between England and the Muslim world. The Moor of Venice was first produced in 1604, a year after Elizabeth I’s reign ended. She had sought an alliance with the Ottoman empire against Catholic Spain – opening up diplomatic, political, economic and cultural exchange – with ambassadors from Morocco visiting the Elizabethan court. So the play’s timing could not have been pure coincidence. Professor Jerry Brotton, in his book This Orient Isle: Elizabethan England and the Islamic World notes: “This story is part of the heritage of Christians, Muslims and any others who call themselves English.”With attitudes this ambivalent, Shakespeare’s play could feel chillingly prophetic.When the contemporary backdrop is one of rising nationalism and populism, tensions over immigration, struggling religious minorities, and such movements as Black Lives Matter, Othello, from a certain perspective, holds startling parallels. In this new production, Othello is a black Muslim general, hiding his faith to assimilate, and fighting on behalf of the white colonial Christian state whose citizens regard him with conflicting views (“devil” “valiant Moor”). This mirrors the modern notion that even the “good” or “worthy” immigrant can never wholly belong.Then there is Iago, the villain who deceives Othello about his wife Desdemona’s fidelity and brings about a psychological downfall built on paranoia. Read: Iago is the fake news that feeds racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia – infiltrating minds and turning us on our own humanity.The play’s identity politics, cultural assimilation and Muslim dimension are not just concocted to look woke, these themes have been in Shakespeare all along. Richard Twyman, the production’s artistic director, says he was struck by the word “Moor”, which, in Shakespeare’s day, was synonomous with “Muslim”. “It urges you to view the play with a certain lens – it makes us aware of many of the issues we see in society today reflected back to us through Shakespeare’s words.”What is crucial to remember is that the relationship between Islam and Britain, although complex, goes much further back than modern history. How uplifting that Twyman wants Muslims to see themselves in Shakespeare. We can only hope that this unique and arguably more authentic approach to Shakespeare may serve to help Muslims to feel less isolated.Now, as then, there is an urgency for all of us to explore themes of masculinity, power, feminism, misogyny, race, and identity – political, spiritual and cultural. The Othello Project, accompanying the play, proposes to do just that. Supported by Amal, a programme of the Said Foundation, the project documents creative responses to the play from visual artists and spoken word poets, while journalists debate the themes in a series of podcasts that feature local voices in the communities of each toured city.Such artistic reinventions are vital to challenging the prejudices surrounding Muslims or indeed any minority. Othello conveys what it means to be British, what it’s like to carry multiple identities, where society stands and where it might be heading. With more productions like this, making sense of who we really are can be a more exciting, representative and relevant story.•Remona Aly is a journalist and commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/336a1896a27b7c36f2e2b8a42fa27d6ecfc47ff1/0_0_941_567/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fe2b2046674cf2a6132ab62846ba368","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of miniature","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘miniature’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘miniature’.

He called on the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, to dismiss him.Scruton was last week appointed by Brokenshire to chair the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission, an unpaid job on a new body, which aims to promote a design and style of homes that “reflect what communities want”.The Conservative philosopher is a frequent visitor to Hungary and says he has known its nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, since 1987. In 2014, he gave a lecture in the country, which referred to Soros, Judaism and Islam.“Many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish, and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros empire,” Scruton wrote in a lecture entitled The Need for Nations, which is reproduced in Hungarian and English on his website.Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party has run a number of campaigns against the supposed threat to Hungary and Europe posed by Soros. These have accused him of funding a “Soros plan” to erase national identities and increase migration flows to Europe. Last month, an institution Soros helped found, the Central European University, said it would leave the country.Scruton’s lecture acknowledged that antisemitism was a problem in modern Hungary. It read: “Moreover, as the world knows, indigenous antisemitism still plays a part in Hungarian society and politics, and presents an obstacle to the emergence of a shared national loyalty among ethnic Hungarians and Jews.”The lecture, first picked up by the Red Roar website, also argued that the nation-state is a Christian, European construct, which explained why a country such as Pakistan was a “failure”. Focusing on Islam, Scruton wrote: “The same is true of many other countries in which Islam is the dominant faith. Even if such countries do function as states, like Pakistan, they are often failures as nations.”Scruton’s observations about Soros are not isolated. The philosopher used an article in the Daily  in February 2018 to discuss sovereignty and Brexit, and whether leave or remain factions “has the nation at heart”.In the article, he referred to Best for Britain, a pro-remain campaign, which has accepted donations from Soros. It said: “And even if it accepts donations from George Soros, whose behaviour in Hungary, Albania and the Balkan states has been inspired at every stage by a visceral hostility to the national idea, this does not affect the issue.“It is possible that this man, whose currency speculation once almost bankrupted our country, is as devoted to the British national interest as is Gina Miller.”When asked about Scruton’s comments about Soros, the department of communities said: “Due diligence was carried out prior to Sir Roger Scruton’s appointment as chair.”A spokesman added: “Professor Sir Roger Scruton, as a long-standing public intellectual, has strong views on a number of issues. He received a knighthood in 2016 and advised the coalition government on design. “His commitment to driving quality in the built environment is well known and he has published extensively on architecture and place, which makes him an excellent candidate for the unpaid chairmanship of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission.”Scruton did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b18a4a4ef03511401487d7eb57b68e847411114/0_338_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd9a55128536c662442a2bd8efeb678f","title":"the colour photography of vivian maier in pictures","story":"The street life of Chicago and New York, photographed in vivid colour by Vivian Maier over several decades, is featured in a new exhibition at Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York.

Klopp claimed Liverpool lost their “mojo” in the intense atmosphere of the Stadion Rajko Mitic, where a changed team featuring Joel Matip, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge – who was withdrawn at half-time – were easily subdued by Group C’s bottom-placed side. It was Liverpool’s third consecutive away defeat in the Champions League – the club’s worst run at the highest level of European competition since 1979.Asked to explain what went wrong in Belgrade, Klopp replied: “I only have 10 fingers.” He elaborated: “They were aggressive. They were aggressive in the last game as well only then we did better. We made life a bit too easy for Belgrade. That is the main problem. They deserved it with the passion they showed. They gave everything. For us it was not clicking, it was not easy. We never came back into situations. We had the moments, we played good balls in at the right moments, but then we had the ball in the box and could not really finish.

The operation, allegedly called Project Longbow by club insiders, allowed them to save €30m (£26.1m) in marketing income, according to Der Spiegel.The German magazine has promised to focus on City throughout the week and Tuesday’s reports suggest that City understood from an early stage that the FFP rules being introduced by the then Uefa president Michel Platini would affect their chances of becoming one of the biggest clubs in Europe. According to a leaked memo from the club’s CEO, Ferran Soriano, the club decided that they needed to fight financial fair play but “do it in a way that is not visible, or we will be pointed out as the global enemies of football”.Der Spiegel claims one of City’s solutions to circumvent the rules was to launch Project Longbow. In explaining the name, the club’s chief legal adviser, Simon Cliff, allegedly noted in an internal email that the longbow was “the weapon the English used to beat the French at Crécy and Agincourt” – the implication being that Platini, a Frenchman, and his brainchild were the enemy.The scheme is said to have involved a shell company called Fordham Sports Management being set up. Usually clubs pay players for their image rights. In City’s case, however, Fordham Sports Management is alleged to have done so – with City’s Abu Dhabi owner reimbursing Fordham directly to the tune of £11m a year. According to Der Spiegel, the deal was a “closed payment loop”, which allowed Manchester City to hide the expenditure.  has not seen or been able to verify the documents Der Spiegel has used in its reporting.The latest revelations follow on from Monday’s claims that the City owner, Sheikh Mansour, paid large parts of inflated sponsorship deals himself to circumvent FFP rules. In one case, documents from City’s chief financial officer, Jorge Chumillas, appear to show the Abu Dhabi United Group, Mansour’s holding company which also owns City, directly paid £59.5m of Etihad’s annual sponsorship, with only £8m coming from the airline.However, a spokesperson for Etihad has claimed the airline was the real source of the money it paid to City. “The airline’s financial obligations, associated with the partnership of the club and the broader City Football Group, have always been, and remain, the sole liability and responsibility of Etihad Airways,” the club said in a statement to the Press Association.“This is reflected in the airline’s audited accounts. Our partnership with Manchester City and the broader City Football Group continues to deliver important ongoing and accumulative returns on our investments.”Despite City’s denials there have been growing calls for Uefa to investigate possible wrongdoing, including from the Spanish league. On Tuesday a La Liga spokesman told the Times: “Uefa should now take action and apply the rules that exist and any sanctions that are necessary.“Uefa should do its job in terms of enforcing FFP because, as we have said before, both Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are not complying with FFP rules.”City were initially handed a £49m fine for FFP breaches in 2014 but were given back £33.4m of that three years later after meeting the requirements of the sanctions initially imposed on them. Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, was alleged at the weekend to have struck a secret deal with the club when he was at Uefa which meant they avoided a Champions League ban.City have yet to comment on the latest accusations but on Monday they repeated the statement they issued last week, defending their position and referring to “out of context materials purportedly hacked or stolen from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel and associated people”.When asked about the accusations, the manager Pep Guardiola insisted that City had always tried to do things the right way. “We want to follow the rules, but I’m a manager, I don’t know what happened,” he added. “All I know is that we are not the only club to spend a lot of money, if you want to achieve another level that is what you have to do. When I was in Spain and Germany you would always hear that Manchester City was just about money, now I am on the inside I know something different. Everyone here is very professional and they try to do things in the right way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691288c9c2b87bac6731ef510f9fc4db7a7127a1/0_123_3679_2208/master/3679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b03ebe82e985bccd655f4debe394a6d","title":"manchester united paul pogba unaffected losing vice captaincy","story":"• José Mourinho stripped Pogba of role in September• Manager sanguine on eve of Juventus group gamePaul Pogba has claimed being stripped of the Manchester United vice-captaincy by José Mourinho has not affected him and that his relationship with the manager is healthy.Pogba had worn the armband in Antonio Valencia’s absence this season but before the Carabao Cup game against Derby County in late September he was informed by Mourinho he would no longer do so.On Pogba’s return to his previous club, Juventus, for Wednesday’s Champions League match the midfielder played down any suggestion this upset him. “For me, it didn’t affect me. I’m still playing and I’m really happy to play,” he said.“The manager is the one who chooses who is captain. Me, I was the second one after Valencia. Then if he takes the armband from me it doesn’t change anything. I just want to play, perform, that’s my job – to give my best for my team and for everybody, for the fans, for the club. It didn’t really touch me, didn’t affect me. Nothing changed really.”After captaining United to victory over Leicester in the opening Premier League game Pogba stated he was not allowed to say certain things. This was taken to refer to tension with Mourinho and was one example of apparent unrest between them.Mourinho offered a similar response. “There is what the press says and another is what Paul says and another is what I say,” he said. “The press say we have a terrible relationship but some months ago Paul said we have a typical coach and player relationship – I think we have a good relationship between a coach and a football player.”Pogba was the subject of a bid from Barcelona in the summer and there have been suggestions the 25-year-old wants to leave. The midfielder, though, stated he is content at United.“Do I look sad?” he said and then smiled. “No.In the summer, Pogba won football’s highest honour in being part of France’s triumphant World Cup side and when at Juventus he won four Italian championships. Yet United have failed to win the title in the two years since he returned and are already nine points behind Manchester City this time.“But we are still there, still on the way – the season is long and we know we didn’t start the best way but it’s not finished. We’ll see at the end what happens.United are in second place in Group H on four points, five behind Juventus. If they lose at the Allianz Stadium on Wednesday night the Italian club will be confirmed as group winners. Yet Mourinho pointed to how United will still have the second qualification berth in their hands in the last two games – even if they are defeated.“Tomorrow is a big match and is big enough not to think about what next,” he said, in reference to Sunday’s visit to Manchester City. “The match against Juventus is not a crucial match. Independent of the result, our next matches against Young Boys and Valencia are the matches that are going to define if we qualify in the second position or to go to the Europa League.“So this is a match we want to win – we want to compete, we want to play, have to play, and want that very much. The best experiences for teams are against teams that are really at the top and we have that opportunity. But it doesn’t matter what happens here or in Valencia – there are two more matches to play and we can still qualify.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f0857a1156022e4c0cbaaff9a1a1665d607a6ac/0_177_1739_1043/master/1739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21db1749d052daddd1dd3bcc164374a1","title":"mauricio pochettino tottenham psv champions league","story":"Mauricio Pochettino still believes his Tottenham side can qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League after they scraped a vital victory over PSV Eindhoven at Wembley.With Internazionale drawing against Barcelona in the other fixture in Group B, Spurs not only have to beat Inter in three weeks but will almost certainly need to achieve a better result than the Italian club in the final matchday – when Spurs travel to the Camp Nou.“Anything can happen,” said Pochettino. “I think there are two games to play and if we are able to beat Inter we will be with them on seven points with one game to play. We would then be going to Barcelona to try to win the game.Pochettino said he was “so pleased” with his team after they came back to win late on but said that they should heed the warning of once again falling behind in the opening stages. Spurs have conceded early against Barcelona and Liverpool this season, and were 1-0 down before two minutes had been played against PSV.“That was our fourth game in nine days and I am so pleased,” the manager added. “To concede again an early goal gave increased belief to the opponent. We created lots of chances, played well and dominated the game, but we could not score. Their keeper was fantastic but there was also a lack of clinical play in front of goal. In the end the team never gave up and we found our reward.”Regarding the early goal, the manager said: “In the last few games it has happened a lot. But look, Barcelona conceded against Inter in the last minute. In football that can happen. We have to be focused from the beginning, be aggressive, don’t concede goals from corners. It’s important we do not concede a goal as cheap as we did today.”If Spurs are to have a chance of qualifying they will surely have to raise their game.

Unlike many other studies, older teenagers and adult women – who tend to have higher rates of FGM – were not included. The research developed estimates by pooling and comparing FGM data by proportion across countries and regions, using a meta-analysis technique.Nafissatou Diop, coordinator of UNFPA-Unicef joint programme, said it was possible that girls included in the study would still undergo FGM at a later point in their teenage years.“Some girls who have not undergone FGM may not have reached the customary age for cutting and may still be at risk,” said Diop. “The age at which the girls are undergoing FGM changes from ethnic group to ethnic group. In Kenya, for example, the Somali community practice FGM on girls aged three to seven. But in the Maasai community they practice FGM when the girl is a teenager, aged between 12 and 14.”Although global FGM rates are falling, she added, increasing numbers of girls will be living in countries where FGM remains prevalent by 2030.“Because of the demographic trends, the absolute number of girls and women undergoing FGM will continue to increase,” said Diop.The authors also warn that while rates of FGM are falling in many areas, this downwards trend could easily be reversed.“If we think, ‘OK, let’s celebrate,’ and we don’t continue with the same efforts, that may have reverse consequences,” said Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala, the report author and professor of biostatistics at Northumbria University. Risk factors – such as poverty, poor quality education and support for FGM among some religious leaders – continued to persist, he said.The study was based on data collected through demographic health surveys, developed by ICF International, and multiple indicator cluster surveys, which are directed by Unicef. Data ranged from the years 1990 to 2017 for 29 countries across Africa, and two countries in western Asia: Iraq and Yemen.Kandala added that trends varied both within and between countries.The report drew on 90 sets of survey data, covering 208,195 girls. The report did not examine the reasons why FGM rates had fallen, but said it was likely to have been driven by policy changes, national and international investment. National laws banning FGM have been introduced in 22 out of 28 practising African countries, according to the campaign group 28 Too Many.In Somalia, where there is no national legislation expressly criminalising FGM, anti-FGM campaigner Ifrah Ahmed said the practice was still prevalent. “I remember being at a school in Mogadishu asking girls about FGM. All the girls said they were already cut. Just one said she hasn’t yet,” she said, adding the girls were aged between seven and 12 years old.The report concluded that if the goal of eliminating FGM was to be reached, further efforts were urgently needed, including working with religious and community leaders, youth and health workers.“This package of comprehensive intervention could include legislation, advocacy, education and multimedia communication,” the report said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81b920ec58a5ed5d30ea702f9bb6b7fa1af1da4/1088_349_7715_4631/master/7715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f9b19cf2653cbbab116d0e54b84008a","title":"in praise of loud women the joy and power of being noisy and female","story":"My big voice was frowned upon when I was a girl in the 70s. Now, celebrities from Beyoncé to Michelle Obama are helping to tear up the idea of what a woman should sound likeNo one wants to sit next to a loud woman. I know this because someone recently moved the placement card on a dinner table to get away from me. That label – “loud woman” – has never been a compliment, even though some of us may wear it as a badge of honour. Picture a loud woman and she is in Technicolor, with the sound turned up past 11, looking like she is stuck in the 80s: big hair, massive gob, voice like a foghorn, part witch, part harridan, part pub landlady. You definitely don’t want to sit next to her when she has a drink inside her.So, what are we supposed to do with the idea of loud women in our postfeminist age? Where have they all gone? Theresa May seems to maintain her fragile power by being the opposite of loud. Angela Merkel built a 30-year career on being as unnoticeable as possible. The response to Germaine Greer in recent years can be summed up as: “Shut up.” Is it no longer acceptable to be a woman and a noisy, loquacious pain in the arse? After all, the women we now think of as loud usually communicate through performance as larger-than-life versions of themselves: Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lady Gaga.In everyday life, there is still something uncomfortable for a woman about being called loud, because the implication is that a) you don’t care about the people around you (otherwise, why are you making them feel uncomfortable?) and b) you don’t care what other people think about you. To allow yourself to be loud as a woman is to be borderline psychopathic – to switch off your empathy and your emotional intelligence – to love the sound of your own voice, to take up too much space. That is the theory, at least. (“Who do you think you are? Beyoncé?”)The reality, of course, is that the expression: “He is a loud man,” does not exist. Certainly, I have never heard anyone say it. A man may occasionally speak loudly. Traditionally, though, loud is a thing that certain women are, rather than something they do. Loud is a word we attach exclusively to women, often alongside the word “lairy”. Loud is a code that says to women: “Please stop doing that.” This, in turn, has often been a signal for women to turn around and say – almost childishly, but quite understandably: “I’ll take up all the space I want, thanks.”What a loud woman looks like, though, has changed hugely in the past two decades. With Michelle Obama publishing her autobiography, Becoming, next week, it is clear that a new generation of women want to redefine the term. As the former first lady puts it: “I admit it: I am louder than the average human being and I have no fear of speaking my mind. These traits don’t come from the colour of my skin, but from an unwavering belief in my own intelligence.” If you ask women whom they would most like to be as a public speaker, many will say Obama. Her speaking style – controlled passion, warm authority, approachable charisma – is extremely attractive. She is the new kind of loud: the volume is calculated and in tune with the audience.Thanks to digital platforms and social media, there has been a huge shift in the past 20 years in how women communicate and build a platform. Many of the women in the Top 10 chart of most popular TED speakers cannot be defined as loud, although their reach is extraordinary and they have built lucrative careers off the back of it. (To enter this chart, you need a minimum of about 10m views for a speech, so it is a fairly accurate measure of impact.) Brene Brown, a research professor who specialises in social work Susan Cain, an author Susan David, a psychologist Elizabeth Gilbert, who wrote Eat, Pray, Love and Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist, have all featured on this list. They are all speakers who embody the opposite of the fire-and-brimstone public-speaking presence of someone such as Margaret Thatcher. Often their message is about how to have your quiet voice heard in a noisy world. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear that many women we may think of as stereotypically loud are secretly quiet. Take Barbra Streisand, currently punting a new album at the age of 76. She had appalling stage fright for years and would only sing live at charity gigs. Adele? She is the richest UK celebrity aged 30 or under and an extraordinary performer. But she has been so nervous in the past that she has vomited into the front row as a result, she strictly controls her exposure to the stage. There are many recent examples of high-profile women who have decided to change things not by shouting the loudest or by drawing attention to themselves, but by starting initiatives that promote other women: take Reese Witherspoon’s multimedia brand, Hello Sunshine, Jameela Jamil’s “I Weigh” campaign (encouraging people to “weigh” their life achievements) and Sharon Horgan’s production company, Merman.At the recent People’s Vote march in London, at least half of the speakers were women, many of them under 30. They were all impressively accomplished orators, able to play to a crowd of thousands and to the camera at the same time (they were being filmed, so that the video could be relayed). Watching them and soaking up their confidence, it occurred to me that what was impressive was that none of them could be dismissed as loud women. Yet their impact, no matter what your politics, was striking.The difference in their styles, particularly among the younger women, was noticeable. A few held forth almost like spoken-word poets, in the style of Hollie McNish or Kate Tempest, allowing themselves to sound creative and passionate. One – an NHS doctor – spoke with quiet, dignified anger. Another was an old-school union speaker, addressing the crowd exactly as a leader of the NUS would have done in the 70s, complete with Citizen Smith intonation. Their styles were as varied as those of the male speakers. This variation and experimentation among female leaders is something we are only starting to see.Just as the past few years have seen a rise in the body-positive movement and an understanding of the expression “fat shaming” and the extent to which those ideas have been internalised, I wonder if the “loud shaming” of women is finally being recognised. Samuel Johnson’s horrible quote about women and public performance is more than a century old: “A woman’s preaching is like a dog’s walking on his hind legs. It is not done well but you are surprised to find it done at all.” When I was a child in the 70s, it was common for me to be told to be quiet and stop showing off – at home, at school, by adults of all kinds. It was not until I was much older that I realised I was not being loud or showing off – I was just talking. This is not necessarily a woman thing it is only in the past few decades that children have been allowed to be as noisy as they want. Anecdotally, many women will say that they learned from an early age that being loud – whatever this means – was not welcome behaviour.“Whatever this means” is important. Because I think we are redefining what it means to be loud. We are starting to understand that you are not obliged to be loud just because someone has told you not to be. My grandmother was a great role model for me when I was growing up. She could be loud. She ran a corner shop with a rod of iron, spoke her mind, laughed raucously and did not suffer fools gladly. But she also agreed with the old saying: “Empty vessels make the most sound.” Modern feminism has to hit a happy medium between these extremes. Don’t make noise for the sake of it, but don’t shut up either. There is a lot of experimentation to be done in the space between those options. As for the person avoiding me at dinner? Maybe I was just wearing too much perfume.How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking by Viv Groskop is out now (Bantam Press, £12.99).

By  Jake HulyerNot long ago, Rob Wood found himself at Heston Blumenthal’s house, in south-west London, where he was being persuaded to eat a flower. They were supposed to have been discussing the TV chef’s latest project, testing music’s effects on the dining experience, for which he had hired Wood to pick the songs. Instead, he was recounting a recent trip to south-east Asia. The flowers on his kitchen table, he said, were from that same trip: he was trying to capture their flavour for a dish he was developing. Wood smelled the flowers. Blumenthal, increasingly animated, urged him to take a bite he wanted the music to capture and complement the flower’s exotic qualities. Under duress, Wood had a little nibble.Wood is the founder and creative director of Music Concierge, a company that chooses background music for businesses. His clients include iconic fashion brands, such as Harvey Nichols and Mulberry, and luxury London hotels, such as the Connaught and the Savoy. Some clients hire Wood because they want to influence iniduals’ behaviour. When the football club Tottenham Hotspur was looking for music for its new training ground complex, Wood was asked to provide playlists for a holistic programme covering every aspect of Spurs’ players’ psychological and physical wellbeing. Others seek to create a certain atmosphere, such as the restaurant German Gymnasium, for which he sourced particular bell sounds that evoked Mitteleuropean cafe culture. For another client – a late night, alcohol-free burger bar in Kuwait, which delivers food on a conveyor belt – Wood had to conjure the vibe of a 1980s New York block party, choosing early hip-hop by Grandmaster Flash and lesser-known tracks by James Brown.Music, even when you are barely aware of it, can be surprisingly powerful. Over recent decades, researchers have found that it can affect how much time we think has passed while waiting in a queue, how co-operative shoppers are with sales staff, and even how sweet or bitter food tastes. One study found that shoppers’ preference for French or German wine shifted according to which of the respective countries’ traditional music was playing from a nearby set of speakers.The background music industry – also known as music design, music consultancy or something offered as part of a broader package of “experiential design” or “sensory marketing” – is constantly deciding what we hear as we go about our everyday business. The biggest player in the industry, Mood Media, was founded in 2004 and now supplies music to 560,000 locations across the world, from Sainsbury’s to KFC.The core of a music consultant’s work is creating distinct, cohesive musical identities for brands. That can mean allying the brand with a particular heritage, such as the restaurant Dishoom, where food and interiors pay postmodern homage to colonial-era India, and where Wood’s playlist features a genre known as “exotica”, an American-born, 1950s style, which refracts world music influences through a western lens. At other times, it can be finding a fresh angle, such as Kenyan restaurant group Nyama Mama, which caters to a young, cosmopolitan clientele and where, rather than just global, American-dominated pop, artists from Nairobi are also played.One day this summer, Wood and his team were working on music for a new hotel, the Dixon, which is due to open in a converted courthouse near London’s Tower Bridge in December. Wood’s brief was for distinct playlists for different areas: the lobby, the bar, the restaurant and the gym. Aside from the gym, where the music – sprightly, uplifting club tracks – would remain consistent at all hours, the playlists were to be ided into different “day parts”, the choices tailored to either four or five different time periods.In an office in Shoreditch, the hotel manager and its owners, with the creative agency working on the hotel’s branding, walked Wood and his team through every detail of the project: the build materials, the history, the average sum – £23 – they anticipated customers would spend in the restaurant. They spoke about emphasising the culture of the local area, and showed slides that included phrases such as “where your enrichment begins” and “authenticity in every detail”. (Authenticity is a word that comes up often in these kind of meetings.) The hotel would be marketed as “premium four star”, they explained, designed to appeal to “the discerning executive” and affluent millennials.After the meeting, there was a trip to the half-finished building site, where the owners pointed out architectural features and Wood, who stayed mostly quiet, appeared to be looking for clues. Much of Wood’s job involves taking abstract suggestions – a handful of adjectives, a scattering of reference points, a corporate slogan – and turning them into music. No small amount of intuition is also required. It is common, he says, for clients to speak about being bold or creative. Part of his job is working out what they really want, whether he should deliver something that will precisely match expectations or pleasingly upend them.The following month, Wood showed me the sample playlists his team had come up with. The hotel’s bar was to be in the old courtroom itself, a high-ceilinged room with wooden furniture. The aim with the music there, Wood told me, was to create a sense of loftiness without sounding staid. “They want heritage but they don’t want it to be traditional,” he said, playing me a gentle, swinging jazz track. The way he explained his process often seemed imprecise, but so, too, was the effect he was trying to achieve: a refined sense of the past that could not be pinned down to any specific period.For most people, background music means muzak. In the 1920s, George Owen Squier, a former US army officer who went on to earn a doctorate in electrical engineering, developed a new way to transmit audio through wires. His idea led to the creation of a company named Wired Music, which enabled businesses to broadcast music in offices and commercial premises. In 1934, in homage to the wildly successful camera company Kodak, Wired Radio was renamed Muzak.Sonically, muzak set the template for background music that would persist for decades: orchestral instrumentals which referenced classical and, later, popular music. Over time, the name would become a term of derision, synonymous with a kind of dated easy-listening music infuriatingly drifting through every public space. “It’s just a kind of amniotic fluid that surrounds us,” said communications professor Gary Gumpert in a 1990 documentary. “It never startles us, it is never too loud, it is never too silent it’s always there.” It was a balm to sooth awkward silences, gentle encouragement toward a brightened mood. An indication of the popularity it once enjoyed is the radio stations – with names like Easy Listening and Beautiful Music – which brought the format into people’s homes.Although the background music industry has existed for almost a century, it has constantly been reshaped by changes in the way music is distributed. For decades, the industry’s ability to deliver music in a non-stop format was as important to clients as the music itself. Each of the background music companies developed its own technology for distributing the music supplied to businesses. For Muzak, it was the transmission through wires it had patented decades earlier for fellow US-based company 3M, it was a bulky cartridge format, sent through the post and then played through a device also of its own design.In the 1970s, the introduction of affordable multi-deck tape players – compared to the fiddly steps involved in putting on a vinyl record, or unreliable multi-record changers – suddenly made it easy for businesses to choose and play music continuously. “You couldn’t control the market any longer,” recalled Peter Standley, who worked at a major UK background music company, Reditune, during that period.Technology also helped shift the consensus about what background music could be. With cassette players at home and in cars, people became accustomed to listening to whatever they wanted, wherever they were. As early as the late 1960s, companies such as Yesco in the US had started licensing original music from record labels, using the popular songs of the moment, rather than easy listening arrangements which paid reference to them. Over time, this became the norm, including at Muzak, which eventually merged with Yesco. (More recently, Muzak was acquired by Mood Media, and in 2013, its brand name was retired.)By the time the CD was invented, in 1982, background music was becoming more nuanced. The CD was the first digital format for music and, by the late 1990s, it had enabled background music companies to develop digital libraries – before the likes of iTunes in the early 2000s – where tracks could be organised by highly specific filters. “If you wanted nothing but love songs that were slow tempo, sung by women, that had a saxophone solo, we could create a playlist using our database,” said Sean Horton, a former music consultant for PlayNetwork. But that was just a taste of the new world of infinite choice that was to come.There are two main ways psychologists think about the effects that music can have on us. The first is physical. Numerous studies have confirmed our common sense assumption that we often subconsciously match what we are doing to what we hear. In 1985, for instance, one study found that diners chewed at a faster pace when higher-tempo music was played. (Researchers measured this according to the delightfully named metric, bites-per-minute.) Interestingly, they noted, diners did not finish their meals faster, suggesting that they had actually been taking smaller bites.The second approach focuses on the associations that music can trigger and how context, such as the environment we are in, affects those associations. One 1998 study found that diners in a cafeteria were willing to spend more money when classical music was played in the background than when there was no music at all. One explanation, researchers suggested, was that diners associated classical music with quality. (In an indictment of the changed fortunes of easy listening music, it elicited a worse response from diners than silence.) Researchers also use the related concept of “musical fit” to understand why people respond to particular music differently depending on the setting.Wood and his team need to take both of these approaches into account. When the client is a retailer, three words come up time and again: high dwell time. Clients want to keep customers browsing for as long as possible. For one high-end department store, Wood’s job was to calm down a busy, hectic environment. Deploying delicate contemporary classical and “intimate vocals”, he aimed to make the store a more pleasant place to spend time, while also complementing the upmarket feel of the building. Some jobs require the opposite approach, however. Many hotels do not have capacity to seat all of their guests for breakfast, which means they want to turn tables quickly. In those cases, Wood provides a brisk soundtrack, rather than the more sedate, leisurely sounds you might expect.One question all music consultants face is just how unobtrusive their selections should be. It is a choice that is sometimes described as between “foreground” or “background” music. Andreas Liffgarden, of Spotify-backed background music supplier Soundtrack Your Brand, drew an analogy between the foreground approach and the way certain fashion labels refuse to pander to their clientele’s tastes. “You might not like red trousers,” he said, “but I don’t give a fuck about that, because red trousers is in vogue in 2018, right?”For better or worse, most clients are not looking for the musical equivalent of red trousers. Paul Hillyer, head of media at Mood Media’s UK business, described the approach his company often takes as “cradle to grave”, the least offensive to the widest spectrum of people. One of their clients is Fuller’s Brewery, which plays music in most of its 400 or so pubs in the UK. Andrew Durn, whose role at Fuller’s involves liaising with Mood Media, described its sound as being roughly like Radio 2, catering to an older, comfortable crowd. “What we don’t want,” he told me, “is customers walking in, listening to the music and saying: ‘What’s that all about?’”It is the strenuously inoffensive nature of this kind of background music that riles up some of the industry’s fiercest critics. One group, Pipedown, have campaigned “for freedom from unwanted music in public places” since 1992, when its founder, Nigel Rodgers, was spurred to action by a particularly irritating experience in a South Kensington restaurant. “Do you hate unwanted piped background music?” reads the call to arms on the group’s website. “Do you detest the way you can’t escape it? (in pubs, restaurants and hotels on the plane, train or bus down the phone ruining decent television programmes adding to the overall levels of noise pollution in public places).” The group, which counts Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley among its celebrity supporters, claims some credit for the decision Marks \u0026amp Spencer took in 2016 to stop using music in its stores. “You’re not going for a special sort of atmosphere, you’re just going to do your shopping,” Rodgers said.One of Pipedown’s boldest claims is that there is “no genuine evidence” that background music increases sales. Opinions vary on this question, although most experts do not share Pipedown’s hardline position. Adrian North, a psychology professor at Curtin University in Perth, argues that small purchases are where it is most possible to influence consumers. He conducted the 1997 study that found that shoppers were more likely to choose either French or German wine, depending on which of the respective countries’ music they heard, something he contrasted with a decision like buying a car. “I would be astonished,” he said, “if someone chose a Renault over a Volkswagen just because you play French music in a showroom.”Others argue that it makes more sense to think about the influence of background music in terms of subtle, long-term benefits, rather than immediate impact on sales. Rhonda Hadi, marketing professor at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, believes companies that provide an experience, such as flights or accommodation, can reap the greatest rewards. “The service itself is so intangible,” she said, “that people rely on any cues they can to gauge the quality of the service that they’ve received.”Hadi says that consumers value this holistic approach more than they used to. Younger consumers, she said, tend to value authenticity, which the marketing industry interprets as a preference for “congruence”, the idea that everything should fit with the brand and the story they tell about themselves. While it might not alter someone’s decision about which car to buy, the right music, in a particular car showroom, might coalesce with a package of other details to make someone feel good about the hefty sum of money they are about to part with.One afternoon in July, two Music Concierge staff – music consultant Damon Martin and account manager Morgan Mackintosh – visited Mulberry’s Kensington office. They were there to present a sample set of playlists for the redesign of the British brand’s flagship Regent Street store. Around the table were Baron Osuna, Mulberry’s head of image, and Bradley Taylor, head of visual merchandising and store design. Mackintosh turned her laptop around to display a PowerPoint presentation, which she clicked through as Martin talked.Music Concierge’s brief had been to find music that would match the concept for the store’s new design, “British Brutalism”, as well as Mulberry’s “brand pillars”: Britishness quality lifestyle accessibility real. The plans for the store involved concrete structures planted in the centre of the shop, along with glazed green tiles and Windsor chairs. Phrases used to describe the new design included “British nature”, “decorative gestures”, and “honest materials”.One of the steers from Mulberry was that it wanted the stores to feel more like a gallery space. In the past, Mulberry had signalled “Britishness” in its stores by playing artists such as the Cure and Joy Division, but for this new design, Martin suggested slightly more avant-garde British artists, such as Brian Eno and Four Tet. (Speaking in a nearby cafe afterwards, Martin recalled different versions of “Britishness” he had come up with for other clients, like Noël Coward for a heritage hotel, or young guitar bands for a high street retailer.)A song by Digitonal, downbeat and electronic, played tinnily from Martin’s portable speakers. “It’s on the softer side,” he said, “but it has a sense of drama and it builds.” Taylor and Osuna listened, nodded, and offered occasional comments. “It might feel a bit sombre,” Osuna said. “I think we could approach the warmth through playfulness,” replied Martin, picking out a song by Russian artist Kate NV. Ascribing it to “real”, the final brand pillar, he said, “There’s a sort of eccentricity to it that offers a sense of lightness.”The songs presented to Mulberry were intended to convey how the full playlists would sound. Once a client is satisfied with Music Concierge’s concept, the team at the office adds flesh to the bones: the playlist designers, who are junior to the music consultants, search through their internal music libraries to find songs that will make up the playlists’ full length, which can number between 1,000 and 8,000. The number mostly depends on how many different sections the client wants to ide their playlist into, and the number of different areas at the location. The cost, per site, can range from about £35 to £250 a month.Companies like Music Concierge have capitalised on the sweeping changes to the world of retail in recent years. In the face of competition from online retailers, many high-street businesses have sought to repackage shops as a “destination”: no longer just a functional place to buy things, they are presented as an experience. The idea of experiential marketing has also taken hold. The business academics Bernd Schmitt and Alex Simonson captured this idea in a prescient book published in 1997: “In a world in which most consumers have their basic needs satisfied,” they wrote, “value is easily provided by satisfying customers’ experiential needs – their aesthetic needs.” Martin Lindstrom’s influential 2005 book, Brand Sense, built upon these ideas, hailing the marketing power of sound and scent. He cited Play-Doh, Crayola and Johnson’s Baby Powder as the brands with the most recognisable smells. Underscoring music’s role in conjuring positive associations, he wrote: “Music makes new memories, evokes the past, and instantaneously can transport you to another place.”Music Concierge was one of several companies set up in the mid-to-late 2000s, responding to these trends, and in particular a greater commercial appetite for music carefully tailored to particular brands. Rob Wood, like many of these companies’ founders and employees, had jumped ship from the music and media industries. His trajectory is something of a parable for the way the music industry has had to transform itself – both economically and culturally – in response to the changes wrought by technology.After graduating from university in the early 1990s, Wood spent a few years DJing and running an arts listings magazine, eventually going on to become editor of the alternative music magazine Jockey Slut in 1999. But, as the internet began to eat away at the magazine industry’s circulation figures and advertising revenues, Wood ended up working for an online booking portal for luxury hotels. Reviewing hotels for them, he noticed how often establishments would be playing music that seemed jarring. “They were just putting on what I’d call Cafe del Bula Bar,” he told me. “Cliched music, which wasn’t appropriate to a boutique hotel in the Cotswolds.”At just the time that the digital revolution was shaking up the music and media industries, businesses were increasingly seeking the skillset that Wood possessed. After a few years of ad-hoc consultancy, in 2007 he founded Music Concierge. Wood is sanguine about his role in pulling music away from the alternative enclaves where he first discovered it. As the music business has tanked, for many the notion of “selling out” has come to seem dated. Selling rights for songs to be used in adverts, TV, videogames, films and public spaces now accounts for a much greater slice of music industry profits. Any artist still reticent about licensing their music may be persuaded to do so by the promise that it will be used in a more sophisticated, artful way than ever before – a change Wood has played a part in: his job, after all, is scuffing the line between commerce and culture. “I’m doing something I’ve always done,” he said. “I’ve always been driven by introducing people to music they didn’t know they might love.”Just as it always has, the future of Wood’s industry will depend on how well it can adapt to the pace of change. Since Spotify was founded in 2008, digital sales of music have collapsed, and streaming – on Spotify and its competitors Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer, Pandora and more – has become the way most people listen to music. Everyone can now instantly access most of the world’s recorded music online.For background music companies, streaming is both a threat and an opportunity. On the one hand, music has become easier to access and distribute, meaning that companies like Music Concierge can select, deliver and tweak the music they deliver to businesses with greater speed, flexibility and precision than ever before. On the other hand, everyone now has access to vast music libraries that were once the preserve of a tiny number of hardcore music nerds and people working in the industry. “It went from us being the boutique music expert to having more of a collaboration with the brand,” said Sean Horton, who worked as a music consultant at PlayNetwork for over a decade. “Streaming turned everyone into a music expert.”Behind the rise of streaming lurks the spectre of automation. One part of Spotify’s appeal is its playlists, where it offers music for particular activities, as well as inidualised recommendations. The latter relies on comparing your choices with those of millions of other users, combined with analyses of the raw properties of songs, such as key, mode and tempo. For many people I spoke to while reporting this piece, the algorithms used to provide these recommendations seemed to be a source of anxiety. At the bigger companies, in particular, staff were keen to stress the importance of the real-life curator. Richard Hampson at Imagesound emphasised the intuitive side to his job. “It’s always been about feel and human touch,” he argued. “Human taste is really important, and the algorithm thing is removing that.”During my visit to his office in July, Wood showed me a playlist he was working on for Gravetye Manor, a hotel we had visited the previous month. Compared to many of his other projects, this one was a minor undertaking: it was for a bar that seats about 20 people. The hotel had just sent some feedback that the music for the evening sounded a little too muted, and he had some ideas for livening it up. He clicked through his laptop, pondering each of the songs’ qualities, teasing out how they might fit together. “A bit of Britishness,” he said, enthusiastically, picking a track by Richard Hawley as well as a Marvin Gaye track, “to balance it out with a bit of familiarity”. A Shirley Bassey cover of the Doors, her voice crooning out of the laptop speakers was, he explained, “a way of testing the boundary”. He paused to listen for a moment, pleased with the choice.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d333868df3256845f50b6fd7139bb3202537d4ca/0_107_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3856dbfd9dc55e4243f2e5ca706f061e","title":"inside the campaign to stop brexit podcast","story":"As Brexit negotiations gear up again this week, the campaign for a second referendum is gathering momentum.

Whether you voted leave or remain, nobody voted for the purgatory of permanent negotiations,” he said.He points out that May and her Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, have suggested that the deal will be “detailed, precise and substantive”.“That is exactly what Labour expects and what I will be discussing in Brussels. If the final deal is anything less than the government has promised, Labour will not support it,” he said.Brussels has long made clear that the political declaration will not be legally binding – unlike the withdrawal agreement, containing the £30bn-plus financial settlement and the backstop – and could be open to renegotiation by a future government.Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said it had long been obvious that the political declaration would not be a detailed document because of the EU’s insistence that it cannot negotiate the details of a new trading relationship with an existing member.“A blind Brexit is inherent in Brexit. It’s inevitable,” he said. “The two negotiations will take place under a different process, with different people – if you’re anti-blind Brexit, you’re anti-Brexit.”Starmer and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have been meeting Labour MPs inidually to discuss the pros and cons of the government’s likely deal and their party’s strategy when parliament votes on it.Their hand was strengthened on Tuesday by the results of a consultation with Momentum members, which showed that they overwhelmingly want Labour MPs to vote down May’s Brexit deal. Many are hoping that they will also throw their weight behind a second referendum.The grassroots campaign group asked its members their views on Brexit after Labour’s conference in Liverpool agreed a motion calling for the party to push for a general election and, failing that, a referendum.Some Labour MPs who represent Brexit-backing constituencies, including Caroline Flint and Gareth Snell, have suggested that they could support the deal, rather than risk a damaging no-deal exit from the European Union next March.Labour plans to table a no-confidence vote in the government within days if May’s deal is rejected by parliament.Becky Boumelha, a spokeswoman for Momentum, said: “Propping up a destructive Tory deal will be kryptonite to Labour members and any Labour MP who votes with the government will have a hard time explaining themselves back in their constituencies.”Momentum was set up to back Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, but its members’ enthusiasm for rejecting Brexit contrasts with the more cautious approach of the Labour leader and his shadow cabinet, who have repeatedly insisted that they respect the result of the 2016 referendum.Backers of another referendum seized on the survey results. David Lammy, MP for Tottenham and member of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “It’s great news that Momentum will be campaigning for Labour MPs to oppose this miserable Brexit. Labour voters and Labour MPs should unite against a bad Brexit and work to give people the democratic voice they deserve.”Brandon Lewis MP, the Conservative party chairman, said: “Labour have spent the last two years doing everything they possibly can to frustrate the Brexit process. They promised to respect the referendum, but voted against the EU Withdrawal Act and now want to rerun the referendum, tearing up their pledge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1219ffff41a2d4dfc0dfb9107aca351d9553228/0_145_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d4934252f56542130cae859ce9930f","title":"leaked plan to sell brexit deal measured success is the narrative","story":"No 10 distances itself from optimistic plan, which predicts endorsements by world leadersAs a PR plan it is certainly ambitious, featuring endorsements from world leaders and an interview with Theresa May by David Dimbleby. However, Downing Street insists a leaked “communications grid” supposedly intended to sell a Brexit strategy does not reflect its thinking.Details of the plan, seen by the  among others, lay out an apparent timetable for the month, from a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to a House of Commons vote on the deal it says will take place on 27 November.The days between are filled with a list of media events and supportive statements, beginning with a triumphant announcement from the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, that the cabinet has agreed a deal.“The narrative is going to be measured success, that this is good for everyone, but won’t be all champagne corks popping,” the leaked note says.Among later events in the schedule are a speech by May to the CBI conference, which the leaked planner says would argue the agreement “brings the country back together, now is the time for us all to unite behind it for the good of all our futures etc”.On the same day, the withdrawal agreement and outline deal on a future relationship with the EU would be put to parliament, with an unnamed set of junior ministers tasked with “doing regional media all day”.The rest of the time before the Commons vote is filled with themed days, including a UK-wide sales pitch, which would see May visit “the north andor Scotland”, and another day devoted to the economy.Other days would cover immigration, the NHS and Northern Ireland. The entry for the latter says the aim would be for May to visit Northern Ireland and try to get the support of the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, which the memo misspells as “Varadker”.A final flurry of efforts would see May supposedly doing an interview with Dimbleby.A Downing Street source was quick to distance itself from the leaked plan. “The misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesn’t represent the government’s thinking.

But now research has confirmed that the Gauls did not merely sever the heads of their foes, they appear to have embalmed them to boot.Experts say they have found traces of conifer resins on the remains of skulls discovered at the iron age settlement of Le Cailar in the south of France – a discovery they say backs up ancient reports that the Celtic Gauls preserved their grisly trophies.Previous finds at other sites have included a sculpture of a mounted warrior, not only with sword and spear but a head slung around the neck of the horse, while the gruesome practice is also noted in a number of ancient texts, and supported by discoveries of human skulls with marks of decapitation, and even nails inside them.However, whether the Gauls did indeed embalm the severed heads was less clear.Writing in the Journal of Archaeological Science, Roure and colleagues describe how they analysed human skulls found with weapons in an area of Le Cailar where they would have been widely visible – suggesting they would have been on display. The team took samples from 11 human skull fragments, noting many of the skulls showed cut marks of decapitation and signs that hint at the removal of the brain. They also tested five bones from animals found in the same area.The analysis revealed traces of a host of substances on the human fragments, including fatty acids and cholesterol, much of which the team say are characteristic of degraded human, plant or animal fats. The animal bones also showed traces of cholesterol.However the team found that six of the eleven human skull fragments bore traces of substances called diterpenoids – telltale signs that the bones had been in contact with conifer resin. Such traces were not found on the animal bones.The researchers say the findings add weight to ancient reports that, after severing the heads of their enemies, Celtic tribes embalmed them – pointing to ancient Greek writers Strabo and Diodorus of Sicily who both record that a Greek called Poseidonios claimed to have seen such sights in Gaul. While these texts note that cedar oil was used, the team say it might have been a resin with a similar smell, as it is not clear if cedar trees were growing in the area in the third century BC.Roure said the purpose of the preservation might have been to make sure the face and features of the enemy remained on show. “The ancient texts said only the most powerful enemies and the most important enemies were embalmed – maybe that was to be able to say ‘see that face, it was some big warrior’,” she said. She added the texts also said that the Gauls never gave back such heads “even for an equal weight of gold”. “We think that means sometimes some people tried to buy the heads,” said Roure.The authors say it is not clear exactly how the embalming process was carried out, but that the heads might have been dipped in the resin, or it could have been poured over them, and might have been applied more than once as time went on. It is also unclear whether the process was also carried out on revered locals, or was reserved solely for enemies.Dr Rachel Pope, an expert in European prehistory at the University of Liverpool who was not involved in the study, said the research was exciting.“We knew from statues that the display of human heads was popular in Mediterranean France – akin to a broader tradition at this time involving the display of weapons. The evidence now, from this site, is that human heads were indeed embalmed,” she said. “Now we have the science that supports earlier archaeology, as well as a greater understanding of where the classical texts and the archaeology meet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc487dfc4b1ae6d27ad443170aeeb18aef77255c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f290d31985bfdbef8b318e14816d589","title":"tell us has your company adopted a living wage policy","story":"We want to hear from readers working for companies paying Living Wage Foundation rates as an increase is announcedStaff of some 4,700 employers who have adopted a voluntary living wage policy are in line for an inflation-beating pay rise.The foundation’s figures are £1.17 higher an hour than the national living wage imposed by the government for workers over the age of 25.

Having left New Zealand provincial rugby last summer to chase his dream of playing for England, the 27-year-old knows the All Blacks rather better than he does his new teammates and facing the haka at Twickenham will be almost like gazing into a mirror.If anything, it is his former Hurricanes teammates such as Beauden Barrett and Ardie Savea who will feel even more disconcerted. Shields was their Super Rugby captain until recently now, according to Ben Youngs, he is ulging their trade secrets.“Brad’s knowledge is really important because he was at the Hurricanes,” said Youngs. “He can tell us what the guys he has played with don’t particularly like and the traits they have in their game. We don’t just want to contain the All Blacks, we want to throw our gameplan at them.”Among the nuggets of information England have absorbed is that Barrett carries the ball more than anyone else in the All Black team. “I didn’t know that until this week,” said Youngs. “It’s an amazing stat.”Inside the All Blacks dressing room not everyone sounds so thrilled. “It is a bit funny,” said the lock Brodie Retallick. “He was running around for the Hurricanes and the next minute he’s playing for England.”The hooker, Codie Taylor, suspects a few words will be exchanged. “Maybe between the Hurricanes boys there might be a bit of stick. Maybe he’ll have something to say to his buddies out there.”Should England beat the All Blacks on Saturday, however, Steve Hansen and his assistants will inevitably find themselves being asked why they collectively allowed the New Zealand-reared flanker to slip away.Hansen’s assistant, Ian Foster, has already given a pretty honest assessment. “I guess the obvious answer is the selectors didn’t pick him. When you’re selecting a national team, there’s a whole lot of good players that don’t quite make it. I’m not going to give you reasons why we didn’t pick him. But what we do know is that he is a quality person, he did a great job off the field at the Hurricanes and he was in the conversation a lot with us.”Having represented the All Blacks at under-20 level, made his provincial debut as a teenager and recorded a century of appearances for the Hurricanes, Shields was on the verge of All Blacks tour selection last year but, ultimately, chose to move to Wasps and made a rapid England Test debut in South Africa in June on the basis of his parents’ nationality. Before he departed New Zealand he left England shirts in the drawers of Barrett and Dane Coles as a parting gift, which may or may not have been a wise move.“I think we’ve got over the stage of seeing him in a white jersey now,” said Foster. “He’s just a loosey who plays for England.”With Tom Curry ruled out for the remainder of the autumn series after damaging an ankle in Saturday’s 12‑11 win over South Africa – Bath’s Sam Underhill has replaced him in the 25-man squad for this weekend – Shields looks certain to feature in some capacity. If so, he already has a fair idea how it might feel. “What’s the old saying: ‘Enemies on the field and best friends after the game?’ That’s my mentality.“I played with a few of the guys for a number of years so there are friendships and relationships there but you’re out on the field to do a job.“I don’t think it’s about proving a point. As soon as you start to overthink things, that will affect the performance of the team. I’ll do my best for the squad and try to put my best foot forward, otherwise you’ll look like a bit of a sham out there. You’ve got to perform or you’re no good to anyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671e6857879a00840b04fb166299cd55b4416a53/0_40_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bf999930a736f1d229b97cc73c31939","title":"sri lanka v england first test day two live cricket","story":"26th over: Sri Lanka 55-4 (Mathews 11, Chandimal 6) Leach turns a peach past Mathews’ defensive push.

Rumour even had it that some kit was left by a young Graham Gooch (local Ilford club man making good). “For the record, my Dad bought me my first thigh pad with the proceeds of a Man of the Match award from Havering District under-13s for a plucky but ultimately forlorn carrying-the-bat action. Unfortunately Dad saw fit to leave it unannounced in my bag in an unlocked away changing room. As an honest youth, I promptly removed foreign paper bag and contents (unexamined) on my return from fielding, as it was clearly nothing to do with me and no-one else in the team claimed knowledge. Cue considerable consternation on my return home that evening when eventually prompted about the suitability of new prized item. Tears and recriminations before bedtime. Film buffs will have already guessed that I named that (subsequently recovered) thigh pad, ‘Rosebud’.”That’s the cleverest name I’ve heard since Project Longbow.21st over: Sri Lanka 46-4 (Mathews 6, Chandimal 2) Chandimal is beaten by Moeen. His injury means Sri Lanka can only walk singles, which won’t help to alleviate the pressure. Quite the predicament they’re in here. “Hi Rob,” says Tim Maitland. “Wouldn’t a group of wicketkeepers be called something more like a ‘nice-one-nice-one-I-like-that of wicketkeepers’?”Ah yes, or a baaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhlingwarney of keepers. Or a rightundernassersnose of glovemen.20th over: Sri Lanka 43-4 (Mathews 4, Chandimal 1) Jack Leach starts after lunch to Angelo Mathews. Nothing happens, and life goes on.“Morning Rob,” says Harry Mann. “Walking the halls of the excellent St George’s hospital, Tooting after the birth of my daughter Tilly yesterday has given me ample opportunity to keep abreast of goings-on in Galle. This new upstart Foakes seems to be playing without the pressure or hindrances of recent first timers - is this good management, good talent or something else? If the former, what’s changed and if the latter, where has he been for the past year or so? Either way it’s an encouraging start - and given me something to read whilst awaiting the opening of the M\u0026ampS coffee shop - many thanks.”Congratulations, Harry! England have been keen to get Foakes in for a while there just hasn’t been a vacancy. As for nervous starters, the odd thing is that a lot of players have started well (Lyth and Robson, for eg, made centuries in their second Test, Jennings in his first) before fading in their second series.There are so many variables in this side that it’s unwise to assume too much, but it’s not hard to imagine a scenario in which Foakes is locked in at No7 for the next few years. The tempo of his batting is just what England need. But there will be pressure on him if his average drops below, say, 35. It’s all a bit nobodyknowsanything.“Hello Rob,” says Zaph Mann. “Commiserations on the unholy time to be up typing. For once being in Oregon is handy timing at least for the first two sessions. Given the thrashings you mention I was wondering if this is a one-off because:“1) It’s rainy and overcast - English conditions?2) England seem to win and then lose and then winlose often.” I’m all for accentuating the negative but I’m not sure there is one here. The pitch conditions are still Sri Lankan and the ball hasn’t swung any more than usual. And this would be England’s first away win in 14 games: the WLWL pattern only really applies at home. They haven’t suddenly found a formula to rule the entire known universe, but it would be a really good win.No need for the commiserations, by the way. In the parlance of our time, I bloody love it. 19th over: Sri Lanka 42-4 (Mathews 3, Chandimal 1) Moeen continues to Chandimal, who is definitely struggling with his groin. Mathews wanted to take a quick single off the second ball, at which point Chandimal sent him back with a decisive bark. A maiden from Moeen completes a spectacular opening session for England.Ben Foakes made a century on debut and then England’s first four bowlers took a wicket apiece to put them in complete control of the match. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session!“Night night, Rob,” says John Leavey, who may or may be in a state of progessively unrewarding inebriation.18th over: Sri Lanka 42-4 (Mathews 3, Chandimal 1) I can’t believe I’m saying this before lunch on day two, but it’s getting hard to see any other result than an England victory. And if they do win, we shouldn’t underestimate what an immense result it would be. Australia and South Africa were completely thrashed in Sri Lanka.Chandimal walks a single off Leach. He hasn’t yet needed to break into a jog. But given Mathews’ run-out problems, it could be an interesting partnership.17th over: Sri Lanka 40-4 (Mathews 2, Chandimal 0) The new batsman is the captain Dinesh Chandimal, batting down the order because he was off the field with a groin problem. We’ll soon see whether he’s able to run.It’s spin at both ends, with Moeen Ali replacing Sam Curran - and he strikes third ball! Dhananjaya premeditates a lap stroke, misses and is bowled middle stump. That’s an abysmal shot in the circumstances, very similar to Stokes’s at the same stage yesterday. England were in trouble then. Sri Lanka are breast-deep in the malodorous stuff now.16th over: Sri Lanka 38-3 (Dhananjaya 12, Mathews 2) Another good over from Leach yields just a single. Repetition is the key to so much of his success, and he is in a nice groove here. “Thigh-pads at schoolboy cricket level (14th over)?” sniffs John Starbuck. “There’s posh!” He didn’t say what they were made of, in fairness. In my head, I have an image o- no, let’s not.15th over: Sri Lanka 37-3 (Dhananjaya 11, Mathews 2) Angelo Mathews has plenty to prove after that weird shemozzle before the ODIs. He’s still a brilliant player, perhaps Sri Lanka’s best, and England would love to get rid of him before he gets his eye in. He plays a couple of confident drives off Curran without piercing the field. A maiden. This has been a good second spell from Curran, 3-1-2-0 I think.“For those seeking online commentary there’s always Guerilla Cricket,” says Phil Withall, “where you can sometimes catch Gary Naylor (OBO stalwart) commentating.”Stalwart? Stalwart?! He’s the Garry Sobers of the OBO!14th over: Sri Lanka 37-3 (Dhananjaya 11, Mathews 2) Leach has got his pace just right now, around 50mph. It wouldn’t be a surprise if he ended up as Man of the Match in this game. Root is fielding on his knees at gully, literally, for the new batsman Mathews.“I’d quite forgotten about the unfounded accusation against John Lever’s magnificent performances on his India tour (6th over),” says Brian Withington. “Nice guy, too - occasionally supervised our winter nets in the early 70s at Bill Morris’s celebrated indoor cricket school behind the Beehive Pub in Ilford. Considerably more laid back than Stuart Turner, who could be a bit, erm, enthusiastic off just a one-pace run-up. Rather shocking for a schoolboy, in fact, considering he was considered no more than a busy trundler off his full run. The memory is somewhat sharpened by recall of the aroma of lost and discarded thigh pads and other protective changing room flotsam and jetsam ...”Beautifully done by Jack Leach. That’s a craftsman at work. He was building pressure through relentless accuracy and now he has taken his first wicket. The line and length were perfect and the ball turned just enough to find the edge as Mendis pushed forward defensively. Stokes took a smart low catch at slip.13th over: Sri Lanka 34-2 (Dhananjaya 10, Mendis 19) Curran angles a good delivery past the edge of Mendis. For a while it looked like Sri Lanka wanted to counter-attack, but since the introduction of Leach they have been forced back. The last six overs have brought only four runs.“A bellowing of wicketkeepers?” says Ian Forth. “Good enough for bullfinches.”12th over: Sri Lanka 33-2 (Dhananjaya 10, Mendis 18) Leach hasn’t turned it yet, that first ball aside, but he’s building pressure with his accuracy. Another maiden gives him figures of 3-2-1-0. 11th over: Sri Lanka 33-2 (Dhananjaya 10, Mendis 18) Five overs is a lot in this heat, even for Jimmy Anderson, so he is replaced by Sam Curran. Dhananjaya, who has calmed down after a busy start, pulls a short ball for a single in an otherwise uneventful over. I say ‘otherwise’ pulling a single isn’t exactly the event of the year. Look, cut me some slack, it’s 5.57am.10th over: Sri Lanka 32-2 (Dhananjaya 9, Mendis 18) A maiden from Leach, who has started with his usual accuracy, to Mendis. I reckon he could drop the pace a touch - hey man, slow down - but it’s been an encouraging start. 9th over: Sri Lanka 32-2 (Dhananjaya 9, Mendis 18) Anderson is moving the ball back into the right-handers, both in the air and off the pitch, and draws an inside-edge from Dhananjaya. It’s been a really good spell from Anderson. With his fitness, skill and enthusiasm, he is a disgrace to the average 36-year-old man.“In response to George’s request for TMS overseas link - I don’t think TMS have got the rights,” says Bob Moule. “Radio commentary is on Talksport2. I dunno about Norway, but the easiest way to get Talksport2 in Malaysia is to go via the Talksport webpage.”Ach, of course. I didn’t spend long enough with my head in the Nespresso this morning, sorry. It is indeed on Talksport. 8th over: Sri Lanka 31-2 (Dhananjaya 9, Mendis 17) Jack Leach replaces Sam Curran, who did his job with a spell of 3-0-14-1. Two things to look out for here: the new ball did a lot for the spinners yesterday, and Perera in particular got more from the pitch when he bowled it slower. Leach’s first ball is a jaffa, tossed up and gripping enough to beat Mendis’s defensive push. He is used to bowling on helpful pitches at TauntonCiderabad and has the capacity to be a matchwinner in these conditions. An excellent start.“Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Mike Atherton on Sky has just been musing at a collective noun for wicket keepers in view of England’s current riches, and preferred an ‘irritation’. My first thought was that a ‘clutch’ of keepers might be more appropriate, although I suppose a ‘quandary’ might also fit the bill?” In the current circumstances, how about a confusion?7th over: Sri Lanka 30-2 (Dhananjaya 9, Mendis 16) Sri Lanka are keen to counter-attack, Mendis in particular. Anderson, despite bowling expertly, has been relatively expensive: 4-0-16-1. Mind you, at least half those runs came off the edge.“Morning, Rob,” says John Starbuck. “Karunaratne’s review indicates two things: one, he genuinely didn’t feel the nick and two, everybody needs more education and training on what the DRS is really for. Oh, and what about Lakmal’s five-for - worth a mention at least?”He only got three-for, didn’t he?6th over: Sri Lanka 28-2 (Dhananjaya 7, Mendis 16) Mendis drives consecutive deliveries from Curran for four, the first through midwicket and the second through mid-off. Those were majestic strokes.“Sam Curran reminds me a lot of another blond swinger, John Lever,” says Gary Naylor. “He took 37 wickets at 20 in India, so a bit of movement in with the odd one holding its line might be handy.”And a tub of Vaseline. (Allegedly.) 5th over: Sri Lanka 19-2 (Dhananjaya 6, Mendis 8) Mendis is beaten, feeling for a beauty just outside off stump, and then edges at catchable height for four. There’s a gap between second and third slip, and the ball went straight through it. Ach! Anderson is making the batsmen play more than is often the case with the new ball, an acknowledgement of the conditions. It’s been an emphatic start with the ball from England.“Will ‘Smyth calls Galle’ become one of those things that people wait for every time there’s a test played there?” says Phil Withall. “Can we expect Peter Snow levels of enthusiasm and hyperbole in the future?”Bloody hell though, I’d love to be Peter Snow for a day. Now that’s what I call a man.4th over: Sri Lanka 14-2 (Dhananjaya 5, Mendis 4) I don’t know how to break this to you, but England are now in serious danger of winning an overseas Test for the first time since 2016. Their performance since lunch yesterday has been admirable, and they almost get a third wicket when the new batsman Kusal Mendis edges Curran wide of the slips for four.“Top of the morning Rob,” says George Murphy. “A fine morning in Southern Norway compounded by Foakes’ debut ton. As much as I enjoy OBO it is reasonably difficult to keep up to date whilst pottering about on the scaffold in front of Stavanger cathedral. Despite my Cornish Heritage, I lack a third arm to refresh the thread whilst also maneuvering a hammer and chisel. Any chance for the TMS YouTube link? Standard searches only seem to produce old posts not the live link.”Can anyone help? I would look it up myself but I’ve blocked Twitter on my computer as a goodwill gesture to my sanity.That’s why England gave Sam Curran the new ball! Kaushal Silva has gone, plumb LBW to the inswinger. It was beautifully bowled by Curran, a textbook dismissal for a left-arm swing bowler to a right-handed batsman.3rd over: Sri Lanka 10-1 (Silva 1, Dhananjaya 5) Dhananjaya tries to cut a lifting nipbacker from Anderson and so nearly drags it onto the stumps. This has been a superb start from Anderson, who recognises the importance of the new ball in these conditions.“At the risk of being an incorrigible ne’er-do-well curmudgeon, may I express some slight disappointment that Ben Foakes stopped channelling his inner Cook as soon as he reached his well-deserved century?” says Brian Withington. “I hope Jimmy didn’t feel too slighted by the lack of faith shown in his willow yielding staying powers. Glad I got that off my chest.”I think the four balls Jimmy faced - two edges, one strangled LBW appeal - probably reinforced Foakes’ clarity.2nd over: Sri Lanka 8-1 (Silva 0, Dhananjaya 4) There was a suggestion England might open with Jack Leach, but the ball swung enough in that Anderson over to justify the use of Sam Curran. He too gets a soupcon of swing to the right-handers, though it’s nothing they can’t handle. One from the over.“Why,” says John Leavey, “are there two TVs in my lounge?” 1st over: Sri Lanka 7-1 (Silva 0, Dhananjaya 3) The new batsman Dhananjaya inside-edges Anderson for a single. This has been some start for England. On Sky, Mike Atherton highlights England’s new, post-Cook cordon: Root at first slip, then Stokes, Burns and Buttler. “Well, less than mid-term cricket prediction?” asks Bill Hargreaves. “Will this score hold water? (Chucking it down here in Dublin.)”Yep, I think England will win from here. I’ll bloody well say it: IT’S COMING HOME.Anderson strikes second ball - but Karunaratne has reviewed it straight away! It was a tempting back-of-a-length outswinger which Karunaratne followed outside off stump, and England were certain he nicked it through to Ben Foakes. And that’s why they were certain: Ultra-Edge shows he did get a thin edge. Why the bloody blazes did he review that?Foakes falls to the last ball of the over, trying to get as many quick runs as possible. He sliced Lakmal high towards extra cover, where Dhananjaya took a good ing catch. That was such a fine innings from Foakes: 107 from 202 balls with 10 fours. 97th over: England 342-9 (Foakes 107, Anderson 0) He’s done it! Ben Foakes drives Lakmal down the ground for four to reaches an outstanding century on debut! He gets a standing ovation from the crowd and the England balcony. Foakes takes off his helmet, smiles with boyish joy and raises his bat modestly to all corners of the ground. He’s only the fifth wicketkeeper to make a century on debut, and it’s been a near flawless innings. As soon as he reaches the century, he goes into T20 mode and clouts Lakmal over midwicket for the third boundary of the over. And then...96th over: England 330-9 (Foakes 95, Anderson 0) There are four men round the bat for Anderson. Make that five men - silly point, short leg, two slips and a gully. He edges his third ball this far short of slip and leaves the fourth to elaborate cheers from the Barmy Army.Foakes will be nervous now! Leach edges to slip, where Dhananjaya de Silva takes a smart low catch. It was very close to a no-ball but he had a millimetre of heel behind the line. That’s Perera’s fifth wicket of the innings, and there are four balls left in the over.95th over: England 330-8 (Foakes 95, Leach 15) Foakes pushes Lakmal square on the off side for two, and then for another single. Five to go. He doesn’t look remotely nervous or hurried, and isn’t attempting to farm the strike at this stage.94th over: England 326-8 (Foakes 92, Leach 14) Leach dances down the track and chips Perera just short of the man at short extra cover. Two balls later he is beaten by a big-spinning delivery he won’t mind that too much given he’s about to bowl on this pitch. Another maiden.93rd over: England 326-8 (Foakes 92, Leach 14) Suranga Lakmal starts at the other end. Foakes, missing a work to leg, survives a strangled LBW appeal from a ball that would have bounced over the stumps. A maiden.“Nespresso aside, what’s your mid-term prediction, Mr. Smyth?” asks Bill Hargreaves. “(The pitch looks like they’ve had a fair on the outfield in that photo.)”Isn’t it a bit late for predictions?92nd over: England 326-8 (Foakes 92, Leach 14) Dilruwan Perera opens the bowling. Ben Foakes states his intentionos for the morning, driving the first ball of the morning superbly through extra cover for four. That takes him into the nineties. The over ends with Leach surviving a big shout for LBW. That looked close and I suspect Sri Lanka would have sent it upstairs had they not frittered away their reviews yesterday. This one might have been slipping past leg stump. Yes, replays show it was missing.“Morning Rob,” says John Leavey. “Bit pissed now and aiming to move to the lounge to watch the whole day of England dominationrain. Question is, how drunk can I get and fit in a nap before heading out for tonight’s piss up? Advice welcome. Cheers (hic).”Go to bed. Stay there. There are few things in life as miserable as grinding your way through a second booze-up of the day, while also nursing an 8pm hangover. Unless you’re still in your youthful prime - in which case, bottoms up!Play will start on time, according to my snout in Galle, also known as Cricinfo. Bear with me, I’m a bit bleary eyed. Another five minutes with my face in a vat of Nespresso should resolve the problem.Morning. Right, that’s enough of the formalities: Ben Foakes is 13 short of an exceptional debut century, and not even the most incorrigible ne’er-do-well would begrudge him that. England will resume on 321 for eight, a score which, depending on whose opinion you agree with, is over-par, under-par, a fine effort or a missed opportunity. On a normal Galle pitch, England could declare and still have a chance of an innings victory, but the wet weather has made it harder to judge what a good score might be in this match. We know the pitch will deteriorate we don’t know how much and how quickly it will do so. We’ll soon find out.Play starts at 4.30am GMT."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d44dcff05d7c5f25012bbb177ae6363936e20f7/1277_905_3160_1896/master/3160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c842466af98083487194299b24d8c01c","title":"misty copeland interview ballet broken disney nutcracker prince obama","story":"She thinks ballet’s broken – and has a plan to fix it. The star of Disney’s Nutcracker reboot talks about racism, nude shoes and growing up bendy‘Ballet was definitely my escape,” says Misty Copeland. “It was the first thing I’d ever experienced in my life that was mine – only mine, not my five other siblings’. It gave me a voice, made me feel powerful.”When Copeland discovered ballet she was 13, living with her mother and siblings in a motel in California. She was a shy, slight child who rarely spoke and tried not to be noticed. Twenty-three years later, hers is the kind of transformation story even ballet might think far-fetched. In 2015, she became the first black female principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre – and with that a spokesperson, poster girl, and bona fide star. Barack Obama sought her out as an adviser, Prince invited her on tour, Spike Lee wants her in his films, and people queue up to meet her at the stage door of the politan Opera House in New York.And now the latest chapter in her real-life fairytale has begun to unfold. Copeland is dancing in Disney’s The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, a cinema revamp of the Christmas favourite starring Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman.Like all ballet dancers, Copeland is petite and perfectly put together, beaming with unerring positivity and a ready giggle as she sits in this London hotel room with a camel mac draped over her knees to keep warm.This is a woman who’s had a tough life but seems to have come out of it with no hard edges. In ballet, where many things on stage look much as they did a century ago, there are few women of colour in major companies, and Copeland remembers the moment when she knew she had to take on the mantle of role model. She was watching a documentary about the Ballets Russes that featured pioneering black ballerina Raven Wilkinson. “I had this awakening,” she says. “I didn’t even know she existed. I saw her and it was this unexpected reaction. I was crying. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I have this bigger purpose that I never even realised.’”Copeland has actively sought out opportunities to bring ballet to new audiences and to change its image, from speaking engagements to endorsements and book deals. When millions of viewers see her in an Under Armour commercial, she says, “they will see a brown ballerina and think, ‘Oh, that’s what a ballerina looks like.’ When you can imagine yourself on the stage, especially as a young person, it allows you to dream of doing anything.”When she was a child, Copeland had no dreams of ballet. The family moved a lot as her mother married and orced several times, there was little money and Copeland kept her head down. But, in fact, she was always a ballerina – she just didn’t know it. She loved grossing out her brothers with what her hyper flexible joints could do, but she had no idea she might have the perfect physique for a particular type of dance. She hated her skinny, long legs, big hands and “pinhead”.Luckily, one of her teachers noticed. Copeland took her first ballet class on a basketball court at the local Boys and Girls Club, but it wasn’t until she stepped inside a studio, donned tights and leotard and looked at herself in the mirror that this homeless teen realised she had finally found home.Copeland was 13, a very late age to start dancing for a professional, but she progressed fast with teacher Cindy Bradley. When her mother could no longer take her across town to classes, Copeland moved in with Bradley (which led to a difficult, highly publicised custody battle, a low point in Copeland’s life). At 18, she joined American Ballet Theatre’s studio company, then its corps de ballet. But a serious stress fracture, followed by sudden weight gain after the delayed onset of puberty, led to her confidence crashing.Copeland credits her survival to a series of mentors, mainly successful black women outside dance, and to ABT’s director, Kevin McKenzie. “He was sensitive enough to see that I was a young girl on my own, had never really had a stable home. He did what he could to help me grow when other people within the artistic staff didn’t want to see me get those opportunities.” Because you hadn’t paid your dues? “No, because of my skin colour. Because of my body. I know those things for a fact.”As well as the overt racism, there were subtle signals that this wasn’t her world.Until recently, pointe shoes only came in a “nude” colour that was pale pink. “What does it mean that we’re wearing pink tights?” she asks. “It’s because that’s the colour you’re expected to be.” Ballet shoe maker Freed has just launched the UK’s first pointe shoes for darker skin tones (Gaynor Minden does a similar range in the US), although Copeland still colours hers with pancake makeup. “It’s the little things that make you feel like you don’t belong.”Things are changing, slowly. When Copeland arrived at ABT, which is based in New York, she was the only black woman there. Now there are three. Audiences are changing too. “Especially in the States – that’s something I’ve seen open up so much in the past five years. To see, outside the Met, a line stretching from the door to the street of brown young people.”But it’s not just about who’s on stage, it’s what they’re doing up there. “We’re getting them in the door,” says Copeland. “But now we have to keep them there. So I think we’re going to have to evolve again with the stories we’re telling, so people can connect with them.”How much responsibility does an art form have to reflect the world and send positive messages about race or gender? “I think it’s extremely important,” says Copeland. “Especially with ballet, if we don’t open ourselves up and evolve with the times, we’re not going to be relevant and people aren’t going to be interested in coming. I understand becoming a character, and that not every time you step on stage has to be some amazing political statement, but I also think we have so much room in classical dance to grow.”In the film, Copeland plays a ballerina in the land of toys come to life, dancing a ballet that tells the story of the Four Realms – as the Sugar Plum Fairy (Keira Knightley) and our heroine Clara (Mackenzie Foy) look on. The Nutcracker and the Four Realms has taken the well-worn favourite, with its notoriously weak plot, and given it some Hollywood drama-doctoring. It’s something film does all the time – could ballet not do the same? “Right!” says Copeland. “Absolutely!” The film, she says, gives more depth to a story “that can seem very light and cheesy”.It also has a feminist slant. In the original tale, Herr Drosselmeyer is the maker of magical toys, but in the film Clara’s mother is a more talented inventor. What’s more, Clara, something of a bystander in many Nutcracker ballets, is here heir to the Four Realms her mother created, and “a new kind of princess”.If a company like Disney, synonymous with the pretty princess myth, can drag itself into the 21st century on matters of gender and race, can’t ballet follow suit? “It’s scary for us to make change,” says Copeland. “It’s like, ‘Don’t fix what isn’t broken.’ But in my opinion, it is broken. The times are changing and we have to catch up. I think the more we bring in newer people with fresh ideas behind the scenes – artistic directors, choreographers – those things will change.”There are plenty of people in ballet who are doing exactly this (Tamara Rojo at English National Ballet comes to mind, having commissioned Akram Khan to reimagine Giselle). But elsewhere, tradition reigns supreme and a 19th-century worldview permeates many classic ballets. Copeland mentions the exotic eastern fantasies La Bayadère and pirate tale Le Corsaire. “You think of Corsaire as this light thing, but it’s not really. It’s slaves, these women chained up. I think we could have stories that really reflect different cultures in a fresh way, you know? Ballet is worldly, so let’s represent what we all are.”To this end, Copeland has set up a production company that has lots of ideas in the works. She has also been swapping ideas with Spike Lee, who keeps pushing her to act in his films. “I’m like, ‘No, I want you to help me create something.’”Nonetheless, she’s enjoying her on-camera moment in The Nutcracker, a role that cements what feels like a sudden rise to stardom but has actually been long in the making. Despite her innate talents, Copeland has always been playing catch-up for her late start. She wasn’t promoted to principal dancer until the age of 33 (“very late”). But in the last few years, everything has come together. She has even married her long-term boyfriend, lawyer Olu Evans.“I was such a late bloomer,” she says, “in terms of my emotional growth and the environments I grew up in. I feel like I progressed as a woman so late – but then when I did, it was all at once.” And now, it seems, there’s no stopping her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f02ef48b9cfa379183f759b310c96f0bc350607/353_0_8710_5228/master/8710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12c97df9acb16aeb2907565d711fda2","title":"beyond beijing six chinese cities you need to know suzhou lanzhou qingdao","story":"By 2030 China will overtake France as the world’s largest tourist destination, making culturally rich cities such as Suzhou, Lanzhou and Qingdao major attractionsMost visitors to China are inevitably drawn to the headline-stealing trinity of Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, all enormous, vibrant cities that are, justifiably, at the top of the list of must-sees. However, China has more than 100 cities of over 1 million residents, many of which remain little known to foreign travellers but boast attractions worth more attention.In the southern half of China’s fertile Jiangsu province, Suzhou has earned the nickname the Venice of the East thanks to its network of historic, picturesque canals. Suzhou has long been affluent and it supported a famous arts and cultural scene during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties it maintains a reputation as a centre for intellectuals to this day. While the city is now home to more than 6 million, the majority of whom live in the modern new parts of town, Suzhou’s old town features tiny canal-side alleyways, elegantly arched stone bridges and traditional whitewashed buildings overlooking beautiful gardens.While many come to Suzhou for its refined heritage, the big draw is the city’s historic gardens, nine of which are Unesco world heritage sites. Built over thousands of years by scholars and retired government officials, the gardens are exquisite examples of the classical Chinese style. The largest and most famous is the Humble Administrator’s Garden, which, while stunning, can get extremely busy. Visiting smaller gardens such as the Garden of Cultivation gives a better sense of the peaceful havens the gardens were originally designed to be. The city is also renowned for its silk production and has an excellent museum dedicated to the commodity.Getting thereSuzhou does not have its own airport. High-speed trains run regularly from Shanghai, taking as little as half an hour, and from Beijing, in around five hours.While sprawling, industrial Lanzhou itself is not a pretty town, its position at the head of the Hexi Corridor means it is the gateway to western China and a meeting point for distinct ethnic cultures. Its population of almost 4 million is made up of central Chinese Han, Hui Muslims and Zang Tibetans, influencing the city’s architecture, culture and food. A journey westwards through China is likely to pass through Lanzhou, which for centuries has been a transport hub, a vital stronghold along the Silk Road and the principal crossing point of the Yellow River, the city’s greatest sight.Crossing the Yellow River, which in recent years has been cleaned up and gentrified, is the Zhongshan Bridge, the first permanent bridge built across the river and now a major tourist attraction. From here, it’s an easy walk up the steep hillside of White Pagoda mountain park for good views over the city. Lanzhou’s white-tiled Xiguan mosque is the city’s largest and has Ming Dynasty heritage. Lanzhou is a great place for food lovers its namesake dish, Lanzhou beef noodles, are served spicy for breakfast, while Hezheng Road night market is the place to sample flavours of north-west China, including seasoned barbecued meats.Getting thereTwo high-speed train services a day connect Beijing and Lanzhou in around 8½ hours. Regular daily flights to Lanzhou’s well-connected airport take 2½ hours.Modern Lijiang is on a plateau, 2,400 metres above sea level and features a small Unesco world heritage old town, which is a picturesque maze of cobbled lanes, ided by a network of canals and pools that once provided the city’s drinking water. Lijiang is in China’s Yunnan province, which borders Vietnam to the south, and has long been home to Naxi, Yi and Bai ethnic groups, whose traditions can be experienced at the Impression Lijiang show, a performance that uses the city’s surrounding mountains as a spectacular backdrop.Since being damaged by an earthquake in 1996, the area’s traditional wood and stone buildings have been carefully restored, along with the graceful waterwheels that are among the oldest irrigation tools in China. Lijiang’s beauty has led to it becoming one of China’s biggest tourist draws and, in many ways, a victim of its own success. It is possible, however, to nip off the main tourist drags and wander backstreets free from crowds. With the peaks of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain rising behind, the elegant Deyue Pavilion is extremely beautiful and one of the city’s must-sees.Where to stayFeaturing design elements from local Naxi ethnic culture, Lost Horizon Resort (doubles from £66 room-only) is a few minutes’ walk from Black Dragon pond park, home of Deyue Pavilion. Some rooms have private terraces, others have garden views.Getting thereThere are a couple of flights a day from Beijing to Lijiang’s small airport, taking around 3½ hours. Alternatively fly to Kunming and transfer.While many will, perhaps unwittingly, recognise this seaside city’s name from sampling a bottle of China’s best-known beer, Tsingtao, few may know that Qingdao’s famous brewery is the result of the city’s German past. Annexed by Germany in 1897, after the murder of two German missionaries, it was ceded to the country for 99 years. Qingdao made an ideal deep-water port for the German navy and, while there, they established a brewery that produced the now-famous beer. The city was eventually taken over by the Japanese in 1914, before being returned to China in 1922. Getting thereRegular high-speed trains from Beijing to Qingdao take around five hours, while flying takes 1½ hours.The old port town of Xiamen is perhaps better known to outsiders as Amoy, the name used by foreign traders when the city was one of China’s Treaty Ports, opened after the first opium war ended in 1842. The city, however, first came to prominence during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when its naturally deep harbour became a hideout for pirates and a centre for illegal imports. During foreign occupation in the 19th century, Xiamen was famous for exporting teas from south-eastern Fujian province, before this trade moved to Taiwan. With mild and pleasant weather all year round, Xiamen is home to some of China’s nicest city beaches. Its relatively relaxed, holiday-resort feel belies the city’s huge size – almost 4 million people live here. There’s an atmospheric old town, with bustling narrow streets leading down to the busy seafront. Gulangyu Island, a 10-minute ferry ride off the city’s coast, was Xiamen’s foreign concession until the second world war and features the crumbling old colonial mansions of Europeans and Japanese settlers. Out into the countryside surrounding Xiamen, the otherworldly earthen Hakka roundhouses are worthy of a visit.Where to stayOn Gulangyu Island, just minutes from the ferry pier, Gulangyu Luyisi Villa Hotel (doubles from £35 room-only) offers uniquely decorated rooms in an old red-brick mansion. At night, Gulangyu is atmospheric, though also exceptionally quiet.Getting thereRegular flights from Beijing take around three hours, while the quickest trains from Shanghai reach Xiamen in about 6½ hours.Haikou, capital of Hainan Island, China’s southernmost province, has all the character of a typical south-east Asian city: a humid climate, pleasantly decaying colonial architecture, a laid-back vibe and palm tree-lined streets. With a population of around 2 million, Haikou is the driving force behind Hainan’s economic development and has long been an important port the city was opened to foreign trade under the Treaty of Tianjin in 1858. Hot year-round, Haikou makes for an interesting stop en route to exploring the rest of the island. Be sure to hit the old town’s unrestored backstreets for a glimpse of Haikou daily life, complete with washing strung up along telephone wires. Arcade buildings are the norm in this area, giving the Qi Lou (Arcade) Snack Street – the best place to sample the city’s street food – its name. Down the coast, the four-mile-long Holiday Beach hosts water activities such as windsurfing and kayaking on its golden sands.Getting thereRegular flights from Beijing take around four hours three hours from Shanghai.

Everything about the series, from its star to its tone to its subject matter to its home, screams hourlong prestige. But then, just as you’ve settled in for the long haul, the end credits roll. Episode one is wrapped up and put to bed in just 26 minutes. It’s incredible.Better yet, Homecoming is just one of a raft of exceptionally good new half-hour dramas. Netflix has Maniac, Amazon also has Forever, and even Facebook has Sorry For Your Loss. Each of these shows have the traditional trappings of an hourlong, and yet they’re shorter and punchier and all the better for it.They’re necessary, too. In an age where we’re being slowly suffocated with a tower of content that nobody can fully keep on top of, a half-hour drama simplifies things. Something like Maniac is a perfect example. It is a weird show – a weird premise that’s weirdly written and directed, and contains a clutch of weirdly mannered performances – and if it was made up of 10 hourlong episodes, the scale of it might put you off. But it’s short, so the risk is minimised. Whatever happens, you know it will be over quickly. The chances of encountering the sort of bloat you see on a series like House of Cards, where the middle six episodes uniformly fall into such a directionless fug that you invariably lose the will to live, are almost nil. Done right, a half-hour drama is all killer and no filler.Contrast that with something like The Romanoffs. Those episodes are as long as a film. You have to put an entire evening aside to watch them, and the payoff is minimal. Every episode of The Romanoffs so far has felt like a good half-hour idea stretched beyond all reasonable limits by a quest for hubris-driven prestige, and it’s intolerable. Same goes for Game of Thrones. We’re promised that the final season will be entirely made up of feature-length episodes, which sounds like a hell of a slog.In the time it takes to watch just one episode of The Romanoffs you can get almost halfway through an entire series of Forever, which is a much better bet. There’s more packed into one half-hour of Forever than most people can put inside an entire series. It’s a gem of a show odd, moving, funny and extraordinarily well acted. It’s so odd, in fact, that you can imagine Amazon executives baulking at the prospect of shelling out for hourlong episodes. But the half-hour format suits it perfectly. It’s a story told with just the right amount of economy. It feels like an experiment that’s gone right.However, there’s a chance that Forever won’t make a lot of end-of-year lists, and this might be a problem with half-hour dramas on the whole. Something like Sharp Objects, even though it often danced perilously close to the edge of self-parody, lasted for weeks and weeks. Reviews and recaps and word of mouth meant that it could build up a head of steam and remain part of the conversation for its entire duration. Meanwhile, Forever can be knocked off in a single afternoon. It’s a blip that culturally came and went with barely a murmur. Amazon would slit its neck before it offered up viewing figures but you suspect that, as terrific as it was, Forever was only watched by a fraction of the people who would have watched it if it was a big-time HBO hourlong spread out across two and a half months.But maybe things are changing. Traditionally, the half-hour show has always been rooted in comedy, but comedy has changed. FX’s Louie paved the way for comedies to become more experimental and contemplative. This, in turn, led to Transparent a bleak series that isn’t even remotely funny but is still somehow pitched as a comedy thanks to its half-hour runtime. And now the form has been perfected with Atlanta.Atlanta is a comedy on paper, but the reality is much more multifaceted. It’s also a melodrama, a horror series, a dark fairytale. Atlanta’s success in pulling off such a broad spectrum of tones has softened us up, to the point that we can now expect more from our half-hour shows. GLOW can show a woman’s descent into addiction while also giving us a sketch-show bottle episode. Forever can peal away from telling the story of a dissatisfied marriage to show us the entire arc of an entirely unrelated relationship. Homecoming can be a taut thriller that also has a weird emphasis on pelicans. To watch a half-hour drama in 2018 is to fling yourself into the unknown. You can keep your full hours, the best television being made right now is 30 minutes long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d222f03f8c511a9c46aa7f4ed4fd4ce8648a8f6/0_150_3775_2265/master/3775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d02ad646fa6db55d799abfae3828ed3","title":"are you voting in the 2018 us midterm elections tell us about it","story":"On 6 November we’d like to know what the atmosphere is like where you live.

Pelosi said Americans have all “had enough of ision”.“Thanks to you tomorrow will be a new day in America,” she said.Earlier in the evening, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, sought to downplay Democratic gains, saying: “Maybe you get a ripple, but I certainly don’t think that there’s a blue wave.”But Democrats racked up upsets across the country. Incumbent Randy Hultgren lost a traditionally Republican suburban district to Lauren Underwood, a 31-year-old African American nurse who ran a campaign focused on healthcare. Military veteran Max Rose pulled off an upset in a conservative district on Staten Island in New York, and the deep red state of Oklahoma elected Democrat Kendra Horn to a district centered around Oklahoma City.Elsewhere, Democrats Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland made history by becoming the first Native American women elected to Congress and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York became the first woman in her 20s to win a seat and was joined by 29-year-old Abby Finkenauer in Iowa.However, Republican control of the Senate will allow it to block House-passed Democratic initiatives on everything from healthcare to the potential repeal of tax cuts. And while Democratic results in the House showed signs of being the forecast “blue wave”, there were also disappointing losses in the Senate and the failure to win key governor’s offices in states like Florida and Ohio.The elections carry significant ramifications for what remains of Trump’s first term.With a majority in the House, Democrats are expected to launch a flurry of investigations into the president and his administration. The White House’s legal team is reportedly bracing for potential inquiries that include whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia investigation, the misuse of taxpayer dollars by several cabinet officials, and hush money paid to women to keep silent about their alleged affairs with Trump before he was elected president.The Democratic victory would also stonewall much of Trump’s agenda. Republicans have vowed to pursue further tax cuts and changes to popular government programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and social security. They have also pledged to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s healthcare law, should they remain in power.The increased Republican majority in the Senate, however, will make it easier for Trump to continue to appoint judges and remake the nation’s judiciary branch in a more conservative mold.Four Democratic incumbents lost in the Senate. Three-term incumbent Bill Nelson of Florida lost a tight race to the state’s governor Rick Scott, while two-term Democrat Claire McCaskill lost her re-election bid in Missouri.Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota – two Democrats who won in deep red states with Obama at the top of the ticket in 2012 – also lost their re-election bids. All four voted against the controversial confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court.In one of the most closely watched races of the cycle, the Republican Texas senator Ted Cruz fended off an unexpectedly tough challenge from Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat who inspired young voters and raised an unprecedented amount of money.In Tennessee, the Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn emerged victorious in a contest that drew national attention after pop star Taylor Swift endorsed the Democratic candidate, Phil Bredesen.Democrats were, however, able to breathe a small sigh of relief as Joe Manchin, another red-state Democrat, held on to his Senate seat in West Virginia, a state Trump won by 42 points in 2016. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, two other Democrats targeted by Republicans, were also re-elected.Democrats had been defending 10 Senate seats in states that Trump largely won by double digits two years ago, rendering the battle to win back the upper chamber of Congress an uphill struggle that was ultimately lost.Higher than usual turnout was reported across the country, where 36 governor’s contests reinforced the ramifications of what former president Barack Obama dubbed as perhaps “the most important election of our lifetimes”.At least two deep blue states voted to re-elect moderate Republican governors who succeeded by distancing themselves from Trump. Larry Hogan defeated Ben Jealous, the former chairman of the NAACP, in Maryland, while popular incumbent Charlie Baker resoundingly won in Massachusetts.Democrats nonetheless took several Republican-held governor’s offices: JB Pritzker, whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, unseated the Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, in Illinois. Democrat Gretchen Whitmer flipped Michigan blue for the first time in eight years, defeating Republican challenger Bill Schuette. And in Kansas, voters rejected Republican Kris Kobach, a hardline immigration activist who cozied up to Trump, in favor of Democrat Laura Kelly.However, the loss of Andrew Gillum in Florida marked a major disappointment for progressives.Democrats have sought to cast the 2018 midterms as a referendum on Trump, whose tenure in the White House has left Americans sharply polarized and has been defined by chaos, tribalism and the shattering of norms.Trump’s isive style was laid bare in the run-up to Tuesday’s election, which saw the president resort to unfounded claims about his political opponents and vitriolic rhetoric on immigration in an effort to energize his base – in contrast to the positive economic message that many down-ballot Republicans were touting.While crisscrossing the country on behalf of Republican candidates, Trump’s closing argument largely consisted of stoking fears around a caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and headed toward the US-Mexico border. The president also repeatedly declared that Democrats, if elected, would lead a “socialist takeover” of America.Although a number of Democratic heavyweights hit the trail to stump on behalf of candidates, including Obama, the narrative was still dominated by Trump and his freewheeling rhetoric.As he said at a rally on Indiana on Monday: “The midterm elections used to be, like, boring.“Who ever heard of midterms? Now it’s, like, the hottest thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a8fea9593eaac4781f2be3c9ec2486b6bc4e5fe/95_0_2704_1624/master/2704.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=5da34b02ba84f6ca4a1aa258a2323b63","title":"midterms 2018 first history making election wins","story":"Diverse candidates are hoping to break barriers across the country. Here are the key wins so farGroundbreaking campaigns have broken barriers this election, with historic candidates changing the face of Congress and statehouses across the US. Women have run in record numbers, and Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, millennials and LGBT candidates have already made history with their campaigns.Here are the key trailblazing candidates who are ersifying American politics and have already won their races so far. We will continue updating throughout the night as more results come in.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise victory in the June congressional primary in New York shook up Washington and the Democratic party. The progressive challenger and member of the Democratic socialist party unseated a powerful 10-term New York congressman, running with a campaign ad that said: “Women like me aren’t supposed to run for office.”Now age 29, she has become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Elise Stefanik previously held the record when she was elected to Congress at age 30 in 2014.Pressley was the first black woman to serve on Boston’s city council and made history again after defeating the 10-term incumbent Michael Capuano in the primary. She did not face a challenger in the general election, making her the first black member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts.In her victory speech in September, she said: “These times demanded more from our leaders and from our party. These times demanded an approach to governing that was bold, uncompromising and unafraid. It’s not just good enough to see the Democrats back in power but it matters who those Democrats are.”Tlaib ran unopposed in her race to represent Michigan’s 17th district and has become the nation’s first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, and one of two Muslim women elected on Tuesday.She is a Democratic-Socialist who served on the state legislature from 2009 to 2014 and ran her congressional primary campaign supporting Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing Ice. Tlaib was famously escorted from a Trump rally in 2016 as she shouted questions at the candidate, asking him if he had ever read the constitution.Ilhan Omar, also the first Somali-American in Congress, is a formerrefugee who spent the last four years as a state legislator. There, she pushed a progressive agenda, including a $15 minimum wage and subsidizing higher education costs for low-income students.As the Democratic nominee for governor in Colorado, Polis ran on a leftwing platform, which included single-payer healthcare, repeal of the death penalty, universal full-day preschool and stronger gun laws. Polis, who declared victory late Tuesday night, has long been outspoken in favor of marijuana legalization.Kate Brown, who is bisexual, became the first openly LGBT person elected governor in 2016 when she won her Oregon race. Jim McGreevey, a Democrat and former New Jersey governor, came out while in office in 2004.An attorney and former MMA fighter, Davids became the first Native American congresswoman and the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas.Raised by a single mother army veteran and a member of the Wisconsin-based Ho-Chunk Nation, Davids was a fellow in the Obama White House.In New Mexico, Deb Haaland became the first Native American woman to chair a state political party. Now, the former Democratic chair has also become the first Native American congresswoman in the US, alongside Davids. A citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, Haaland is a longtime activist who ran on a progressive platform, including Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, and the impeachment of Trump.A Republican who represents Tennessee’s 7th congressional district, Blackburn has become the first female senator in the state. Her race received national attention after the pop star Taylor Swift, who previously avoided politics, endorsed Blackburn’s opponent, the Democratic former governor Phil Bredesen. Blackburn has been closely aligned with Trump and is farther to the right than the GOP senator she is replacing.Maine has elected its first female governor, the Democrat Janet Mills, who was the state’s attorney general. She declared victory early Wednesday morning and is replacing a controversial and bombastic Republican governor, Paul LePage. She regularly clashed with LePage, who is known for his overtly racist comments and was once caught threatening a state lawmaker in an an obscenity-laced voicemail.In Iowa, Abby Finkenauer beat the Republican Rod Blum, who has held the seat since 2014. In addition to being the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa, at age 29, she is also one of the youngest people ever elected to the House. She is a two-term Democratic state representative.2016 National Teacher of the Year and first-time political candidate Jayana Hayes won her bid to represent Connecticut’s fifth congressional district. Hayes is the first black woman to represent the state in the Congress, and, alongside Massachusetts’ Pressley, will be one of the first two women of color to represent New England.More than a third of the population of the Lone Star state may be Latino, but until Tuesday, no Latina had been elected to represent the state in congress. Veronica Escobar, a former county judge, won her race in Beto O’Rourke former district in El Paso, while Sylvia Garcia trounced her Republican opponent in Houston.“It’s about time,” Garcia told supporters, according to the Texas Tribune. “But you know, it’s never been about being a first. It’s always been about being the best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7d44ec33fd2ae32fec77f9aa1604255daf52f4b/104_0_3152_1892/master/3152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=391850c9b005a27ce9b55a6dd1df03b9","title":"democrats house of representatives blue wave midterms","story":"Two years after the tears, the heartbreak and sad piles of redundant confetti at Hillary Clinton’s election party, the Democratic party is back – and millions of Americans are breathing a sigh of relief.The much-vaunted blue wave was real in the House of Representatives. It swept Republicans away in numerous districts, probably giving the speaker’s gavel back to Nancy Pelosi, ending one-party rule and imposing a check on Donald Trump.“We rebuked Trump and Trumpism at a critical moment,” Ilya Sheyman, executive director of the grassroots organisation MoveOn wrote in a celebratory email.Many Democrats will be tempted to see the glass as half empty, engaging in self-flagellation over narrow defeats for some of its rising stars and a worse-than-expected loss of ground in the Senate. But the truth is that in the face of gerrymandering, voter suppression and an economy that continues to stay in the strong shape that Barack Obama bequeathed, the party reclaimed the House majority for the first time in eight years. That is no small achievement.It did so maintaining a disciplined focus on healthcare, notably the threat to protections for pre-existing conditions under Obamacare, as the decisive issue. There was also revulsion towards Trump among women, independents and people in the middle-class suburbs of major cities.Democrats won Republican-held seats in Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Kendra Horn won a stunning upset over the Republican Steve Russell in Oklahoma. After two years of the White House as chaotic reality TV show, the American people have demanded oversight by giving the Democrats a powerful say again in how Washington works.Victory in the House was also victory for an alternative to Trump’s vision of America. This was the first time in US history that most of a major party’s nominees were not white men. It was the year of the woman.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old Latina, became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland became the first Native American women elected to the House. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan became the first Palestinian-American and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota became the first Somali-American in the chamber. And this in a climate where Trump spent his final campaign rallies whipping up fear of and hostility towards a migrant caravan still hundreds of miles from the US border.Jim Dean, chair of the progressive political action committee Democracy for America, said: “The flip of the US House to Democratic control is a direct repudiation of Donald Trump’s white nationalist agenda, a clear mandate for multiracial inclusive populism, and a testament to the leadership of the new American majority of black, brown and progressive white voters who made it possible.”Democrats have picked themselves up off the canvas and given Trump a bloody nose. But, taking the election as a whole, there is no denying it was a split decision.In recent months, expectations beyond the House had been set so high that many will still feel a sting of disappointment. Three marquee races have garnered huge media attention and Democrats lost at least two of them: Beto O’Rourke fell to Senator Ted Cruz in Texas and Andrew Gillum, lost his bid to become the first African American governor of Florida.There were other painful blows for female senators, such as Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Retaining the Senate, where the map had always favoured Republicans this time, enabled Trump to declare victory in a tweet: “Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!”The reality, however, is that the House will now be a thorn in the president’s side. It can block his legislative agenda and bombard the White House with investigations and subpoenas and demands for Trump’s tax returns. It can also dig into the mystery of Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential election.The Politico website noted: “White House staffers can expect to work past midnight battling congressional committees, wage exhausting fights over redactions to internal documents, suffer through mind-numbing meetings with government lawyers about the nuances of executive privilege and see their memos and emails leaked to the media by freshly empowered Democratic investigators.”All this may yet play to Trump’s advantage for the 2020 presidential election, with Pelosi giving him a foil to run against, a scapegoat to blame for not getting his border wall built. For now, Democrats can take heart that 2016 was rock bottom and they are on the way back.

In week five of his blog,  Alexi Duggins finds out how to meet, greet and mean it Fifteen years ago, I had the worst job interview of my life. For two excruciating hours, I was subjected to brutal The Apprentice-style grilling. Management jargon was fired like bullets as my (admittedly misguided) dream of a career in graduate recruitment was reduced to smoking rubble.Then, as I turned to leave, it got personal: “I’ll be honest with you. You need a haircut if you want even the slightest chance of working here. Your hairstyle doesn’t create a good first impression.”I shook his hand and turned to the door. “Actually,” he added, “you should get a better handshake as well.”While it’s been a good few years since that moment, when I watch  Labs and Philips’ video about creating a stonking first impression, I do wonder, could mine still do with some work? Particularly as, in just under a week, I have a big meeting with a potential client, where it’s essential that I impress.Hmm … I decide to spend the next few days trialling the video’s advice.MondayLooking at my schedule for today, it seems unlikely that I’m going to have the opportunity to make any first impressions at all, unless my weekly night of wedding admin suddenly turns out to be a ticket to a crunk party.So my best option to impress new people seems to be the tube. I decide to start with the simplest piece of advice in the video: “Smile!” and I try beaming at passengers who catch my eye. Largely, this seems to have the opposite of its intended effect, as people quickly glance downward on making eye contact.The exception is one suited 40-something who returns my smile and holds eye contact for so long that it occurs to me that my fiancee would definitely not be happy to hear about this experience. I realise that perhaps what I have actually managed is something more like flirting, and suspend my efforts for the day.TuesdaySmile now toned down to more platonic levels, I beam at a middle-aged woman I pass on the street near my office. She stops me in my tracks. “Do you know, you’re the first friendly face I’ve seen today? I’ve just moved here from Guernsey and people are just so much less welcoming!” For the next 15 minutes, she opens up about what island life is like, the things that make London bearable and her pride at recently becoming a grandmotherunpaid babysitter (her reason for moving here). Safe to say that I’ve made a good impression and, frankly, it’s lovely. Although I am now very late for work.WednesdayNo smiling at people today. I can’t afford to be late for work again. But I now only have two days until my big client meeting, so I test out my handshake when one of my fiancee’s friends comes over to pick up a dress. “It’s good!” she smiles with relief when I press her for a verdict. “You’re saying hello and you mean it!”This is a weight off my mind, given the job interview feedback. It also sounds like I’m following the video’s advice to ensure you keep your handshake firm. “Although saying that, I guess I don’t like strong, alpha male handshakes,” she finishes. Hmm, perhaps there is work to do.Thursday“Ow! You’re not Donald Trump!” replies one of my friends as I test out my new improved, extra-firm handshake on him in the pub. “Ooh no, too limp: bit creepy,” offers another as I try relaxing it. “Fine, but what’s up with your face? You’re concentrating so hard you look constipated!” says another. I’m tempted to yell: “I have a big meeting tomorrow, I need to get this right!”But instead, I cast all thoughts from my mind and just do my normal handshake. “Good. Firm, but not too firm. Do that in future.” Maybe my handshake was OK after all.FridayIt’s the day of judgment. As my smile has proved capable of generating new friends, I decide to do more of that. I also choose to just go with my natural handshake, spiced up with other tips from the video, like saying: “Great to meet you!” (Even if the thought makes me feel like a happy-clappy customer greeter at Disneyland.)And it goes really well. Everyone smiles. No winces from my handshake. And when I uttered my greeting, every single one of them also replied: “Great to meet you!” In fact, they did it so naturally that it made me realise that the rest of the world clearly does this every time they meet another human being. I’ve been missing out.As I leave, a colleague turns to me: “I think that went really well!” And, frankly, so do I: way better than my meetings normally do.As I head off, I realise that this advice has been thoroughly useful. While there have been points where it’s gone a bit off the rails, they were when I was trying too hard, rather than acting natural. Making a good impression definitely involves a bit of smiling, eye contact and cheerful greeting. But there’s something even more important than that. You’ve got to be pretty hip-hop about it. You’ve also got to keep it real.Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s finding your inner confidence or a grooming routine that works for you.

Journalist and podcaster  Jimi Famurewa reviews his journey through fashion faux pas to stylish gentWhen I think of the questionable fashion choices that litter my past – the time I sported two bumbags as a 10-year-old, the roomy skater jeans I liked to wear halfway down my backside, that summer when I really, really got into leather wrist cuffs and backpacker-ish beads – there is one ill-advised look that always sticks out. In fact, among some of my oldest friends, it has almost taken on a mythic quality: a folkloric garment shrouded in legend and whispered rumour.It would have been around the late 90s and, as a 16-year-old, I had successfully badgered my mum into getting me a pair of wincingly tight, metallic silver jeans from the Littlewoods catalogue. I looked, in my eyes, incredible. Bold. Vaguely futuristic. And it was only when I saw my kind friend Chris’s gaping, faintly horrified expression – having risked a split crotch by sprinting to catch the bus for a night out – that I thought something might be up. “Jesus,” he said, unable to mask his disbelief, “you look like the Tin Man.”Despite the evidence to the contrary in this story, I’ve always thought of myself as, mostly, quite an assured dresser. I was lucky enough to have two innately stylish older brothers who provided useful visual guidance, stacks of style-minded men’s magazines, plus whatever clothes I could sneakily liberate from their bedrooms.This fortune gave me the confidence, as a tween, to chafe ever-so-slightly against the “Ben Sherman and Reebok Classics” hegemony of the time. Having siblings who were willing to take risks with their look basically meant that (the odd clanger notwithstanding), I always understood that there was nothing wrong with experimenting a little bit.But there’s something about climbing to the figurative base camp of your mid-30s, as I have now, that makes you reappraise everything that has come before. Obviously these days, men’s fashion has never been a bigger or more varied industry – in June, Euromonitor was the latest market researcher to find that it is growing at a faster rate than women’s fashion. But, squinting warily at old pictures on Facebook, I can’t help but wonder if my unabashed interest in cultivating a personal style occasionally manifested as, well, misguided overconfidence.Trends and personal phases are partially to blame, of course. Midway through my teenage years I became a skateboarder and soon found myself weighed down by enormous hoodies, baseball caps and chunky scuffed-up trainers. This gave way to the UK garage years – tight Reiss T-shirts, tighter jeans and Patrick Cox loafers worn without socks – which slowly evolved into a more casual university look with looser, paint-spattered Diesel jeans, clunky statement belts and, at one point, a thoughtlessly grabbed vintage T-shirt that looked like it said “IRA” on the back.Grooming-wise, this was also the time that – save one turn-of-the-millennium night when I briefly twisted my hair into little Craig David-style buds – I started to tweak the neatly trimmed look I’d had since my double-bumbag days. As I emerged from university (and increasingly frequented sticky-floored indie club nights), I grew my hair out into a kind of knotted demi-fro that was heavily indebted to (read: shamelessly stolen from) Bloc Party frontman Kele Okereke.It’s here that I think my life as something of a charity-shop peacock truly began. I lived in winklepickers, tweedy blazers, pocket squares, deliberately moth-eaten, plunge-neck T-shirts and jeans so skinny they often ripped if I overdid it on the dance floor. There was a cherished, patterned cravat that I’m pretty sure I found on the floor outside a house party.In isolation (and the context of the guitar-mad mid-noughties), there was nothing wrong with any of this. But it was just all too much. The volume was up way too high. In thrall to a certain scene or look, I had surrendered all subtlety and true iniduality in favour of a kind of box-ticking maximalism.So how did I shed those fussy adornments and arrive at the quieter, workwear-focused uniform I tend to employ today? Well, fatherhood – which brings with it clothes that are often accidentally accessorised with a smear of mashed-up food – has definitely made my taste more utilitarian and less prissy. Taking inspiration from well turned-out colleagues in their 40s – all turned-up selvedge denim (finished with tightly woven bands) and Red Wing boots – certainly helped. And, in swapping Albam chore jackets for All Saints blazers, I’m certainly broadly in line with the times.But I think, more than all that, it’s the hard-won self-knowledge that can only come with age. Rather than swinging wildly from one trend to the next, I’ve found a groove that suits and reflects me. I no longer feel vaguely deficient if my look doesn’t neatly conform with what’s on a particular shop mannequin or musician or off-duty footballer. My hair has morphed into a low-maintenance, ragged low-top and I let my beard grow out when the mood strikes me. I invest in quality key pieces – slouchy shirts, Breton-style tees, go-with-anything white trainers – rather than haphazardly splurging on youthful fast fashion wheezes.The clothes, as per the often misattributed Mark Twain quote, do not actually make the man. It’s the other way around.

His father was a travelling salesman, his mother a housewife, and he had a sister, Ruth, who was seven years older. He says his parents sheltered him from the deteriorating conditions for Jews in the 1930s, but\u0026nbsprecalls seeing brownshirts – SA paramilitaries – parading in the streets and once caught sight of Adolf Hitler passing on a train.\u0026nbspOn Kristallnacht, a cold November night, his family were marched down to the town square with other Jews while their burning synagogues lit up the sky around them. Koschland’s father was taken away to the concentration camp of Dachau, near\u0026nbspMunich. He was released a few weeks later, and applied for places on the Kindertransport for his son and daughter, promising that he and his wife would join them as soon as possible. “A child takes a promise like that not just at face value, but at full value,” says Koschland.His place on the Kindertransport was obtained with the help of Jewish organisation B’nai B’rith, and, aged eight, he left Fürth in March 1939, travelling to Hamburg and then taking a ship to Southampton – a picture of the ship, the SS Manhattan which brought 80 refugee children to the UK, adorns the wall of his living room. The only English he knew was one sentence his parents had taught him: “I’m hungry may I have a piece of bread?” His sister was allowed to travel soon afterwards, boarding with a family in south London, but did not see her brother again until later in the war.\u0026nbspKoschland went to a hostel in Margate, in Kent, before being evacuated in 1940 to a village near Lichfield in the Midlands, where he boarded with an elderly Jewish family. He exchanged letters with his\u0026nbspparents until war broke out in September 1939. One of his great regrets is that, at the suggestion of a\u0026nbspschool friend who told him that having letters in German in wartime would incriminate him, he destroyed them. “I’ve regretted it every day since,” he says.Koschland lost contact with his parents at that point and spent the war not knowing what had happened to them. He was told of their fate after the war had ended in 1945 by his sister, who met him from school and told him that a survivor of the camps had provided information that they had been deported and were dead, murdered either in Riga in Latvia or Izbica in Poland in 1942. I\u0026nbspask him how he coped with the news. “I took it in my stride,” he says. “There was nothing I could do, and life had to go on. It was only as I grew older that it started to hit me hard, when I heard other people saying: ‘We are going to see Mum and Dad.’ That was something I couldn’t do.”Nonetheless, he says he never had the survivor guilt that plagued so many others who escaped the Holocaust. “I’ve never had that feeling of being guilty. I’m thankful that my parents sent me away to carry on living. I can’t undo the past. I can think of the past, but I have to look at today and tomorrow. That’s the lesson I give to the youngsters I talk to.”Many years later, he was invited to visit Fürth by the town authorities, staying in a hotel overlooking the town square – now renamed Freedom Square – where, on Kristallnacht, his family had gathered as their community burned. “I had the perhaps childish feeling that I can now walk across it, even though you made me stand there, years ago,” he recalls. And walk across it he did, pleased to have outlived the regime that killed his parents.• Remembering the Kindertransport: 80 Years On is at the Jewish Museum, 129-131 Albert Street, London NW1 from 8 November to 10 February www.jewishmuseum.org.ukTomorrow: Ruth Barnett: ‘Years later, my mother appeared, a total stranger’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b77bf84818c456c48cec15b04b4f91e653ed06d/0_98_2503_1502/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e8d1cfe6cc5ea9fdecf989a28afcdc","title":"twist in alleged 1bn art as russian tycoon detained in monaco","story":"Dmitry Rybolovlev, owner of AS Monaco, has been under investigation by prosecutors in the principalityPolice in Monaco have detained Russian tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev for questioning as part of an investigation into corruption and influence peddling, according to reports.Rybolovlev, who owns the football club AS Monaco, was held on Tuesday and police also searched his luxury residence in Monaco, Le Monde newspaper said.A judge in the principality has been investigating whether Rybolovlev sought to influence law enforcement officials in his long-running dispute with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier.The Russian alleges Bouvier swindled him out of $1bn by overcharging him on 38 pieces of art he purchased over a 10-year period and is suing his former art adviser in Monaco, Singapore and Switzerland. Bouvier has denied wrongdoing.The Monaco prosecutor confirmed an operation linked to the investigation but declined to say if Rybolovlev was being questioned by police.Asked about the Le Monde report, Rybolovlev’s lawyers in Russia declined to comment on whether he was being questioned and said: “We request that the presumption of innocence in relation to Mr Rybolovlev is strictly respected.”All those involved have denied wrongdoing.The Russian businessman, who earned his multi-billion-dollar fortune through the sale of two Russian fertiliser producers, bought Donald Trump’s Palm Beach mansion in 2008 for about $100m.The questioning of an inidual under investigation is a standard procedure. Being under investigation in Monaco is not equivalent to being charged. It is the first step in an investigation.The feud between Rybolovlev and Bouvier led to the resignation in September of the head of Monaco’s judicial services after Le Monde daily wrote about connections between Rybolovlev and Monegasque justice officials.Rybolovlev spent more than $2bn buying 38 masterpieces from Bouvier between 2003 and 2014.In 2017, Rybolovlev sold Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Christ, Salvator Mundi, for $450m at a Christie’s auction, making it the most expensive painting ever sold.Ryboloblev has also sued Sotheby’s for $380m, alleging the auction house helped Bouvier defraud him.

Her son was in prison. She was trying to look after his two young children, who were aged one and two. Their mother was emotionally unstable. Bugget-Kellum did not want the chaos of the adults’ lives passed down to another generation.“We didn’t know if they would be safe with their mother,” she recalled recently. “I began to pray, please God, I need some help. There were so many things going on.”While at the clinic, Bugget-Kellum learned about a new parenting programme designed for carers of young children who have faced early adversity such as domestic abuse, homelessness or the loss of a parent to incarceration. “It was like I had my ammunition and I knew how to fight,” said Bugget-Kellum of the programme.The scheme, called Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-up (ABC), pairs parents with a coach trained in the needs of infants and toddlers who have experienced trauma.Bugget-Kellum’s coach reinforced simple techniques to form a healthy bond between adult and child, and helped her work through her own emotional wounds to create a less stressful environment at home. The results were so transformative, she said, that she started working as a parent coach for the same programme.“I have a son who is 26 and in prison, so I’m thinking maybe had I had an opportunity to get some of this, I don’t know, maybe I could have been more nurturing,” she said. “ABC gave me the confidence to say, you can do this. I don’t have to be angry with myself any more.”Traumatic or highly stressful childhood experiences are known to have lifelong emotional, behavioural and physiological impacts. Children who are abused, neglected, or exposed to conflict, violence and horror, are far more likely to have drink and drug problems, criminal records and perhaps resort to violence and abuse themselves. But researchers have also found that interventions such as the ABC programme can significantly buffer the damaging effects of stress and trauma, even at a biological level.A growing number of advocacy and public health organisations are working to bring “trauma-informed” approaches into the mainstream for doctors, carers and first responders.Scientists are continuing to untangle the complex biological effects of childhood trauma on the brain and body. Research in the past decade points to “toxic stress” as the root of the connection between adverse childhood experiences (Aces) and health problems in adult life.The theory is that continuous or repetitive exposure to stressful situations through, say, domestic abuse, or growing up in poverty, causes the body’s natural fight-or-flight stress response to stay switched on. Researchers say that without the influence of a caring and calming adult the stress becomes “toxic”, and elevated cortisol levels change the functioning of the child’s brain, weakening the immune system and even altering the way a child’s DNA is “read and transcribed”.“This is the source that a lot of the problems in our society can be traced to,” said Leena Singh, programme director for the National Paediatric Practice Community on Adverse Childhood Experiences (NPCC), which has an office in San Francisco. “There is a saying in public health – we need to move upstream. This is the work that is the root of the root.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theSingh’s organisation is working to integrate screening for adverse childhood experiences into standard paediatric primary care. The programme hopes to recruit 1,000 clinicians to screen 300,000 children for Aces over three years and is running pilot sites at six clinics across the US, with plans to add more.Singh says paediatricians have a vital role to play. They could refer patients for behavioural therapy or social support, but in medical schools they are rarely trained in the impacts of toxic stress. There are logistical hurdles to overcome too, such as how to add another process on to providers that are already overburdened, and how to bill insurers for time spent screening.NPCC says it is working through its pilot sites and member network to resolve those problems. It is also involved, through its parent organisation, the Center for Youth Wellness, with a clinical study on the effects of Ace interventions on certain biomarkers.Ultimately, Singh believes, their work could contribute to long-term shifts in the paediatric field. “If we can address and intervene early when some of these things happen in very young children we can actually prevent some of the risky behaviours and health impacts later in life.”One of the main challenges in pushing the model further, say proponents of trauma-informed care, is the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the approach. Researchers, including the CYW group and Mary Dozier, creator of the ABC intervention, say they are working to fill that gap. Many programmes take a two-generation approach to try to short-circuit the cycle of physical, emotional or substance abuse. Tennessee, for instance, is in the third year of its Building Strong Brains initiative, a $1.25m scheme to fund innovative Aces-focused programmes across the state.One programme funded under the initiative, called Thrive by 5, will conduct Aces screening on all pregnant women at the Baptist Memorial Hospital for Women in Shelbyville. Women who report four or more of the different types of childhood adversities (physical, sexual or emotional abuse, neglect, domestic violence, household substance abuse or mental illness, parental separation, orce or incarceration) will receive programme interventions and parenting education.Another programme called Handle With Care, which started in West Virginia and since expanded, allows police officers to notify a child’s school if they are called to their home for potentially traumatic event like domestic abuse or a shooting. School officials don’t receive any incident details but the notice allows them to better respond to behavior changes or offer necessary support to the student.The “infant courts” are also expanding. Zero to Three, an advocacy group for early child development resources, started piloting “safe babies court teams” in 2005, and now has more than 20 sites across the US. The teams work with young children separated by the court from their parents, often because of abuse or neglect, providing developmental medical screening, mental health services and community advocates to ease the trauma of entering the foster care system.Parents can receive psychological services too to deal with traumas of their own – a study by such a team found that more than two-thirds of parents in the programme had an Ace score of four or higher.Tucked inside a bipartisan opioid epidemic bill just signed by Donald Trump, called the Support for Patients and Communities Act, are several federal provisions encouraging wider recognition of Aces and trauma-informed care. The bill calls for an “interagency task force” to identify best practices within three years for mitigating the impact of trauma on infants and children and to create a national strategy to improve coordination of trauma-informed care at a federal level. The bill also authorises the Department of Education to provide grants to schools for mental health programmes to help mitigate the impacts of childhood trauma.Experts say greater cross-sector collaboration and more funding is needed for trauma-informed care to really make a difference. “The lifelong manifestations of that childhood trauma are cross-sector – it effects educational outcomes, employment opportunities, it affects your health,” said Marc’s Lieberman. “You’re not going to make a population-level impact without a cross-sector approach.”That makes the execution of trauma-informed care inherently complicated. But at bottom there is a simple and revolutionary idea, says Lieberman: “It’s about moving from ‘what’s wrong with you?’ to ‘what happened to you?’”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688863.1541542211!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"landmark deal could seal about 5 000 us visas a year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAbout 10,500 E3 visas are available to Australian citizens each year, but only about half of the visas are taken up.

Under new legislation being drafted by the US department of homeland security, Irish citizens would be eligible to apply for any visas not used in the allocation. This could equate to about 4,000-5,000 visas per year.The Government’s special envoy to the US, John Deasy, said the Bill had bipartisan support and was being viewed as a non-contentious measure.“The introduction of the Bill in Congress is the first step in this process. If successful, our attention will then focus on the US Senate,” he said. He added that he expected the Bill would be dealt with under a procedure known as “suspension of the rules” which allows the House to process non-contentious measures swiftly.Mr Deasy, who has travelled to Washington in recent weeks, has been holding discussions with the office of House speaker Paul Ryan on a deal. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Washington has also been centrally involved.A key element of the agreement is that Ireland would ease the requirements for Americans who want to retire to Ireland, including granting US citizens the right to work for up to 20 hours a week.In addition, the minimum annual income levels currently required to retire to Ireland would be lowered."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688708.1541531150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"consultants and nurses should not be on extended christmas holidays taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said we need a winter plan for hospitals where all beds are open “not the kind we have had for years and years that does not work.” Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsNurses and hospital consultants should not take holidays in early January, the Taoiseach has told the Dáil as it debated plans to deal with overcrowding in hospitals this winter. Mr Varadkar also said a new HSE winter plan is needed where hospitals are not effectively closed for seven of the 12 days of Christmas and new year.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also said that in such a plan “consultants would not be on holidays in the first week of the year, particularly those who work in emergency departments and nurses will not be on leave in the first two weeks of January”.He said radiology departments and laboratories should be open and operating “at full whack” over Christmas and new year. “We need to make sure that every bed will be open. That is the kind of winter plan we need, not the kind we have had for years and years that does not work.”Mr Varadkar said that between December 22nd this year and January 3rd next year there were 12 days, seven of which would be Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays and hospitals were effectively closed for seven of those 12 days.He was responding to Fianna Fáil criticism and details of a HSE review, revealed in The , which showed that funding for winter planning in hospitals was effectively supplied too late to be of optimal use last year and that such resources should be agreed in July. The final plan for this winter will only be submitted to the Department of Health in the coming days, however.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said that too many people, particularly the elderly “are suffering too much in emergency departments because of the absence of planning”.He said a document leaked to The  examined the lessons to be learned from the winter 2017 health crisis. “We are now in November and we still have not seen a winter plan announced,” he said.This was learned “through a leaked report, via Martin Wall, who makes up for the absences of transparency with the Government and the Department of Health ... by revealing confidential letters on a regular basis,” he added.One such document revealed that €50 million to be spent on additional beds was not spent but was instead used to deal with the excessive spending of 2017.Mr Martin said “that is incredible and it strains government credibility on the health issues, particularly in terms of emergency departments, to the very limit”.Mr Varadkar said that as a doctor and a grandson he did not want to see any patient spending time on trolleys waiting for beds.He added that there were 391 patients on trolleys on Tuesday morning, an increase of about 28 per cent on last year but “it is much the same as it was two years ago and most of those patients will be in beds by this evening”.The Taoiseach added that 240 new beds had been opened in 11 hospitals across the State and 79 more would be open by the end of March next year.He acknowledged that much of the reason more beds could not be opened had to do with planning. He said hospitals, consultants, nurses and other staff needed to operate at full capacity at Christmas, New year and in the early weeks of January.Mr Martin said Mr Varadkar had been in government for eight years and “needs to go and do it”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688807.1541542506!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"proposed us visa deal welcomed by campaigners","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJohn Deasy, the Government’s special envoy to the US,  is confident that the proposal has bipartisan supportNews of a possible visa deal allowing Irish citizens to live and work in the United States will be welcomed by immigration campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic. Ireland has long argued that the number of visas allocated to Irish citizens does not reflect the strong historic links between Ireland and the US. More than 35 million Americans claim Irish heritage.Under a Bill that has been brought to the House of Representatives, Ireland would be allocated the portion of E3 visas not taken up by Australian citizens. Australia is currently the only country with the coveted E3 scheme, and is allocated 10,500 each year. The E3 is a two-year renewable visa which allows Australian citizens and their spouses to live and work in the United States. Australia negotiated the visa programme in 2005 as part of the US-Australia trade agreement. Applicants must have a job in the United States to quality and have certain academic or other qualifying credentials. But the E3 is significantly easier and less costly to obtain that the tradition H1B visa. The Government’s special envoy to the US, John Deasy, is confident that the proposal has bipartisan support, though it still needs to be endorsed by both the House and the Senate. This is not the first time Ireland has sought inclusion in the E3 scheme a similar proposal was put forward in 2015 but ultimately failed to get adequate congressional support. One key difference this time, according to officials, is the involvement of House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ireland is also offering a reciprocal arrangement to America which will see the Department of Justice ease the requirements for Americans who want to retire in Ireland. It is thought that the best chance Ireland has of securing a deal is in the coming weeks during the so-called “lame-duck” session of Congress when the outgoing members of the House and Senate continue to sit before the new members take their seats in January. One outstanding question is the status of the undocumented Irish already living in the US. While in the first instance the E3 visa scheme is likely to apply to future flows of Irish people, sources have indicated that discussions are also under way about accommodating undocumented Irish citizens who may qualify. Whatever the shape of the new Congress, the next few weeks appears to offer the best chance for Ireland to secure a breakthrough and make real progress on immigration reform.The news from Washington comes as the Irish Government on Tuesday approved a series of measures to deepen and enhance Irish-US relations, specifically inviting more American politicians to visit Ireland.While the Taoiseach and Ministers have made 169 visits to the US since 2012, visits by American politicians are rarer, and the Government will seek to invite more US mayors, members of Congress and national politicians to Ireland in the coming years.Approving a review of US-Ireland relations brought to Cabinet by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, the Government decided that there should be “aggressive engagement” with Irish-American politicians in the new Congress.The review also calls for more Irish diplomatic staff on the ground in the US, as well as the opening of a new consulate in Los Angeles.Share your stories and opinions with other readers, and receive the best Abroad content every week by email"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688764.1541542750!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk cabinet could agree to backstop review deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGeoffrey Cox, the UK’s attorney general, arriving at 10 Downing Street for a cabinet meeting.

Photograph: BloombergTheresa May’s cabinet could meet later this week to sign off on a proposal for a review mechanism to determine how Britain could exit a backstop after Brexit. Mrs May told ministers on Tuesday that she wanted a withdrawal deal with the EU as soon as possible but not at any price.EU negotiators believe there must be movement on the backstop by the end of this week if there is to be a special summit to approve the withdrawal deal before the end of this month.During a cabinet meeting that lasted almost three hours, every minister contributed to a discussion of the Brexit negotiations which focused on the backstop. Attorney general Geoffrey Cox described the EU’s willingness to consider a review mechanism for the backstop as a “major step” towards a deal.Mr Cox is understood to have told ministers that a mechanism based on mutual consent could offer Britain the same certainty as a unilateral mechanism favoured by Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who spoke to Mrs May about a review mechanism on Monday, has ruled out a unilateral option.The prime minister’s official spokesman cautioned against speculation that a breakthrough was imminent, adding that Mrs May had stressed that nothing would be agreed until everything, including the future framework, was agreed.“She said that while 95 per cent of the withdrawal agreement had been concluded, on the Northern Ireland backstop there are a number of issues that we still need to work through, and these are the most difficult. This includes ensuring that, if the backstop is ever needed, it is not permanent, and there’s a mechanism to ensure that the UK could not be held in the arrangement indefinitely.“The prime minister said she was confident of reaching a deal. She said that, while the UK should aim to secure a withdrawal agreement as soon as possible, this would not be done at any cost. “The prime minister said that, once agreement was reached on a withdrawal agreement, it remains the case that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and it will be subject to securing an acceptable full future framework.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, who supports a second referendum on Brexit, said the backstop deal was likely to leave the entire UK subject to EU rules indefinitely.“We are leaving the EU, but we are going to place ourselves in a relationship with the EU where we lose all influence over decision-making, and are likely to be subservient to the EU in critical areas about the nature of our future trading relationship with them, or for that matter the nature of the relationship that Northern Ireland has with them,” he told the BBC.“It really reinforces for me why we should have a people’s vote. What is going to end up being offered to the British public – and the government is going to seek to carry through parliament – is something markedly different from what was being discussed in 2016.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty ImagesGroundbreaking campaigns have broken barriers this election, with historic candidates changing the face of Congress and statehouses across the US. Women have run in record numbers, and Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, millennials and LGBT candidates have already made history with their campaigns.Here are the key trailblazing candidates who are ersifying American politics and have already won their races so far. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, youngest woman elected to Congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise victory in the June congressional primary in New York shook up Washington and the Democratic party. The progressive challenger and member of the Democratic socialist party unseated a powerful 10-term New York congressman, running with a campaign ad that said: “Women like me aren’t supposed to run for office.”Now age 29, she has become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Elise Stefanik previously held the record when she was elected to Congress at age 30 in 2014.Ocasio-Cortez is the daughter of a Puerto Rican mother and a Bronx-born father and grew up in a working-class community. She ran a grassroots campaign that took on the “Queens Democratic party machine” and championed progressive proposals, such as the abolition of the Immigration Customs Enforcement (Ice), a single-payer healthcare plan and tuition-free college.Ayanna Pressley, first black House member from Massachusetts Pressley was the first black woman to serve on Boston’s city council and made history again after defeating the 10-term incumbent Michael Capuano in the primary. She did not face a challenger in the general election, making her the first black member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts.In her victory speech in September, she said: “These times demanded more from our leaders and from our party. These times demanded an approach to governing that was bold, uncompromising and unafraid. It’s not just good enough to see the Democrats back in power but it matters who those Democrats are.”Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, first Muslim congresswomen Tlaib ran unopposed in her race to represent Michigan’s 17th district and has become the nation’s first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, and one of two Muslim women elected on Tuesday.She is a Democratic-Socialist who served on the state legislature from 2009 to 2014 and ran her congressional primary campaign supporting Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing ICE. Tlaib was famously escorted from a Trump rally in 2016 as she shouted questions at the candidate, asking him if he had ever read the constitution.Ilhan Omar, also the first Somali-American in Congress, is a former refugee who spent the last four years as a state legislator. There, she pushed a progressive agenda, including a $15 minimum wage and subsidizing higher education costs for low-income students.Her congressional platform has included the cancellation of student debt, banning private prisons and aggressive funding cuts to military spending. In 2016, she became the first Somali-American state legislator in the country.Jared Polis, first openly gay man elected governor As the Democratic nominee for governor in Colorado, Polis ran on a leftwing platform, which included single-payer healthcare, repeal of the death penalty, universal full-day preschool and stronger gun laws. Polis, who declared victory late Tuesday night, has long been outspoken in favor of marijuana legalisation.Kate Brown, who is bisexual, became the first openly LGBT person elected governor in 2016 when she won her Oregon race. Jim McGreevey, a Democrat and former New Jersey governor, came out while in office in 2004.Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland, first Native American congresswome An attorney and former MMA fighter, Davids became the first Native American congresswoman and the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas.Raised by a single mother army veteran and a member of the Wisconsin-based Ho-Chunk Nation, Davids was a fellow in the Obama White House.Deb Haaland is a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe. In New Mexico, Deb Haaland became the first Native American woman to chair a state political party. Now, the former Democratic chair has also become the first Native American congresswoman in the US, alongside Davids. A citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, Haaland is a longtime activist who ran on a progressive platform, including Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, and the impeachment of Trump.Marsha Blackburn, first female senator from Tennessee A Republican who represents Tennessee’s 7th congressional district, Blackburn has become the first female senator in the state. Her race received national attention after the pop star Taylor Swift, who previously avoided politics, endorsed Blackburn’s opponent, the Democratic former governor Phil Bredesen. Blackburn has been closely aligned with Trump and is farther to the right than the GOP senator she is replacing. – Will there be a backlash against Trump?

But speaking to activists at Democratic Headquarters in Washington she also promised a new spirit of bipartisanship “because we’ve all had enough of ision”.In a significant blow to the party, however, Democrats failed to flip any of the toss-up seats that could have opened a path to victory in the Senate. With many districts still reporting late on Tuesday, Republicans may in fact add to their current Senate majority of 51-49 when the final results are known.Tweeting from the White House where he was watching the election coverage with friends and family, President Trump tweeted: “Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!”In an excruciatingly close contest in Florida, Republican candidates narrowly won the gubernatorial race and were expected to win the senate seat. Andrew Gillum narrowly missed his bid to become the state’s first African-American governor, while current governor Rick Scott was ahead of Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, with 99 per cent of the votes counted.Similarly in Texas, despite pulling ahead in early polls, Democrat Beto O’Rourke failed to unseat incumbent Republican Ted Cruz, although his strong performance gave hope to Democrats who have long hoped that changing demographics in America’s second-largest state could turn Texas blue.As predicted, Democrats performed strongly in House contests, picking up dozens of Republican seats around the country. Early results show that suburban America voted Democrat overwhelmingly, even in traditional Republican areas, suggesting a frustration with the politics represented by Donald Trump.Women candidates also outperformed. In Pennsylvania alone - a state with no female candidates currently in Congress - four Democratic women won House seats: Chrissy Houlahan, Mary Gay Scanlon, Susan Wilde and Madeleine Dean.However, the Senate race was less positive for Democrats.As expected, Democratic incumbents in states won by Donald Trump came under pressure. Democratic senator Joe Donnelly lost his seat to Mike Braun in Indiana. President Trump campaigned with Mr Braun on the eve of the election. However, Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the Democratic exception - succeeding in securing a second term despite running in a state that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump in 2016.Other toss-up races did not fall Democrats’ way. Despite hopes that Phil Bredesen could win the seat being vacated by Tennessee’s outgoing Republican senator Bob Corker - a frequent critic of Donald Trump - ultimately the seat was won by Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn.Democrats were also on track to win several governor races, including the governor’s seat in Republican-leaning Kansas and Michigan. However, the governors’ mansions in Ohio and Florida stayed in Republican hands in a setback for Democrats.Election night also contained some significant firsts. Jared Polis has become America’s first openly gay governor after winning the Colorado gubernatorial race. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the youngest woman ever elected to Congress after winning the 14th congressional district of New York as predicted.In Kansas, Sharice Davids, an openly gay political newcomer, beat four-term incumbent Kevin Yoder in the third congressional district. She will become the first native American woman to serve in Congress.Speaking at Democratic Headquarters in Washington DC shortly after 11.30 pm on Tuesday, Ms Pelosi hailed Democrats’ decisive victory in the House, and she praised volunteers who “refused to stand still”.“Tomorrow will be a new day in America,” she said, congratulating the “dynamic erse candidates who have taken back the House for the American people.”Will there be a backlash against Trump?

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Private schools could also share facilities such as science laboratories with nearby state schools, it adds, while teachers from fee-paying institutions could share lesson plans and resources.The new guidance comes against a backdrop of growing pressure on the country’s most prestigious private schools to step up their efforts to help less well-off pupils.Three quarters of independent schools in England are registered as charities, earning them favourable business rates and VAT exemptions on fees.To qualify as a charity they must demonstrate that they provide “public benefit” to a reasonably wide section of the public, rather than to a narrow group of wealthy iniduals.Private schools outscore state schools for the top gradesTraditionally this has been done by offering bursaries and fee discounts to children from disadvantaged families. However, many private schools now enter into partnerships with local state schools, which can include sharing teachers in specialist subjects or opening up their sports facilities.Last month, the Education Secretary told private schools to open up their swimming pools to local primaries as part of a new Government plan to boost swimming lessons.Damian Hinds called on private schools to help children from neighbouring state primaries learn to swim by allowing them to use their sports facilities.Just over half of private schools already share their facilities with other schools, as well as some offering coaches to local primary schools.  Lord Agnew, the schools minister, said: “When organisations across the education sector work together the positive impact on pupils can be huge – raising aspirations and unlocking young people’s potential. So much good work already goes on but I want to see more of it.”Ministers have backed down on proposals to scrap the charitable status of private schools that do not help out their state-school neighbours.A schools green paper and the Conservative election manifesto said that independent schools would be required to sponsor academies, forge formal partnerships with state schools or offer a significant number of bursaries to poorer children to retain their tax status.However, the plan has been quietly dropped and the DfE has since set up a new unit to facilitate partnerships between state and private schools.   Julie Robinson, general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, said: The vast majority of independent schools have established partnership projects with state schools, at varying levels according to their capacity, for the benefit of all involved.Through partnership work, we encourage all schools to continue supporting teacher training opportunities, sharing governance expertise and enriching the curriculum so that more children can thrive.”State schools are encouraged to sign a memorandum of understanding with their private school counterpart, where they enter into a formal agreement about their commitments. The DfE guidance also encourages universities to help struggling local state schools by for example, mentoring pupils who want to progress into higher education or training teachers.   Department for EducationPlease review our commenting policyUS midterm results and maps: Find out how each state voted and what losing the House means for Donald TrumpUS midterm election results live: Democrats win House but Republicans hold Senate - latest newsHouse of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpUS midterm elections 2018: Why these congressional elections matter House of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpTed Cruz beats Beto O\u0026#39Rourke to win midterm senate race in Texas How the balance of power in the US Senate could change after today\u0026#39s midterm electionsComment: Midterm results offer Donald Trump a populist path to 2020 victory\u0026#39Gammon\u0026#39 is added to Collins Dictionary as word of the yearRoyal Conservatoire principal: Music tuition fees in schools are pushing Scotland over cultural \u0026#39cliff edge\u0026#39Beto O\u0026#39Rourke: The skateboarding Democrat who narrowly lost to Ted Cruz in battle for TexasTed Cruz, the supreme politician with eyes on the White HouseUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Which party will win the race for Congress?Rashida Tlaib: Meet the Democrat who will be one of first two Muslim women in Congress US midterm results and exit polls: When will we know the election outcome and what are the states to watch?Democrats 2020: Could Bernie Sanders, America\u0026#39s Jeremy Corbyn, finally make it to the top? US midterm elections 2018 live: Results of first exit polls amid record turnout - latest newsFor Donald Trump and the Republicans something is rotten in the suburbs of Virginia Children most at risk of being stabbed on their way home from school, study suggests We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/06/TELEMMGLPICT000178916995_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoNNSexKcI53-HHJW8z5oHN2zu8eE3xlap_UxrZYPcsw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green faces three new us harassment claims","story":"Sir Philip Green faces three new US harassment claimsThree more women in America have come forward to make claims of sexual harassment against Sir Philip Green despite a “gag” on alleged British victimsFormer employees of Topshop have told the  that the businessman “slapped” their bottoms, grabbed their waists and made comments about their weight when they worked for the organisation.One former staff member claimed he once put his hand under her dress to squeeze her bottom while posing for a photograph at a promotional event.

If it means that I grow a little too fervid, or perhaps even hyperbolic, in extolling my native land, I admit the full justice of my remark,” the character says.“I am proud of this free and happy country. My form dilates, my eye glistens, my breast heaves, my heart swells, my bosom burns, when I call to mind her greatness and her glory.”Other words newly included in Collins’ online edition include ‘#MeToo’ and ‘gaslight’. ‘Single-use’, referring to the plastics littering our oceans, is also on the list - its impact was highlighted by the BBC’s Blue Planet II series.Helen Newstead, Head of Language Content at Collins, said: “This has been a year where awareness and often anger over a variety of issues has led to the rise of new words and the revitalisation and adaptation of old ones.“It’s clear from this year’s Words of the Year list that changes to our language are dictated as much by public concern as they are by sport, politics, and playground fads.”One more lighthearted word on the list is ‘plogging’, a Swedish activity that combines litter-picking while running (it merges the words ‘jogging’ and ‘plocka’, Swedish for ‘to pick’).Collins Dictionary Words of the Year 2018US midterm results and maps: Find out how each state voted and what losing the House means for Donald TrumpUS midterm election results live: Democrats win House but Republicans hold Senate - latest newsHouse of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpUS midterm elections 2018: Why these congressional elections matter House of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpTed Cruz beats Beto O\u0026#39Rourke to win midterm senate race in Texas How the balance of power in the US Senate could change after today\u0026#39s midterm electionsComment: Midterm results offer Donald Trump a populist path to 2020 victoryRoyal Conservatoire principal: Music tuition fees in schools are pushing Scotland over cultural \u0026#39cliff edge\u0026#39Beto O\u0026#39Rourke: The skateboarding Democrat who narrowly lost to Ted Cruz in battle for TexasTed Cruz, the supreme politician with eyes on the White HouseUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Which party will win the race for Congress?Rashida Tlaib: Meet the Democrat who will be one of first two Muslim women in Congress US midterm results and exit polls: When will we know the election outcome and what are the states to watch?Democrats 2020: Could Bernie Sanders, America\u0026#39s Jeremy Corbyn, finally make it to the top? US midterm elections 2018 live: Results of first exit polls amid record turnout - latest newsFor Donald Trump and the Republicans something is rotten in the suburbs of Virginia Children most at risk of being stabbed on their way home from school, study suggests Mother of Grenfell bonfire suspect describes the footage as \u0026#39disgusting\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/06/TELEMMGLPICT000180041442_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"house representatives role responsibilities democrats can","story":"Historically, the president\u0026#39s party routinely loses House seats in the midterms - and this year is no exceptionThe Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, delivering a bitter blow for Donald Trump after a campaign that became a referendum on his leadership.The Republican Party went into Tuesday\u0027s elections in control of the chamber with a 43-seat majority.

It indicates many of the president\u0027s supporters are still with him two years into office.  Projections suggested the Republicans could even increase their majority in the Senate, allowing them to push ahead with controversial judicial and cabinet appointments with less fear of rebellions. Mr Trump, quick to put his spin on a night of mixed results, tweeted: “Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!”  Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: “Anybody that was anticipating a blue wave tonight is not going to get it.In some of the most closely watched races, Democrats lost out.  Beto O\u0027Rourke, who had become a pinup for American liberals by running a surprisingly competitive race in Texas, ultimately fell short, with Ted Cruz winning re-election as the state\u0027s senator. The Republicans held the Senate after the midtermsAndrew Gillum, the left-leaning Democrat who was hoping to become Florida’s first ever black governor, was also defeated, narrowly losing to Trump acolyte Ron DeSantis.  A number of historic landmarks were reached, with the first Muslim congresswoman, first openly gay male governor and the youngest ever congresswoman (aged 29) all being elected.The story of the night was that of two different battles playing out – one for control of the House and another for the Senate.  In the House races, all eyes were on America’s suburbs. Democrats quickly made gains but failed to pick off seats which would have indicated they were on course for a landslide. The US midterm elections 2018, in picturesOne Republican senator close to Mr Trump, Lindsey Graham, admitted the party would have to address its “suburban women problem” as the Democrats gained seats. Their control of the House will be a huge headache for Mr Trump. His legislative agenda will grind to a hold, with the chances of securing new funding for his US-Mexico border or another tax cut significantly diminished. The White House is also braced for Democrat-controlled House committees to launch many probes that could damage the president on everything from his tax returns to ties to Russia, using their power to order witnesses to testify.  Nancy Pelosi, the woman expected to become the new Democrat Speaker of the House, said in a celebratory speech that Wednesday would be a “new day in America”, adding: “We’ve all had enough of ision.” However in the Senate, it was a different story. Here just a third of senators were up for re-election and the map heavily favoured Republicans, with many Democrats running in states Mr Trump won in 2016.  In the end, Republicans appeared on course to exceed expectations. Democrat incumbents were ousted in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, while Republicans held seats in Tennessee and Texas. With some states still to call, it was certain Republicans would hold the Senate majority and likely they would increase it by a few seats – a win which the president is sure to seize upon.  Mr Trump was credited with energising his voters, countering the enthusiasm displayed by the Democrats.It meant any hopes of a historic landslide from Mr Trump’s opponents soon faded as results filtered in. Mr Graham said Mr Trump should be “proud” of firing up his base, adding: “President Trump is well on his way to getting re-elected.”The Democrats\u0027 gains tonight have big implications for the Russia investigation, and for Silicon Valley, writes Laurence Dodds.Being in control of the House of Representaitves gives Democrats the power to appoint committee heads. Previously, the House intelligence committee was chaired by Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist who has continually battled the Mueller investigation and who has received campaign donations from executives at Oracle, one of the more Right-leaning tech companies. Now it will be Adam Schiff, a Democrat who has been much more outspoken about the Valley\u0027s role in misinformation. (Mr Schiff has also received donations from Oracle, but not from the executives who gave to Mr Nunes.) He has called on companies such as Facebook and Twitter to hire more moderators to police their services, and accused them of doing the minimum amount necessary to handle the problem. He has also warned that more needs to be done to stop foreign interference and that social media companies must go against their economic interests to be good corporate citizens. When the US Senate called Mark Zuckerberg and other tech titans to testify earlier this year, it made headlines. Perhaps now the House will seek a bigger piece of the action.Of the remaining seven Senate seats yet to be called, four are classed as toss-ups: Arizona, Florida, Montana and Nevada. Florida and Montana are projected to turn Republican, according to US networks, as the Democrat incumbents struggle to hold on in states Donald Trump won in 2016.In the House, the Democrats have won at least 208 seats with more than 30 still to be counted.An estimated 114 million votes were cast in the House election, smashing the 83 million cast in 2014 according to the New York Times. Senate results currently show that 40.7 million votes have been cast for the Democrats while the Republicans have 31.6 million. These numbers may change as more results come in through the morning.Beto O\u0027Rourke gave an emotionally charged concession speech at his election night event at a baseball stadium in El Paso, Texas, Nick Allen writes.Mr O\u0027Rourke said he had called Ted Cruz to congratulate him and quieted boos from the crowd at the mention of Mr Cruz\u0027s name. He said he had promised to help Mr Cruz in any way possible to represent Texas. To a large cheer Mr O\u0027Rourke then told his supporters: I\u0027m so f------ proud of you guys.He added: No-one thought this was possible to create a campaign for people from all walks of life. This campaign has a special place in the history of this country. I\u0027m forever change in the most profoundly positive way. I believe in you, I believe in Texas, I believe in this country.I\u0027m as inspired, I am as hopeful as I have ever been in my life. This country is in no way diminished at this moment. I know we will continue to work to come together. To chants of Beto, Beto he left open the possibility of a future electoral campaign. I love you more than words can express, he said. We\u0027ll see you out there down the road. Mr O\u0027Rourke left the stage to John Lennon\u0027s Imagine. Some of his supporters left the baseball stadium in tears.In a night of political firsts, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar have become the first two Muslim women to be elected to the US Congress. Ms Tlaib called Donald Trump\u0027s election a bat signal for women when I interviewed her last month, you can read the full piece here.Kristi Noem has become South Dakota\u0026#39s first female governorElsewhere, Democrat Janet Mills was elected Maine\u0027s first female governor, defeating Republican Shawn Moody and putting seat back in Democratic hands. South Dakota also voted in its first female state governor with Republican Kristi Noem defeating Democrat Billie Sutton. New Mexico Democrat Deb Haaland and Kansas Democrat Sharice Davids were elected the first two Native American women to serve in Congress.Women will break the current record of 84 serving at the same time in the House of Representatives.With ballots still being counted across the country, women have won 75 seats and are assured of victory in nine districts where women are the only major-party candidates.The majority of gains are among the Democrats. From the Women\u0027s March opposing President Donald Trump the day after his inauguration in January 2017, through a stream of sexual assault accusations later that year that sparked the #MeToo movement, outrage and organising by women have defined Democratic Party politics this election cycle.More than 230 women, many of them first-time candidates, were on the general-election ballots in House races.Despite the gains, men will continue to hold the vast majority of House seats.I’m at an election night party in a cinema in Oakland, California, a liberal neighbour city of San Francisco where the Black Panthers once had their stronghold.It would be hard to find a pro-Trump party in this city, but California in general is not just a lock for the Democrats. Republicans are defending the 10th House district, east of San Jose, and the 25th, where the Republican incumbent had distanced himself from his party’s hard line on immigration. Other blue targets include Orange County outside Los Angeles, which has become competitive due to the arrival of more Asian and Latino Americans, and the 50th district outside San Diego, where Republican Duncan Hunter was made vulnerable by allegations of misusing campaign funds.In the cinema, there were huge cheers and whoops for Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who look very likely to become the first Muslim women in Congress. Ms Omar came to America decades ago as a refugee from Somalia, while Tlaib is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants.There were also loud boos for the narrow victory of Ron DeSantis over Andrew Gillum in the race to be governor of Florida – and for Diane Feinstein, the Democrat who many Leftists feel is not too centrist (My girlfriend observes: “It’s like a pantomime!”).“We’ve been so much on the defensive, so hopefully this puts us in a position if being more offensive, more strategic,” said Democrat supporter Emma Ishii.It could be some time yet before we know the outcome of the Senate race here in Nevada, Rob Crilly writes. This was supposed to be the big seat for Democrats - a state they won in 2016 giving them the best chance of unseating a Republican incumbent. But we already know that Republicans will hold the Senate, whatever the result here.Voting was supposed to finish almost two hours ago. But there were long lines at polling centres, delaying the close of voting.Dean Heller, the Republican senator, just addressed his supporters here in Las Vegas, thanking the president for making multiple visits to Nevada.“Our message is good,” he said. “Our message here in America is good. Look at what this economy is doing thanks to this president and this Republican Congress that put American and Nevada back to work.”Republican Josh Hawley wins Missouri Senate race, ousting Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill. Another heavy loss for the Democratic party in the Senate.It was as much relief as celebration, Rob Crilly writes. After days of quietly fearing the worst, Republicans in Nevada are beginning to think this could be a good night.  The quiet hum at their party in the South Point Hotel and Casino in Law Vegas gave way to whoops and cheers as Fox News called the Texas Senate race for Ted Cruz, which effectively means the party retains control of the Senate.Depending on how our local races go, this could be a good night, said Joe Ludwig, who works in medical customer services. Just breaking even feels good at this stage. There\u0027s no wave and a few extra seats in the Senate could help the president, even if he loses the House.Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in the House, is speaking at the party\u0027s headquarters in Washington. We\u0027ve all had enough of ision, she says to loud cheers. Mrs Pelosi went on to promise accountability, saying Democrats will strive for bipartisanship.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi arrives to celebrate Democratic House wins“Thanks to you we owned the ground,” she says. “Thanks to you tomorrow will be a new day in America. Remember this feeling. Note the power to win.”Donald Trump has praised the tremendous success for his Republican party in tonight\u0027s results. However the White House has called a lid for pool reporters, meaning the president will not speak tonight. Andrew Gillum has conceded defeat in Florida\u0027s governor race against Republican Ron DeSantis, in what was one of the most vicious campaigns of the year.  Mr Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor, had been hoping to become the state\u0027s first African American governor. The bitter campaign had included accusations of dog whistle politics, but Donald Trump made several trips to the state to stump for Mr DeSantis.This is an important result for Mr Trump, Florida is America\u0027s most populous swing state and governors have huge sway over mobilising party activists and raising donations for the 2020 presidential race.The Texas senate result was called while a band was on stage at Beto O\u0027Rourke\u0027s election night party, Nick Allen reports. The crowd was listening to an accordionist as news spread by way of social media on phones. When the band finished a silence fell. There were some, rather half-hearted chants of Beto, Beto.It was a shock for a lot of the first-time voters who had packed into a baseball stadium in El Paso firmly believing their candidate was about to pull off an historic upset. Not long before the race was called Ted Cruz\u0027s campaign had indicated they thought they were in for a long night. When the result came his supporters at an event in Houston burst into chants of We want Ted! We want Ted!Democrat Heidi Heitkamp has lost her senate seat in North Dakota, losing to Republican Kevin Cramer. This was a crucial target for Republicans in a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Ms Heitkamp became one of the most endangered Democrats in the Senate after she voted against Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s Supreme Court nomination.Many of tonight\u0027s results were predictable. The Democrats have done well in the House, which was inevitable given Trump’s low approval rating, two years of controversy and the continued shift of suburban voters to the Democratic column. But the Republicans have also done well in the Senate – in part thanks to Democrats defending incumbencies in states that favoured Trump (Indiana, North Dakota etc). In other words, the Republicans have had luck and math on their side.One notable exception is here in Pennsylvania where it looks like the Republicans have been cut down from 15 out of 18 House seats to a paltry 6. This was due in part to a court-ordered redistricting.Both sides will have to confront substantial challenges. Would the Democrats have done even better if they had moved to the centre? It has been suggested that Beto O’Rourke could have won Texas if he had courted Ted Cruz’s voters, but he didn’t. He went pro-immigration, pro-impeachment, pro-gun control. As for the Republicans, what do they do about Trump? He has identified and energised a populist coalition that snagged him the presidency – but he has also placed limits on where the Republicans can win state-by-state. The exit polls suggest large parts of the country resent his rhetoric on immigration and feel the country is headed in the wrong direction. Given that the economy is so strong, they presumably mean it is becoming too isive and violent.We’ll see where things stand in the morning. I’m going to try to sleep but there’s a party in the tavern downstairs. I’m using CNN as white noise to drown it out.I\u0027ve arrived at the Republican election night party in Las Vegas. It\u0027s the same place they saw in the 2016 election result - I wonder if they are superstitious. There\u0027s a degree of realism in the air. Most expect to lose the House tonight. But limiting Democrats to a majority of 15 or fewer, and holding the Senate would go down as a good result.Rising left-wing rock star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made history on Tuesday as the youngest woman elected to Congress, in a safe Democratic Party stronghold in New York.The 29-year-old has championed her working class and Puerto Rican roots, moonlighting as a bartender until defeating a Democratic grandee in a party primary earlier this year, capturing imaginations around the country.On Tuesday, she trounced Republican opponent Anthony Pappas in her constituency, a Democratic stronghold in a erse part of Queens and the Bronx.The \u0027s US Editor, Ben Riley-Smith, spent a day out on the campaign trail with her earlier this year. Read his profile of the young Congresswoman here.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to CongressMs Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s win beats the previous record held by Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a former White House aide to president George W Bush who was first elected to an upstate New York constituency in 2014 aged 30.Before that, the last record was last set by former Democratic representative Elizabeth Holtzman in Brooklyn, who won a seat in the House in 1972 when she was 31 years old and took her seat in 1973.Women occupy just 23 percent of the seats in the current US Senate and 19.3 percent in the House of Representatives, comparatively low rates in the developed world.Republican Ted Cruz has held onto his senate seat in Texas, defeating Democratic challenger Beto O\u0027Rourke. Democrat Jared Polis has been elected Colorado\u0027s governor, defeating Republican Walker Stapleton. Mr Polis is the country\u0027s first openly gay male governor.Having picked up two new Senate seats, NBC is predicting the Republican will maintain their control of the chamber. Meanwhile Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is projected to lose her senate seat in North Dakota. If this is true, it extremely unlikely the Democrats can take the Senate.Republican Mitt Romney has won a senate seat in Utah after returning to front line politics, defeating Democrat Jenny Wilson. Mr Romney has been something of a thorn in Donald Trump\u0027s side, frequently criticising the president in public.Mitt Romney has regularly criticised the presidentHe ran against Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election and took a back seat from national politics for a while after his defeat.Speaking outside the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared to be conceding Republicans may have lost control of the House. Asked about that possibility of a Democratic takeover, she said: The president\u0027s agenda isn\u0027t going to change regardless of whose party is there.Three Democratic senators have held onto their seats.Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has won a second term, defeating Republican Leah Vukmir Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has won a third term, defeating Republican Jim Newberger and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico has also won re-election, defeating Republican Mick Rich. Nick Allen has an update from Texas:With 58 per cent of the vote in Ted Cruz and O’Rourke both have more than 2 million votes - and O’Rourke is ahead...by just 79. This could be an absolute nailbiter.The suburbs of Houston are still to come in and could be good for the Democrat. But Cruz has been campaigning a lot there, and he lives in Houston. He’s also got a lot of reliably red rural areas to come in.O’Rourke has hired out a baseball stadium in El Paso for his election party. Supporters, many of them very young, are pouring in to the stands and a DJ is playing on a stage erected on the outfield. It’s an untraditional election night event.The USA appears – touch wood – to have made it through the midterms without a major cyberattack targeting election infrastructure, Laurence Dodds writes.Matthew Prince, chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Cloudflare, said his company hadn\u0027t seen any such incidents. Perhaps it helped that the Pentagon had given US government hackers authority to retaliate against any nation which attempted one.But the vote has not been free of foreign information operations – that is, political campaigns run using deceptive methods such as bots, fake accounts and false identities. Although most such activity now comes from Americans, Facebook said this morning that it had blocked around 30 accounts after a tip-off from authorities involving foreign entities. Separately, an app created by the comedian Samantha Bee which allows users to report attempts at voter suppression has received 800 such reports, including claims of vigilantes hanging around the polls trying to intimidate people.Fox News has projected a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Whether this projection, so early in the night, will hold true remains to be seen.Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly has lost his senate seat in Indiana, the home state of Vice President Mike Pence. The winner, Republican Mike Braun, has picked up another crucial seat for his party. This was a key target for the Republicans and Mr Trump campaigned in the state multiple times, returning again on his final day of rallies on Monday.Early results are showing the Republicans holding on to some House seats Democrats had hoped to flip, suggesting the predicted \u0027blue wave\u0027 is failing to materialise.Republican businessman Bill Lee is elected Tennessee governor, defeating Democratic former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean. But in Illinois, Democrat JB Pritzker has managed to unseat the incumbent Republican governor Bruce Rauner. In more predictable results, Republican Greg Abbott of Texas, Democrat Andrew Cuomo of New York, Democrat Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania re-elected and Republican Larry Hogan of Maryland were all re-elected as state governors. Republican Mark Gordon will by Wyoming\u0027s next governor. Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming has been  re-elected to the Senate. Democrat Bob Casey of Pennsylvania has won a third Senate term, beating Republican challenger Lou Barletta.  Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi has also won re-election, defeating Democrat David Baria.Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has been re-elected in West Virginia, defeating Republican challenger Patrick Morrisey. This was the most pro-Trump state of the 2016 election, and a key target for Republicans this year. This is a personal loss for Mr Trump, who campaigned in the state multiple times in the run up to Tuesday\u0027s election. Democrat senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been re-elected in New York. Ms Gillibrand has been touted as a future presidential candidate.Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey has been re-elected to third term, defeating Republican Bob Hugin. It was a surprisingly close race given the state is traditionally blue. Mr Hugin had distanced himself from the president, calling his plan to end birthright citizenship wrong. Greg Pence, the brother of Vice President Mike Pence, has been elected to Congress in Indiana. He was running in the Vice President\u0027s former seat in Indiana\u0027s 6th district, a staunchly Republican area.Polls have closed on America\u0027s east coast, with a number of battleground House and Senate races remaining competitive. What are the results so far?Democrat Sherrod Brown has been re-elected to the Senate in Ohio, defeating Republican Jim Renacci. In his victory speech, Mr Brown said his win should be “the blueprint for our nation in 2020” - prompting speculation about the 2020 presidential election.Republican Charlie Baker has been elected to serve a second term as Massachusetts governor. He defeated Democrat Jay Gonzalez, who was hoping to become the state\u0027s first Hiic governor. Elsewhere Republican Asa Hutchinson has won a second term as Arkansas governor, defeating Democrat Jared Henderson. In Rhode Island, Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo has won a second term, defeating Republican Allan Fung. Mr Fung was hoping to become the state\u0027s first Asian governor.This analysis from Joshua Wilson on our data team:According to the latest exit poll from CNN, the top issue on voters minds as they headed to the ballot box on Tuesday was health care, with 41 per cent of voters listing it as their top issue.Health care is the top issue for voters in this years mid termsIn previous years the economy has been the top issue which has played to the strengths of the Republicans, but health care favours the Democrats much more strongly and they have campaigned heavily on this topic. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Murphy of  Connecticut, Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, Tom Carper of Delaware, and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island have all been re-elected for another six-year term, according to the Associated Press.Democrats have seized a House seat in Virginia with Jennifer Wexton predictably defeating incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock. Virginia 10  is a district which Hillary Clinton won in 2016. This is a key signal of how the Democrats are going to fare in the suburbs. Our own Nick Allen visited Virginia 10 last week to see how Donald Trump\u0027s Republican party was going down with suburban, female, college-educated voters. Read his dispatch here.Elsewhere in Virginia, Tim Kaine, Mrs Clinton\u0027s running mate in 2016, has been re-elected to the Senate. Mr Kaine comfortably beat Republican Corey Stewart. Bernie Sanders, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, has been re-elected as a senator in Vermont. Mr Sanders ran as an independent candidate with the Democratic party\u0027s backing, as he has done in previous years.Bernie Sanders has been re-elected for another six-year term in the US SenatePresident Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are watching the results at the White House with friends and family.This in from Sarah Sanders, the White House Press Secretary:  “As President, Donald J Trump has headlined an unprecedented 50 rallies — 30 in the last two months alone — and he has campaigned for dozens of candidates at all levels of government. The President has energised a staggering number of Americans at packed arenas and in overflow crowds at rallies across the country.Under President Trump’s leadership, the Republican National Committee has raised more than a quarter billion dollars, fueling an extraordinary ground game geared toward defying midterm history and protecting the GOP’s majorities.He has made the choice clear to the American people: Tonight, we can continue down the path of American prosperity and security or we can go backwards. The President and First Lady look forward to watching the results come in with friends and family in the White House residence.” Please review our commenting policyUS midterm results and maps: Find out how each state voted and what losing the House means for Donald TrumpHouse of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpUS midterm elections 2018: Why these congressional elections matter House of Representatives: Role, responsibilities - and how Democrats can punish Donald TrumpTed Cruz beats Beto O\u0026#39Rourke to win midterm senate race in Texas How the balance of power in the US Senate could change after today\u0026#39s midterm electionsComment: Midterm results offer Donald Trump a populist path to 2020 victory\u0026#39Gammon\u0026#39 is added to Collins Dictionary as word of the yearRoyal Conservatoire principal: Music tuition fees in schools are pushing Scotland over cultural \u0026#39cliff edge\u0026#39Beto O\u0026#39Rourke: The skateboarding Democrat who narrowly lost to Ted Cruz in battle for TexasTed Cruz, the supreme politician with eyes on the White HouseUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Which party will win the race for Congress?Rashida Tlaib: Meet the Democrat who is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress for the first time US midterm results and exit polls: When will we know the election outcome and what are the states to watch?Democrats 2020: Could Bernie Sanders, America\u0026#39s Jeremy Corbyn, finally make it to the top? US midterm elections 2018 live: Results of first exit polls amid record turnout - latest newsFor Donald Trump and the Republicans something is rotten in the suburbs of Virginia Children most at risk of being stabbed on their way home from school, study suggests We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg","title":"apple macbook air review best laptops 2018 specs price display battery","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsThe latest Apple laptop is gorgeous and capable\u0026nbsp– and a fitting update to a successful favouriteClick to followThe Independent TechThe MacBook Air\u0026nbspchanged how people saw lightweight laptops when it was first announced 10 years ago, revealed when then Apple CEO Steve Jobs slid it out of a manila envelope.It was very expensive then, but over the years, the original design became the entry-level Apple laptop.

That super-slim profile which sloped down to an impossibly thin edge? That\u0027s what this laptop looks like when the lid is closed. It\u0027s a little smaller in most directions. It used to be 32.5cm wide, now it\u0027s 30.41cm. Before, it was 22.7cm deep, but this has shrunk to 21.24cm and its height (its thickness when closed, in other words) has gone from 1.7cm to 1.56cm at its thickest. Note, though, that the thinnest measurement of all, that uncannily thin lip, has actually crept up from 0.3cm to 0.41cm now. In other words, it\u0027s smaller in every direction except at the very edge where it\u0027s all of 1.1mm thicker. Big deal. Oh, and it\u0027s dropped from 1.35kg to 1.25kg in weight.This means it\u0027s the lightest Apple laptop apart from the MacBook (0.92kg).The point is that compared to the previous MacBook Air it\u0027s improved, apart from a tiny bit extra on the thinnest measurement, which I defy anyone to notice. That\u0027s before we get to the colour, which was silver only until now. The new model also comes in space grey, as well as a fruity, peachy gold shade to the aluminium that continues to make up the laptop\u0027s structure.The Apple logo is no longer backlit, instead it\u0027s a reflective metallic apple, carefully colour-matched to the aluminium frame around it. This\u0026nbspbrings the MacBook Air into line with the design language of the other latest MacBook and MacBook Pro models.It looks tremendous, a perfect balance between small body size and big screen, thanks to the tiny bezel that runs round the display. This bezel is nothing compared to the wide silver frame around the display which was required when the first model arrived.The connectivity has been updated, too. There\u0027s no SD card slot, no USB-A ports and no wonderful MagSafe power connector. Only the headphone socket is carried over to the new laptop. What\u0027s new is the same Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connector found on the MacBook, used for data transfer and charging. Except this laptop has two of them, which is a very big improvement. It\u0027s not the super-useful four sockets that are found on the MacBook Pro, but it\u0027s a very welcome upgrade.The other visual difference is the trackpad, which is noticeably larger on this new laptop. And it\u0027s a Force Touch pad, that is, it gives the impression of moving when it\u0027s only a persuasive haptic feedback that\u0027s fooling your finger. This is one of the most noticeable changes to the laptop, once you\u0027ve stopped admiring the thin dark bezel and all-glass covering that succeeded the silver aluminium frame.The 13.3-inch screen is now –\u0026nbspfinally! –\u0026nbspa Retina display. Instead of the 128 pixels per inch (ppi) on previous similarly-sized MacBook Air screens, this has leapt to 227 ppi. To say this makes a difference is an understatement. Actually, it\u0027s more that if you used the MacBook Air, it was fine until you glanced at a recent MacBook or MacBook Pro with their glorious Retina displays, and then you simply didn\u0027t want to go back. Now, the MacBook Air has joined the Retina club.It\u0027s unquestionably the upgrade Air users waiting to replace their laptop have been aching for over the last few years. There are more colours available on this screen\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp48 per cent more, Apple says –\u0026nbspand in this respect also, the improved display is a big step forward.Since the display has been upgraded, you may very well want to watch video on it –\u0026nbspafter all, it\u0027s bigger than the largest iPad screen, and almost as high-resolution. So, you\u0027ll be glad of the improved audio. Apple says the new stereo speakers offer twice the bass and an extra 25 per cent of volume compared to the last model. I haven\u0027t measured it, you understand, but it absolutely sounds better and definitely loud. There are three microphones on board, which is useful because this laptop supports hands-free Siri, of which more later.It may look just like the old keyboard but wait until you try it. To be fair, the original MacBook Air keyboard was a sumptuously comfortable user experience which some feel has never been bettered. The new keyboard was clickier and noisier. This is the third-generation of the new butterfly-mechanism keyboard which is noticeably quieter than the second-gen. And, unlike the previous MacBook Air, this one is now in line with the other Apple laptops, with inidually backlit keys. Of course, you\u0027d expect the processor to be cutting-edge. It is, and although in everyday use the previous MacBook Air was perfectly fast enough, this is noticeably more capable and speedier, even down to simple things like opening files and launching apps. When I first saw the second-generation MacBook Air, all those years ago, I was told that battery life was excellent and plugging it in all day long just wasn\u0027t necessary. That\u0027s just as true today and in the week or so that I\u0027ve been testing the laptop, it\u0027s lasted more or less a full day with ease. Important in a laptop as portable as this one. The processor is powerful enough to let you talk to your computer. Say Hey, Siri from across the room and it\u0027ll respond. Only the most recent MacBook Pro models can match this. Although it lacks the super-cool Touch Bar of high-end MacBook Pro models, the MacBook Air has stolen another excellent feature: Touch ID. Nestled to the right of the function keys is a tiny, glossy square. Register your fingerprint and you can unlock it with one touch. This is a brilliantly intimate way to open your Mac, quicker and simpler than a password and only beaten for ease by unlocking with the Apple Watch. You can use Touch ID for Apple Pay, too, when you\u0027re paying for stuff online. It\u0027s made of aluminium. Well, that\u0027s normally not much of a thing to focus on. But this MacBook Air is the first Apple device to be made from 100 per cent recycled aluminium. The bits left over when other MacBooks, iPhones and iPad are created have been turned into this new laptop thanks to Apple metallurgists working on how to create a new alloy that can be re-used effectively. Note that the colour of the laptop is identical to the colours used in non-recycled Macs –\u0026nbspa sign of the success of this alloy. It means the carbon footprint is half that of the last MacBook. Apple uses smelting processes which are less harmful than some manufacturers in the first place, but now, with this laptop, no smelting has been necessary at all, which is a definite bonus for the environment.Which MacBook should you buy?That\u0027s an interesting question. The new MacBook Air sells for £1,199, that\u0027s £50 cheaper than the cheapest MacBook, which has a smaller display, older processor and lacks some of the best features of the new Air such as an extra USB-C socket, Touch ID and hands-free Siri. On the face of it, it\u0027s a no-brainer: why spend more for a less advanced machine?The only reason is portability –\u0026nbspthe MacBook is small and significantly lighter than the Air. You really feel the difference when you\u0027re holding both, though neither is exactly heavyweight. If you\u0027re happy with the weight of the Air (and pick it up in store to see for yourself) then the Air wins out in every other department, from its glorious screen to its extra speed and features. And if you want the cheapest MacBook of all, the Air with its previous design, is still available, for £949. This older model is likely to remain a keen choice for the budget-conscious for some time to come. Mind you, the new one is way better in every single respect (unless you really need an SD memory card slot, and –\u0026nbspyou know what? – there are dongles for that).Unless you need something super-light, the MacBook Air is the best choice. Unless you need advanced processing power that only the MacBook Pro can deliver, the MacBook Air is the best choice. The new model is pricier than the old, but it offers a great balance between power and portability. The new design is cute, especially the new gold finish, and the addition of Touch ID is a genuine advantage. Most of all, it\u0027s a reminder that in the last 10 years, not much has happened to overtake the design ethos of the MacBook Air, apart from a better screen, faster processor, slimmer bezel, better connectivity and improved security in the form of Touch ID. All of which are included here.The new MacBook Air was a hugely popular laptop. Goodness knows we\u0027ve been waiting a long time for this upgrade, but it\u0027s here, and Apple has delivered the goods.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Now a site in Gillingham in Kent will go, along with hundreds of jobs there.\u0026nbspA Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: “Lloyds Banking Group has today announced that it will create an additional c.2,000 roles, as it strengthens its capability to offer customers new leading-edge digital banking products and services.\u0026nbsp“The Group is investing to further digitise the bank and will refresh some existing roles and create new roles within its structure, while also providing comprehensive retraining for colleagues to help them build their capabilities to meet the demands of these future roles.Llouds said the latest announcement was part of a £3bn commitment it\u0026nbspmade to invest heavily in technology and staff.\u0026nbspLloyds reported\u0026nbsppretax\u0026nbspprofits of £1.8bn last quarter but is pressing on with plans to cut costs and adapt its business.Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said: “As the profits stack up for Lloyds, so does the uncertainty for loyal staff who work hard to serve customers. This latest announcement will undoubtedly hit the morale of staff who have had to endure round after round of job cuts, branch closures and constant upheaval.“The news of additional jobs will prove to be a bitter pill for workers at Lloyd’s Gillingham site closure. These hard working staff face limited opportunities for redeployment, while other workers around the country could effectively be forced out of a job because they are unable to travel or move to where the new roles are located.“Unite will be pressing Lloyds to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and ensuring that staff who move into new roles are given the support and skills that enable them to continue delivering the best possible customer service.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

ABF posted a 1 per cent rise in group revenue to £15.6bn, while pre-tax profit went up 5 per cent to £1.4m. The group reported that Primark “delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years” in the 12 months to 15 September, with retail revenue up 6 per cent at £7bn and operating profit up 15 per cent to £843m. ABF said the discount store performed particularly well in the UK, with like-for-like sales up 1.2 per cent. Success in its retail arm helped to offset continued decline in ABF’s sugar business, which has long been struggling due to falling sugar prices as a result of\u0026nbspthe EU removing sugar sales quotas. Shoppers evacuated as major blaze breaks out in Belfast PrimarkPrimark\u0027s own brand cosmetics now completely cruelty-freeGeorge Weston, chief executive of Associated British Foods, said: This was another year of progress for the group. We continued to pursue the opportunities to grow our businesses with a gross investment of £1.2bn. “Strong profit performances were delivered by each of Primark, grocery, agriculture and ingredients. These more than offset the decline in sugar profit which was caused primarily by low prices in the first year after the structural change in the EU sugar regime. Looking ahead, management have clear plans for further investment and for pursuing opportunities for business improvement.The company said it plans to focus investment in Primark, Twinings Ovaltine and its ingredients business, and expects profits to improve in retail and grocery, while sugar profits will be “significantly lower”. Meanwhile, the group said it will pay a idend of 45p for the year, marking a 10 per cent increase on the amount paid to shareholders in the previous 12 months. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at\u0026nbspFidelity Personal Investing’s share dealing service, said: “Associated British Foods has hit the sweet spot for investors again. Not with its sugar business but with fast-fashion brand Primark, whose performance has more than compensated for the fall in profits in its sugar business as a result of the deregulation of the EU sugar market.”“Primark has delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years and that’s especially sweet in a retail sector that has soured for so many other retailers. For many that 10 per cent rise in the annual idend for shareholders will just be the icing on the cake.”Shares in ABF were up more than 2 per cent in early trading.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, he said: “We have heard a number of times from university leaders that if they got into financial trouble then ‘they would be OK because the OfS would bail them out’. Professor criticised for saying Israelis blew up World Trade Center“This is wrong. This kind of thinking – not unlike the ‘too big to fail’ idea among the banks – will lead to poor decision-making and a lack of financial discipline.”Sir Michael told a conference of leaders in the university sector that bailouts would be “inconsistent” with the principle of university autonomy and it would not be in the “students’ longer-term interests”.His comments to vice-chancellors and management teams of higher education institutions come amid reports that a number of universities are on the verge of bankruptcy. Sir Michael called on institutions at risk of failure to be open about financial difficulties with the regulator before it is too late. “There will be no bailouts but there will be other solutions from A and B,” he said. Speaking to the press after his speech at Wonkfest, he said: “Universities are autonomous institutions largely – they are controlling their student numbers, their courses, whatever they put on. Sometimes they are borrowing money on the market to build buildings or whatever else they want to invest in. “If you make those decisions thinking ultimately you will be bailed out by the Office for Students, then you might make a different decision.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Adrian Lester, Sir Lenny Henry, Ade Adepitan, Nadine Marsh-Edwards, Marcus Ryder and Meera Syal, as they deliver a letter, signed by a string of stars, to 10 Downing Street, calling for tax breaks to effect change and boost ersity behind the cameraEU nationals, living in the UK take part in a demonstration along Whitehall.

But he said: “We do not see it as the government’s role to bail universities out when they make reckless financial decisions.”The University and College Union (UCU) said the regulator should not wash its hand of universities if things go wrong and argued institutions have a wider impact on jobs and opportunities in local areas. Matt Waddup, head of policy and campaigns at UCU, said: “In places like India and China they are opening new universities. Do the regulator and minister really want to voluntarily reduce our country’s intellectual, social and cultural capital?”He added: “Michael Barber’s comments demonstrate just how out of touch those in charge of our universities really are. “You don’t protect students’ interests by bringing about the demise of their local university. It would not simply be a case of students moving to another university if theirs were to experience financial trouble.”The UCU will be writing to MPs with a university in their constituency asking if they back plans to allow their institution to go bust. “The regulator and government should be supporting universities to excel, not washing their hands when things don’t go to plan,” Mr Waddup said.Office for StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sir Michael Barber, chair of the Office for Students (OfS), has called on universities in the UK not to avoid certain debates in seminars and lectures to “protect students” from difficult ideas.Students need be empowered to take points of views that are “minority” or “unpopular” and they should be taught how to “deal with discomfort, not run away from it”, he said.\u0026nbspFailing universities will not be bailed out, regulator warnsSpeaking at a conference on Tuesday, Sir Michael told leaders in the sector that one US university had a rule that “no student shall offend anyone on university property” – which he described as “absurd”.He said that\u0026nbspapproach was “the road to disaster”.Sir Michael said: “Universities need to be places where the pursuit of truth is not a platitude but a daily quest.

You create opportunities for people to have vigorous debate,” he said. Speaking at Wonkfest, Sir Michael also suggested that the “safe space” movement – originally intended to make vulnerable groups feel secure – did not help encourage freedom of speech when taken “too far”. Sam Gyimah, universities minister, who spoke at the same event, also warned that safe-space policies had “evolved into something completely different”. The minister said: “We can’t have the entire university as a safe space where certain views are welcome and certain views are not welcome.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Now a site in Gillingham in Kent will go, along with hundreds of jobs there.\u0026nbspA Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: “Lloyds Banking Group has today announced that it will create an additional c.2,000 roles, as it strengthens its capability to offer customers new leading-edge digital banking products and services.\u0026nbsp“The Group is investing to further digitise the bank and will refresh some existing roles and create new roles within its structure, while also providing comprehensive retraining for colleagues to help them build their capabilities to meet the demands of these future roles.Llouds said the latest announcement was part of a £3bn commitment it\u0026nbspmade to invest heavily in technology and staff.\u0026nbspLloyds reported\u0026nbsppretax\u0026nbspprofits of £1.8bn last quarter but is pressing on with plans to cut costs and adapt its business.Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said: “As the profits stack up for Lloyds, so does the uncertainty for loyal staff who work hard to serve customers. This latest announcement will undoubtedly hit the morale of staff who have had to endure round after round of job cuts, branch closures and constant upheaval.“The news of additional jobs will prove to be a bitter pill for workers at Lloyd’s Gillingham site closure. These hard working staff face limited opportunities for redeployment, while other workers around the country could effectively be forced out of a job because they are unable to travel or move to where the new roles are located.“Unite will be pressing Lloyds to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and ensuring that staff who move into new roles are given the support and skills that enable them to continue delivering the best possible customer service.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

I would be very afraid of the threat to the peace process, it was a dreadful time to live through. Even to go to mass on a Sunday, you’d have to go through checkpoints. It is terribly stressful,’ said Mullen. ‘All those barricades and boundaries were pulled down. I see it as a huge big exercise of trust and I do believe everyone breathed a sigh of relief’A bus stop and red post box stand in the border town of Jonesborough, Co Armagh14. Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It works by throwing out an array of 30,000 infrared lights, which hit the holder\u0027s face – a sensor in the camera can then see where they fall and check whether the right person is holding the phone.Cheaper, colourful version of latest iPhone finally goes on saleBut when the light is especially bright – on a sunny day, for instance – those invisible lights within the phone can get thrown off and the facial recognition sensor can have trouble seeing its owner.The new feature will improve that by better illuminating people\u0027s faces. The new sensor and its better lights will lower the impacts from visible lights of environment in order to improve the Face ID user experience, according to the report first spotted by\u0026nbspMacrumors.In addition to those new features, the updated version of the Face ID sensor could also allow it to use time of flight calculations to make 3D models of the things it is looking at. That technology works by throwing out a piece of light and seeing how long it takes to bounce back, and then using that to work out the distance – similar to something like radar.If Apple were to integrate that, it would allow the phone to use its modelling software to create augmented reality features to improve tools like the Animoji feature, for instance.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But as they scrambled to research it, the rock made its way out of the other side of our solar system, giving researchers only a glimpse to make the most of.In that short time, astronomers established that the object was moving strangely. It was spinning very quickly as it flew through the solar system, and seemed to speed up rather than slow down as it went.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

If so, that might have happened by accident – or the object might in fact be a spacecraft made by an alien race, they said.Alien asteroids could have brought life to Earth from spaceThe object might be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilisation, the researchers write.It is not the first time that astronomers have suggested the rock could potentially be an alien spacecraft. Soon after it was discovered, researchers with the Breakthrough Listen project announced they would be monitoring it and seeing if it was sending out radio signals.The new study, written by\u0026nbspShmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from the Harvard Smithsonian Centre\u0026nbspfor Astrophysics, looks at the way that solar radiation could be used to power the object as it flies through space. They calculate that it would have to be very thin but very wide – and that such a shape would be possible.If they are right that the object is being propelled by radiation pressure from the sun, then it will be a breakthrough even if it is entirely natural. Such an object would be of a kind never before seen, most likely formed by an entirely unknown process happening deep in space.But it might in fact be artificial in origin, they write. One\u0026nbsppossibility is that ‘Oumuamua\u0026nbspis a\u0026nbsplightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment, the authors claim, and it might be unused debris that has\u0026nbspbeen thrown out into space from a planetary system.Such an explanation would account for the various strange characteristics of Oumuamua, including the unusual shape it seems to have.Scientists on Earth have already looked to develop that kind of technology, which would be used to make tiny spacecraft that could be shot through space at intense speed and be pushed only by light. It might already have been developed elsewhere, they write, and could be used for transporting cargo between planets or even between stars.But even more strange is a theory that the rock could have been sent here on purpose. Alternatively, a more exotic scenario is that ‘Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization, they write.Oumuamua is now too far away from Earth for scientists to understand any more about it. But more could be found by looking into the solar system for more objects of this type, the authors say – which could happen more in coming years, as new ways of surveying the sky are turned on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Up yours, I thought...I get angry when I hear that word “empire” it reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised.”Responding to his candidacy for poet laureate, the poet, author, actor and musician\u0026nbsptweeted: “I have absolutely no interest in this job. I won’t work for them. They oppress me, they upset me, and they are not worthy.“I write to connect with people and have never felt the need to go via the church, the state, or the monarchy to reach my people. No money. Freedom or death.”The poet John\u0026nbspAgard\u0026nbsphas also criticised the way the laureate is chosen, telling the\u0026nbsp:\u0026nbsp“I’m certain that the prime minister is very familiar with the iambic pentameter. But since poets don’t have the final say in politics, logically speaking there’s no reason why politicians should have the final say in poetry.”Cope, who was strongly favoured when Andrew Motion was appointed in 1999, has also ruled herself out, having previously called for the position to be abolished in 2009.In her 10 years, Duffy – the first woman and the first Scot to hold the post – wrote poems to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch (the last two British soldiers to fight in\u0026nbspWWI), the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

ABF posted a 1 per cent rise in group revenue to £15.6bn, while pre-tax profit went up 5 per cent to £1.4m. The group reported that Primark “delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years” in the 12 months to 15 September, with retail revenue up 6 per cent at £7bn and operating profit up 15 per cent to £843m. ABF said the discount store performed particularly well in the UK, with like-for-like sales up 1.2 per cent. Success in its retail arm helped to offset continued decline in ABF’s sugar business, which has long been struggling due to falling sugar prices as a result of\u0026nbspthe EU removing sugar sales quotas. Shoppers evacuated as major blaze breaks out in Belfast PrimarkPrimark\u0027s own brand cosmetics now completely cruelty-freeGeorge Weston, chief executive of Associated British Foods, said: This was another year of progress for the group. We continued to pursue the opportunities to grow our businesses with a gross investment of £1.2bn. “Strong profit performances were delivered by each of Primark, grocery, agriculture and ingredients. These more than offset the decline in sugar profit which was caused primarily by low prices in the first year after the structural change in the EU sugar regime. Looking ahead, management have clear plans for further investment and for pursuing opportunities for business improvement.The company said it plans to focus investment in Primark, Twinings Ovaltine and its ingredients business, and expects profits to improve in retail and grocery, while sugar profits will be “significantly lower”. Meanwhile, the group said it will pay a idend of 45p for the year, marking a 10 per cent increase on the amount paid to shareholders in the previous 12 months. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at\u0026nbspFidelity Personal Investing’s share dealing service, said: “Associated British Foods has hit the sweet spot for investors again. Not with its sugar business but with fast-fashion brand Primark, whose performance has more than compensated for the fall in profits in its sugar business as a result of the deregulation of the EU sugar market.”“Primark has delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years and that’s especially sweet in a retail sector that has soured for so many other retailers. For many that 10 per cent rise in the annual idend for shareholders will just be the icing on the cake.”Shares in ABF were up more than 2 per cent in early trading.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Both in\u0026nbspinvolved people being barred\u0026nbspfrom entering the UK because officials were “not satisfied” they would return home.\u0026nbspBoth were reversed within 12 hours of the articles being published.\u0026nbspMan blocked from seeing baby after Home Office loses passportEU slavery victims at risk of re-exploitation after BrexitHome Office ‘risking repeat of Windrush scandal for EU citizens’Home Office stops US resident visiting seriously ill daughter in UKExperts\u0026nbsphave warned, however, that\u0026nbspthe speed at which the\u0026nbspdecisions are\u0026nbspreversed following media coverage\u0026nbspraises\u0026nbspserious concerns about the accuracy and fairness of the Home Office’s decision-making process.\u0026nbspIt amounts\u0026nbspto a “popularity contest” in which\u0026nbsponly those able to access journalists can\u0026nbspget their cases resolved, they said.\u0026nbspAmong the cases overturned after reporting by\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwas that of Yvonne Williams,\u0026nbspthe 59-year-old daughter of a Windrush generation\u0026nbspimmigrant who was served with a removal order despite\u0026nbspher whole family being in Britain.\u0026nbspThe decision to prevent\u0026nbspsix-year-old, UK-born Mohamed Bangoura\u0026nbspfrom returning home\u0026nbspto his mother following a holiday\u0026nbspwas also reversed, as was the case of Hafizzulah Husseinkhel, a\u0026nbsp27-year-old\u0026nbspAfghan man who was threatened with deportation despite having served in the British army.Journalists reporting on these cases are usually contacted\u0026nbspby either the inidual themselves, charities\u0026nbspsupporting them\u0026nbspor, increasingly, solicitors representing them. Immigration lawyers said media coverage was\u0026nbspnow often\u0026nbspthe only way to obtain a “fair and timely” resolution from the Home Office.Chai Patel, legal director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said that while it was good for inidual cases to get resolved, the process exposed a “completely dysfunctional” system which is\u0026nbsp“incredibly unfair” for those unable to get their cases in the media.He added:\u0026nbsp“It shows how little faith or consideration immigration officials have\u0026nbspin their\u0026nbspown decision-making that they’re willing to reverse them in a matter of hours, minutes sometimes, of them getting a bit of bad publicity.\u0026nbspAnd it’s seriously concerning that instead of having proper processes, we now have a popularity contest where, if you can get enough people to shout about your case, the Home Office will just change its mind.“Many will never get\u0026nbsptheir case\u0026nbspin the press because\u0026nbspit’s too sensitive,\u0026nbspor they don’t have the contacts or the lawyers to get in touch with journalists and\u0026nbspthey don’t have communities building campaign groups around them.Mr Patel said\u0026nbspeach Home Office U-turn\u0026nbspwas an admission\u0026nbspthat there is\u0026nbspno\u0026nbspsolution to the underlying problem whereby people are\u0026nbsp”consistently – almost as a matter of course – given entirely unfair decisions that will destroy their lives until they’re lucky enough to get them turned around”.Danielle Blake, a legal expert from\u0026nbspthe Immigration Advice Service (IAS), said it was a “big ask” for clients to willingly expose their personal circumstances to the world, but conceded that media exposure was often required to obtain a fair and timely resolution\u0026nbspfrom the Home Office.She added: “As advisers we come across many clients who are in the most desperate of situations. A\u0026nbsplot of them are separated from their loved ones and have been for a very long time. All of this adds several months onto an already long and emotionally draining process. It’s very upsetting to think that for those who wish to keep their story private, they face being stuck on a never-ending merry-go-round of paying exorbitant Home Office fees, only to come up against a brick wall of non-communication.”\u0026nbspWith Brexit on the horizon, campaigners raised concerns that an already “broken” system is going to be placed under even more pressure, with potentially disastrous implications.Mr Patel said: “The Home Office can’t function with the number of applications made currently. It’s going to get a lot worse when the government has to develop\u0026nbspan immigration system that includes EU nationals as well.\u0026nbspWhatever happens, the pressure on the Home Office both in terms of future migration and dealing with the people here already is going to be huge. To prevent disaster they need to completely reform every part of the immigration system, because currently it is completely broken.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The home secretary has been clear since his first day in office that he wants a different approach to the immigration system which provides control, but is fair and humane.\u0026nbspIf evidence about a case comes to light then it will be considered by caseworkers, but solely because a case is covered in the media does not mean it will receive a favourable decision.”Asylum and ImmigrationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Firstly, a withdrawal agreement – solving separation issues like Ireland, the orce bill\u0026nbspand citizens rights. But Theresa May has also promised a separate “political declaration” – a detailed outline of what Britain’s future trade relationship with the EU will look like, mostly on trade.It is this latter agreement that outlines whether Britain intends to join a customs union, follow single market\u0026nbsprules, or sign a free trade agreement – and whether to adopt models like Norway or Canada.\u0026nbspDelays and missed deadlines in negotiating the withdrawal agreement,\u0026nbspparticularly on the Irish border issue,\u0026nbsphowever means that negotiations about the nature of the future relationship have effectively not even started.To make matters worse, Theresa May’s opening Chequers proposal was rejected as unworkable by the EU’s 27 remaining countries, and the prime minister has said she will not accept any other offer on the table.Given the deadline to have everything agreed was October, it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how a substantial future relationship could be negotiated in time for the parliamentary vote.Hauliers face ‘lottery style’ allocation for permits under no-dealGovernment post-Brexit environment plans ‘do not replace all EU laws’May forced to call Varadkar to calm Irish anger over borderRemain would win new Brexit referendum by eight points, poll suggestsUnder laws passed by MPs earlier in the Brexit process, both the withdrawal agreement and political declaration must be presented to MPs before any vote can take place.Ahead of his meetings in Brussels, Sir Keir\u0026nbspsaid: “This is crunch time in the Brexit negotiations. Yet government isions and delays mean that little time has been spent debating what our future trading and security relationship will be after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“Months of deadlock in Theresa May’s government mean we’re facing continued uncertainty and the prospect of years of further negotiations over our future relationship with the EU.\u0026nbsp“A blind Brexit could prolong business uncertainty and provide insufficient guarantees to protect jobs, the economy and rights. Whether you voted Leave or Remain, nobody voted for the purgatory of permanent negotiations.“Theresa May and Dominic Raab promised that the Brexit deal put before parliament will be ‘detailed, precise and substantive’. That is exactly what Labour expects and what I will be discussing in Brussels. If the final deal it is anything less than the government has promised, Labour will not support it.”Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator will be out of town for this visit, attending a party conference in Finland.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The earlier referendum was held after negotiations were complete, so voters knew what they were voting for.“In 2016, the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown. Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative.“In the campaign, untestable claims took the place of facts and reality.”Human rights specialist Jonathan Cooper, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said: “The current state of the Brexit negotiations is worrying people throughout the UK and the legal profession is no exception to that.“We represent people from across industry and society and we see every day the way the prospect of a catastrophic Brexit deal is already causing real harm.“This letter to the prime minister has been signed by over a thousand of my colleagues who are convinced that not only is a people\u0027s vote the right thing to do, it is the most democratic thing to do as well.”A Department for Exiting the EU spokeswoman said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, Donald Trump threw his support behind Mr Cruz, stumping for the conservative senator in the final weeks of the election despite the two previously exchanging insults during the 2016 general elections.\u0026nbspFor a moment, it appeared as if Beto O\u0027Rourke had been officially projected to win the US Senate race in Texas. A flurry of reports showed the Democrat as the winner after CBS ran a headline that called the election in his favour, before later amending their report to state the race was still in question.\u0026nbspThe network amended their mistake live on air too.\u0026nbspThe close race has proven historic for Texas, a reliably red state that hasn\u0027t elected a Democrat to statewide office for three decades.\u0026nbspPlease take a moment for the live blog above to load.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Egypt: 800 tombs discovered back to Pyramid of GizaThey now think the postholes were a key feature of the equipment which allowed hundreds of workers to haul giant blocks of stone more quickly than previously understood.It has long been theorised that the Egyptians used a system of ramps to help construct the Pyramids but the new finding suggests the ramps were steeper.This helps to lend weight to the theory the Egyptians used a complicated system of pulleys allowing builders to push and pull the blocks of stone with greater speed and ease.Roland Enmarch, a senior lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Liverpool and a co-director of the project that discovered the postholes, said the system has revolutionised theories about ancient Egyptian builders.Archaeologists think they might have solved the mystery of how the pyramids were built (Image: )He told the : \u0026ldquoThe system we have discovered would allow more people to exert force at one time, so it means you would be able to exert more force and move the blocks more quickly.The discovery was made in September meaning Dr Enmarch and his fellow director of the Institut Francais d\u0026rsquoarcheologic Orientale (IFAO), Dr Yannis Gourdon have yet to publish the findings in any peer-reviewed journal but added they intend to.Dr Enmarch said the alabaster quarry where the discovery was made has been known to Egyptologists since it was found by Howard Carter, the archaeologist who found the tomb of Tutankhamun.According to Dr Enmarch, his team had been in the quarry to document and study inscriptions but became fascinated by how it was constructed and if there was anything they could learn about how it compared to the construction of the pyramids.                Ancient secrets of Egyptian black sarcophagus finally REVEALED                Egypt village discovered older than Great Pyramid of GizaThe newly discovered system has revolutionised theories about ancient Egyptian builders (Image: )The inscriptions in the quarry allowed the team to date the ramp and postholes to around the time of the Pharaoh Khufu who built the Great Pyramid of Giza, the last remaining of the seven wonders of the ancient world.Dr Enmarch added that there was no evidence in the quarry to confirm the theory, it would be reasonable that if such technology existed at the time it would have been used on the Great Pyramid itself.Meanwhile, Egypt\u0026rsquos tourism minister has said the country has seen a sharp increase in the number of visitors coming to marvel at the Pyramids.Overseas visitor numbers had plummeted in recent years due to the turmoil in the country following the Arab Spring in 2011 but annual tourist numbers are on course to top 10 million for the first time since 2012.Construction of a new mega museum is underway near the Great Pyramid of Giza (Image: )Rain Al-Mashat, Egypt\u0026rsquos tourism minister, told Reuters: \u0026ldquoIn 2017 we closed the year at around 7.5 million (visitors).

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite applying early thinking he would be all prepared, now hes around £ in debt.He told the Sun Online: “My paycheque in August messed me up completely. When September came along and I had to pay my rent for October, I didn’t have anything there.“I had no money in the bank, I had been paying to get my baby clothes and things, and I was left with nothing.”Universal Credit looks at the earnings in one calendar month to work out how much Brits can get paid. But any income they get in that time can mean benefits may be slashed.Because Simon got paid from his old job during his assessment period, he was then told he had to wait until the next month for any help. Overall this meant he went more than eight weeks for his first benefits payment.He’s just one of hundreds of people who have said they are being pushed into debt on the new benefits system, which rolls six payments into one monthly sum.Last week the Chancellor revealed that Brits will be able to get more help moving onto Universal Credit - but those changes won’t come in until .He also announced Brits will be able to earn up to £ more as a result of changes in the work allowance, but those won’t start to kick in until April either.Simon said: “It was all because of that first payment,I had applied later it wouldn’t have happened.“The balance on my journal said zero.“I’m overdrawn and getting bank charges because the money just isn’t there. It’s not a great start to taking care of my son.”Simon, who previously worked as an agricultural engineer making equipment for brewers, had to take out a £ emergency advance to help him out, and is maxing out his credit card too.“My rent is , that didn’t even cover it,” he added.“I’ve cut lots of my bills, but my council tax is still £, I have to pay for food for both of us, and I can’t get out of my TV contract until next year.“I’ve worked all my le and only had to claim Jobseekers once for a few months - that was a lot easier. If the system ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” he said.He thought he would be getting around £ a month in total in Universal Credit - which would include help with his housing, child tax credits, child benefit and income support.In his first month he got £, and his second month he got £ after the debts he owed were taken off.He’s now £ in debt and struggling to buy food and pay off bills.“Just because I had my final pay cheque in August, it’s messed me up for September onwards.“I’m overdrawn on my bank account, and getting overdraft charges because the money isn’t here.”Baylfs and debt letters have been coming in too - all since he first was forced to apply for Universal Credit.To make matters worse, he’s got a court summons because he’s behind with his council tax.But luckily kind friends and family have been helping Simon out buying clothes and nappies for his little one.“Finley will be  months soon, he’s teething and I’m doing it all on my own, it’s a struggle.“Winter’s coming too and with a baby you have to have the heating on.“I can’t move somewhere cheaper because my family network and support are all here. Universal Credit is just so stressful.”A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal Credit payments reflect a household’s circumstances as closely as possible during each monthly assessment period.“A person’s income during their first assessment period, including final wages, will therefore be reflected in their initial payment. If earnings or circumstances change during subsequent assessment periods this is taken into account and payments will adjust.This ensures thata claimant’s income falls, they will see a rise in their UC payment.The new system will roll six benefits into one monthly payment - but has been beset with problems so far.MPs have even threatened to block the Universal Credit switch altogether unless protections are made for the vulnerable.Today The Sun revealed that a loophole in the Universal Credit system has let fraudsters claim £, in fake advance payments.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What I hadn’t bargained on was that Joey wouldn’t be the dimmest person on set.That honour went to host Vick Hope, off Strictly, who distinguished herself early on by asking magician Ben: “What is a lock pick ”“It’s a pick that picks locks,” dumbo.She also tried introducing Diags, off Towie, as the show’s resident doctor, Ed Hope, and had a way of killing the mystery and tension that was quite hypnotic: “They’ll have to pick locks like their lives depend on it . . . ’cos they do . . . well, they kind of do.”If there’s one thing I’ll take from this show, though, it’s Vick’s final health and safety disclaimer.“It goes without saying,” she said, “don’t lock your head in a box of water, don’t handcuff yourself and don’t throw yourself in a lake.”Although, rule out none of the aboveLive And Deadly: Drowned comes back this time next year.Martin Keown: “Gambling is a gamble.”Dion Dublin: “Neil Lennon’s no shrieking violet.”And Alan McInally: “An hour gone and Manchester United haven’t been anywhere near the pitch.”.In these tearful, snowflake-ridden times, the most important and le-affirming television of the week was Wednesday’s The One Show.Other guests were present but, like every single viewer, they will have been transfixed by the remarkable Doddie Weir, the former Scotland rugby lock, in the shortbread tin suit, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease two years ago.Very calmly he explained exactly how this was in the process of killing him, before, with the classic understatement of a man from the Scottish Borders – an area not big on over-sharing – Doddie said: “It’s not the best disease to happen.”There were none of the tears we’ve all come to expect in these situations, though, or any sense of self pity, because big Doddie is too busy pushing back, organising his charity events and doing the most important thing of all in these or any other circumstances.Grabbing le by the throat and getting on with the simple joy of living. mynamedoddie.Sophie: “Popeye.”Bradley Walsh: “Witches are most often depicted flying on what object ”Keisha: “UFOs.”Tipping Point: “Found on boxes of cognac, the letters XO stand for Extra what ”Tracey: “Alcohol.”And Bradley Walsh: “What rock ’n’ roll star drove a truck for Crown Electric before he was famous ”Catherine: “Rock Hudson.”AND INTERRUPTION OF THE WEEK...Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Fixodent is an adhesive used to keep in place...”BZZZZZZ.

According to new polling by YouGov, only three per cent of us think we aren’t handing the taxman enough — and just  per cent that most people pay too little.It’s hardly surprising. For most, the biggest thing they want politicians to tackle in their own lives is the cost of living. The more the taxman takes, the harder it gets to cope.Yet when you talk to ordinary people about tax, you find out that it is not a financial issue. It’s a moral one.They’re not greedy. Or selfish. They know the NHS needs money. And the police.But they also know thatthe state takes too much of what you earn, you’re not going to bother earning it in the first place.So they think that you should always workyou can — but that it should always pay to work. Andthe Government is taking more than half, you’re working for them, not for you.That’s why our think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, is urging ministers to embrace two vital principles, outlined in our latest report.First, you shouldn’t have to pay tax before you’ve earned the bare minimum. One of the best things the Conservatives have done — inspired by our think tank — was to raise the amount you can earn before you pay income tax. At the most recent Budget, Philip Hammond hiked it to £, a year — from just £, back in .But there’s a sting in the tail. People aren’t paying income tax — but they’re still paying National Insurance, which is income tax by another name. We estimate that .million people have been “taken out of tax” — but are actually still paying it.And there’s another problem — at least for the politicians. Raising the personal allowance has kept take-home pay above water since the financial crisis.But just nine per cent of those we and YouGov surveyed knew it had gone up by that much, and  per cent said they hadn’t noticed it in their pay packet.That may be why just  per cent told us the Tories were the party of low taxes.That’s why we suggest a new universal basic income, a new right, for every worker, that the first £, a month will be free of both income tax and National Insurance. That’s a £ tax cut, which takes those .million people out of tax completely. And it should be front-and-centre on every pay packet.The next idea is just as important. It is that the taxman should let you keep at least p of every extra £ you earn — a work guarantee.At the moment, our tax system is riddled with points where you suddenly face a great big spike in what you pay.For the rich, it happens when your salary hits £,, and your tax rate soars to  per cent as that personal allowance is clawed back.But the biggest victims are those trying to come off welfare into work. In some cases, they only get to keep p in every extra £. So it’s no wonder they’re tempted to give up.This happens because even as the tax system gives, the benefits system tries to claw it back. That’s why we’re asking the Government to cut the rate at which Universal Credit is withdrawn to p in the £, to ensure it always pays you to climb the income ladder.Of course, this kind of thing costs money. We don’t want to copy Labour and go back to borrowing billions that we can’t afford. Or to scrimp on the NHS.But given the Government is spending more than £BILLION a year, there’s certainly room for some savings.For example, we currently spend £billion a year trying to encourage people to chip into a pension — yet have the lowest savings rate since records began. And that cash is spent woefully inefficiently — because the relief is based on your original tax bill, the top one per cent get as much help as the bottom  per cent, even though they need much less incentive to save.Replacing the current pension with an ISA-style system, where you got an up-front bonus for saving, would be simpler and more effective — and save us billions that we could use to help people right now.Andthe Government doesn’t like that idea, we’ve got plenty more.A forthcoming report of ours identies a dozen ideas for saving public money, adding up to £billion a year — from pegging Whitehall’s admin costs to the private sector, to eliminating wasteful and economically distorting subsidies, to reducing duplication in local government.Eventhe Government thinks it can’t find the money now, it needs to put making work pay at the heart of its future decisions. Not least because it is wildly popular.The universal working income is backed by  per cent to nine per cent. The work guarantee by  per cent to  per cent. These aren’t Tory ideas, they’re backed overwhelmingly by voters across the board.Perhaps that’s because these ideas embody what we all know to be true. Everyone who can work, should work.

In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York last month, Macron attacked Trump’s policies on Iran, Arab-Israeli peace, climate change and migration. In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump’s America First-style of nationalism, Macron also said: “Nationalism always leads to defeat.“If courage is lacking in the defence of fundamental principles, international order becomes fragile and this can lead as we have already seen twice, to global war. We saw that with our very own eyes.”In his radio interview today a bombastic Macron said: “We need a Europe which defends itself better alone, without just depending on the United States, in a more sovereign manner.”The EU launched a multi-billion-euro defence fund last year designed to develop Europe’s military capacities and make the continent more strategically independent.France has also led the creation of a nine-country force designed to be capable of rapidly mounting a joint military operation.Macron said: “Peace in Europe is precarious.“We have been hit by intrusion attempts in cyber-space and multiple interventions in our democracies.”Marcon also warned of authoritarian powers which are reemerging and rearming within the confines of Europe”.He has noted similarities between the world today and the financial crisis and “the nationalism which played on peoples fears” in the s.The president said: “The peace and prosperity which Europe has enjoyed for  years are a golden moment in our history..”Following the Europe  interview, aides to Mr Macron made it clear that he was not suggesting the USA was a military threat to Europe.Instead, he was highlighting how Mr Trump’s country could no longer be relied upon to defend the continent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000379813847.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit rollout too late to scrap","story":"Comptroller and Auditor General Sir Amyas Morse told MPs today that he thought the time had passed to go back to seven or eight dferent forms of benefit.The rollout of the flagship new benefits system rolls six into one monthly payment - but has been plagued with problems so far.Just under one million are on it now, but seven million are set to be on the new system by the end of .

We do not believe that this is acceptable, he said.The committee argued said the current timetable for rollout was unrealistic and needs to be urgently reconsidered - and the system for switching people over would be extremely complicated.On top of these announcements was a £.billion a year packages to push the work allowances up - meaning Brits will be able to get an extra £ a year from next April.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Control of the House gives Democrats the opportunity to block the Presidents agenda and puts his administration under the microscope. Nearly very aspect of Trumps presidency will face examination – from his long-elusive tax s to possible business ties with Russia and conflicts of interest. At last count, Democrats had gained a net  of the  Republican-held seats needed to capture a majority.  Here is why Democrat control of the House could spell trouble for Trump: The investigative committees will ramp up The majority party in the House or Senate receives more money and staff for investigations than the minority party. Control of key House , such as the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the Judiciary Committee, the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, is expected to sht to top Democrats. There is no plan for a special temporary committee to centralise the Trump investigations. The committees would spend January organising and hiring staff, with investigations cranking up as soon as February.  The scope and sequencing of investigations will be set Democratic House leaders and prospective committee chairs already have been discussing the scope and sequencing of investigations they will launchthey win control. They will move swtly to energise an oversight process they believe has stalled.  Representative Adam Schf, currently the top Democrat on the House intelligence , wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed that Democrats must restore Congress as an equal branch and check the ambition of an imperial and erratic president. Impeachment is not on the agenda - for now Democratic leaders have made clear they will not pursue Trumps impeachment – at least until the outcome of Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation of Russian meddling in the  U.S. elections and possible Trump campaign collusion with Moscow.  Obtaining Trumps tax s is a top priority Trump has refused to release his tax s, bucking the custom of recent U.S. presidents. The Ways and Means Committee would use its authority to request Trumps tax s from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  The judiciary and intelligence committees could then use the s to dig into whether Trump got anything of value from foreigners or had business ties to Russia. The Oversight Committee will take a two-lane approach The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has the broadest oversight jurisdiction and can examine any federal agency, person or company. Representative Elijah Cummings, currently the s top Democrat, is expected to chair the committee.

The Care Quality Commission sounded the alarm after saying Allied Healthcare could cease to operate at the end of this month. It said there was a “credible risk” that services could be “disrupted”the company collapsed. Allied Heathcare provides home care - help with washing, feeding and dressing - for , people in  councils across England. The company, which has been struggling with debts, employs , people. Councils have a duty by law to continue to provide carea private firm goes bust.  Andrea Sutclfe, chief inspector of Adult Social Care at the Care Quality Commission, said Allied Healthcare had only been able to confirm funding until  November . “We have not received adequate assurance that the company has, or will have, the ongoing funding or new investment necessary to ensure the business can operate beyond this date. “We have encouraged Allied Healthcare to provide us with a realistic financially backed plan to support the future sustainability of the business, and given them every opportunity to do so, but they have failed to provide adequate assurance regarding future funding. “It is now CQC’s legal duty to noty those local authorities where Allied Healthcare is contracted to deliver home care services, that we consider there to be a credible risk of service disruption.”  It is the first time such a warning has been issued to a major care provider. Glen Garrod, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said it had contingency plans in place. “This notication relates to likely, not definite, business failure. Care staff are essential to service continuity and we would urge them to wait for further information, and to carry on with their vital work. “Our focus right now is on reassuring the people receiving the service, the staff who work in them and the public that everyone who receives social care will continue to receive the care and support they need,” he said.  Barbara Keeley MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Social Care, said: “Allied Healthcare’s financial dficulties show the desperate state of the social care sector which is in danger of collapse because of this Government’s cuts. “Relentless cuts to the budgets of councils who deliver care mean that pound billion has been lost from adult social care since , meaning councils have less to pay providers of home care. “The Government must urgently come forward with plans to ensure that the nearly , people who currently receive state-funded care through Allied are not left without vital social care services.” A spokesman for Allied Healthcare said the company was “surprised and deeply disappointed” by the CQC’s announcement. He said there was “no risk” to services as financing had been secured. “The CQC has disregarded these assurances in spite of the robust evidence we have provided,” he added.

So to help answer this age-old culinary question, weve spoken to two expert chefs who know their way around the dish better than most. Weve called on top chefs from Toby Carvery and - with this Sunday being Remembrance Sunday - The Royal Navy, who between them serve up thousands of roast dinners for hungry civvies and troops every week. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  So we arranged for Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith to visit The Royal Navys galley on board HMS Northumberland to help rally the troops with a bumper feast alongside the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell - and give the rest of us a lesson in cooking the perfect roasties in the exclusive behind-the-scenes video above. Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James said he was proud of his restaurants long-standing commitment to the armed forces and championed the importance of people getting together to enjoy a meal - be it at home, away serving for their country or at their local Toby Carvery. He said: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate! And he went on to reveal the secret Toby twist to cooking the perfect roast potatoes.  Its all about the ruffling, he explains, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds. You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato.  The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell also lets viewers in on how to make fantastic gravy. He says: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in! Chef James finally lts the lid on how knock up fantastic Yorkshire puddings in the clip, adding: The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil.  Then add your batter to the oil and get them in the oven as quickly as you can!Find your nearest Toby Carvery at www.tobycarvery"},{"url":null,"title":"huge 15 tier cakes celebrates","story":"NewsHuge -tier cake celebrates  years of popular baking trendsThe giant confectionery delight - which puts Bake Offs showstoppers to shame - was created by Tate and Lyle Sugars to celebrate the th anniversary of their Thames refineryShareCommentsByAmanda Killelea:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe impressive cake in all its glory \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is the cake to end all cakes - a -tier confectionery delight, each made from the most popular trends in baking.

The accounts highlight the complex web of businesses US giant Kellogg’s, operates. Its four UK businesses made pound.million profit last year. But nine other firms based here, with investments worldwide, made losses of poundmillion last year. Firms can offset losses in one area against profits where, wiping out corporation tax liabilities.  Alex Cobham, of the Tax Justice Network, said companies such as Kellogg’s should be forced to publish clear country-by-country accounts. He said: “We know this transparency has an immediate impact in disciplining the worst excesses of tax avoiding behaviour...” Kellogg’s, whose UK boss is Steven Cahillane, said: “We pay all corporate tax according to the laws of the countries in which we make and sell our foods.” "},{"url":null,"title":"online shopper stunned after opening","story":"NewsOnline shopper stunned after opening huge cardboard box delivered to her homeDr Martens customer Katie Sunlay thought she had received someone s package by mistakeShareCommentsByTom KershawChris kitching:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe package that was delivered to Katie Sunlays home \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn online shopper was stunned when she ordered replacement shoelaces and the tiny item arrived at her home in a huge cardboard box. Katie Sunlay thought she had received someone s Dr Martens package by mistake given the size of the cm-long box which was filled with packaging. When the mum-of-one, from Howden, East Yorkshire, opened it she had to fish around before finding a white envelope containing her bright-red shoelaces. The -year-old told Hull Live that she was furious that such a large box was used to deliver such a small item, as the case highlights the problem of excess packaging from online orders.  Katie found that the laces could have fit into their packaging more than  times after they arrived on Monday. She is now urging companies to take more care in using the appropriate packaging over the Christmas period, feeling that they dont take the packaging of their products seriously enough. Katie said: This was disgraceful - I couldnt believe it and this is the last time I ever buy anything from Dr Martens.  I knew what was in it [the parcel] as soon as it arrived and couldn’t believe the size of it when I got home. I thought they’d sent me someone ’s parcel by accident. Someone mentioned the shipping charge would have been expensive and it could have been sent in an envelope. The funniest thing is the laces were placed in an envelope inside the box which doesnt make sense.  A number of retailers have been criticised for excessive packaging and councils have complained about the amount of discarded cardboard that can pile up at peak periods such as Christmas. Katie said: I want companies to understand this is not OK - with Christmas around the corner, people shouldnt be sent all this packaging which just goes to waste. Dr. Martens has been contacted for comment. In September, large firms were threatened with a so-called cardboard box tax to offset the cost of collecting and recycling discarded packaging. Councils are said to be spending tens of millions of pounds every year to dispose of cardboard from online deliveries.

A caring government would abandon Universal Credit, put up its hand and try to mend the broken benefits system. But these Conservatives don’t care about the victims they create. It feels like ministers enjoy revelling in the hardship inflicted, wrongly blaming the unfortunate for their plight. Universal credit requires a fundamental overhaul, yet all the Conservatives do is tinker and look the other way as children become collateral damage when families are hit with merciless, arbitrary penalties. Something is seriously wrong when the groups hurt most include single parents, the disabled and people with health problems. We applaud foodbank volunteers and supporters, but the truth is we wouldn’t need themwe had a welfare state worth the name.  School bully By threatening school heads who dare to criticise Tory austerity, gruesome Scrooge Philip Hammond shows he is a Tory villain with a heavy hand and tin ear.

Current-House Minority leader Pelosi said: Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It is about restoring the Constitution’s checks and balances to the Trump administration. Its about stopping the GOP and Mitch McConnells assault on Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the heathcare of million Americans living with pre-existing medical conditions. With a House majority, Democrats will have the power to investigate Trumps tax s, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his  campaigns links to Russia.

Ellen Santana, , scooped the top prize at the sexiest backside competition at the grand finale of the world famous competition in Satildeo Paulo. But before the surprise winner was able to give her victory speech, bitter rival Aline Uva ran on stage and ripped the winner’s ribbon from her body. Amid boos and catcalls from the crowd and other contestants she then launched into a tirade against the winner accusing her of having a “plastic” bottom. Aline, representing Rio Grande do Sul state, came into the Miss Bumbum final as favourite to clinch the title after polling the most online votes.But a  of judges in the live final placed her twelth.  Aline, , who refused to give back the winner’s ribbon, later told journalists: “I’m the only woman who deserves to be the winner.I played by the rules, and my bumbum is  per cent natural, unlike the winner who has a plastic bottom. “Miss Bumbum is a complete farce, and I’ve proved it. If it was a serious competition I would have won.” Winner Ellen later denied she had enhanced her cm-wide bottom with surgery, saying: “She took my ribbon but she can never take away my title. “I deserve this title because my butt is the firmest. But it’s not just about the bottom, it’s about character too, which I have and she doesn’t. “Now I want to be an inspiration to women around the world, to show them that they can achieve everything they dream of, whatever adversaries they face.” Second place in the world-famous bottom competition went to -year-old Flaacutevia Tamaio, an estate agent representing Brazil’s Distrito Federal.  And the first transexual ever to compete, Paula Oliveira, , came third - despite other contestants claiming she should never have been allowed to enter the competition, after she underwent sex change surgery six years ago. During last night’s long-awaited live final, hundreds of reporters and photographers packed the Eazy Club in Satildeo Paulo as the finalists were given two chances to impress a  of ten judges. The women first paraded wearing gowns before stripping off to their bikinis, with many leaving little to the imagination as they wiggled and thrusted their behinds in an attempt to win votes. Each judge gave a score between  and  for each of the women’s two appearances before votes were counted. But confusion broke out after the Ellen Santana, representing the state of Rondocircnia, was named the last contest’s surprise victor. As organisers tried to persuade bitter rival Aline to hand back the winner’s ribbon, the other women shouted: “Accept it, you lost. Ellen’s the champion. You’re a bad loser.”  Founder Cacau Oliver later said: “This is a competition where feelings run high, these fights are part of it. But it will be bad for her and for usshe doesn’t give back her winner’s ribbon.” Miss Bumbum has gained worldwide notoriety since the competition began in , with winners catapulted to overnight fame in Brazil. Each year thousands of women are whittled down to , each representing a Brazilian state, before a public vote sends  through to the live final. But founder Cacau Oliver announced that last night’s event would be the last of its kind, as the franchise concentrates on launching Miss Bumbum competitions in other countries such as Russia and Japan. The first Miss Bumbum World is also due to take place in Moscow next May, where the planet’s sexiest bottom will be crowned. Explaining why Miss Bumbum has come to an end in Brazil, Cacau said: “Miss Bumbum has become Brazil’s biggest beauty competition, and one of the most famous in the world. “Only the Rio carnival gets more media coverage, and our winners have gone on to become household names, ambassadors of the Brazilian bottom around the world. “But all good things come to an end.

The image was taken by the employees in protest of their treatment at Malaga Airport on the Costa del Sol on October . It shows six members of staff curled up and lying on the carpet next to printers, some using their blazers as pillows after they claimed to have been left without hotel rooms. They were part of a group of eight pilots and  cabin crew based in Portugal who say they were forced to spend several hours in the room after landing at Malaga just after midnight following ersions caused by Hurricane Leslie. Today Ryanair and Luciana Passo, head of the SNPVAC cabin crew union in Portugal, confirmed the sackings.  Ms Passo said: “Ryanair thinks it was harmed by the publication of that photograph when it was no more than a show of the crew members’ justied feeling of indignation.” Promising a swt union response to the airline’s “awful” decision, she added: “The union’s legal team are now dealing with the matter.” The budget airline complained the photo had been staged after union representatives claimed last month  crew members spent more than seven hours in the office sharing seven chairs and the floor before they were taken to a VIP area to sleep on shared sofas. It released CCTV video footage showing how the crew laid down on the floor to pose for the picture that went viral on social media. The company admitted the crew had spent “a short time” in the room because a Bank Holiday in Spain meant nearby hotels were full, but refuted claims anyone had slept on the floor.  Fernando Rikote,a Malaga-based delegate for SITCPLA, the Spanish union for airline employees, said the crews only flew back to Porto at .am the following day “without proper rest, without sleeping at all.” He claimed that when the crew asked the operating captain of the plane that flew them back to Portugalthey could open the aircraft bar and heat up some sandwiches and have some soft drinks, he called the operation room in Dublin for permission and was told: ‘No they can’t.” Another union rubbished the idea Ryanair couldn’t find room for the crew in one of the , hotel beds Malaga has. Aviation expert Alex Macheras, responding to the picture when it first appeared on a Facebook page called Ryanair MUST change, linked it to the strikes that have affected the airline and tweeted: “Once again, it become quite clear why Ryanair cabin crew are frequently striking, citing poor working conditions.”  Leading Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha said it had been told by the company six workers had been fired for “a serious breach of contract” for staging a photograph to support a  claim.” A Ryanair spokesman said: “All  cabin crew members in Porto were dismissed on Mon  Nov for breach of contract on grounds of gross misconduct, after staging a fake photograph to support a  claimthat they were ‘forced to sleep on the floor’ of the Malaga crew room, which was behaviour which damaged their employer’s reputation and caused an irreparable breach of trust with these  persons.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/INDUSTRY-Dundee-112464.jpg.jpg ","title":"350m tay cities deal delayed%e2%80%8b after devastating dundee michelin announcement","story":"The Tay Cities Deal is being delayed in the wake of the forthcoming job losses at Michelin.Ministers were looking at signing off the huge investment package today in Perth after both governments pledged a combined £ million of public money.The UK and Scottish administrations hope agreement on the terms, which will reveal which economy-boosting projects are being supported, can be sealed within a fortnight.A UK Government source said they would look at whether the package can be changed to mitigate the impact of the proposed Michelin closure.They stated: “We’ve agreed with the Scottish Government it would not be appropriate to launch the Tay Cities Deal today as planned.“We want to take a step back to absorb this deeply concerning news.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5be198fea7dfe.jpg ","title":"can we diversify factory dundee council chief to look at all options to save michelin site and jobs","story":"Dundee East MSP Shona Robison and city council leader John Alexander have vowed to do all they can to secure the future of the Michelin plant.Ms Robison said she has not given up hope following the company’s decision to close the factory in the next couple of years.She said Michelin had appeared to have a “bright future” in the city after the company invested £ million in the plant in recent years.She added: “The first stage is to ask: is there a viable plan that could save this factory  That’s the question that needs to be asked and needs to be looked at in detail.“If the answer to that is yes, then it’s about looking at what that would take and where it would come from.

I know I didn’t forget about it, it’s hard to take but I do much prefer having a game this close rather than have to sit on that Celtic defeat for a week.“Celtic are a top side and they showed it – we showed we are a side in between at the minute.“We had a gameplan and we felt relatively comfortable to begin with but, having been on the other side with Celtic, you know when you get that first goal it drags the opposition out and away from your shape a bit.“We were a bit naive and, out of probably eagerness to try to get back into it, we’ve gone into half positions where some are pressing and some are sitting off which becomes disjointed and we got punished.“We have big games coming up and, thankfully, there’s not the chance to dwell on it which you don’t want to do.”With the Steelmen just five points ahead after a poor start to the Premiership season themselves and then th-placed St Mirren at Dens to come next weekend, the Irish international says it’s “imperative” they start adding to their solitary victory this season.“Motherwell is huge.

If you work all week on a gameplan, it’s about sticking to the gameplan and trusting it,” he added.“We’ll have a plan, we’ll be ready.“In fairness to the team, we’ve taken a lot of hits in the last three games but application hasn’t been lacking.“That isn’t much of a positive because it should be a bare minimum but we’re going to give everything as a squad because Motherwell are a team that are scrapping, too.“I’ve played against Motherwell a lot, I know them well and know their manager.“They are a very tough team who are well-organised and have quality.“They did very well last year, they’ve had a sticky start this time but that can happen after a good season.“It’s going to be very hard, physically demanding and you need to match that but also have the quality and calmness to play.“We will need every member of the squad, every tool we have to bring it out because we’ve had a horric start.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The pair have performed all over Scotland as well as being broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland’s Classics Unwrapped multiple times.The afternoon started with the couple’s typical Spanish repertoire, a warm ‘Les Filles de Cadix’ that brought Bizet’s ‘Carmen’ to mind. Following Seiber’s ‘Four French Folksongs’ the audience was treated to the accomplished Savolini playing two solo pieces – originally Schubert lieder # now arranged for guitar. Although he only had six strings on his guitar, Savolini was still able to capture the rippling of water under the melody. The first act was finished with a light contrast of Scots songs including ‘Dream Angus’ and was met with murmurs of agreement in the audience.The second act began with a piece by Marco Ramelli by the name of ‘Moon’. The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh. After three Spanish songs by Joaquin Rodrigo during which the audience was told stories of a youthful girl’s wish to be picked as a companion for the king and a miller#s we staying true to her husband although her offer may be tempting, the two performed three of Granados  Tondillas. This was followed by a sentimental and personal depiction of Spain in Granados ‘Dance Española’s No.’ played by Sasha Savolini.McNeill and her partner finished with two Spanish songs by Turina, the first being an earthy and dramatic prayer to the virgin of hope and the second a feisty scorned woman with underlaying tones of sadness. Yet the audience was surprised to an encore of a beautully soft rendition ‘St Columba’s Prayer’.This was an entertaining afternoon enjoyed by everyone in Ardrishaig Public Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"etive tests loch fyne anglers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowLoch Fyne Sea Angling Club held its annual #blind pairs# competition out of Airds Bay on Loch Etive recently in testing conditions.The strong wind and heavy rain made it a dficult day for the anglers, but they made the best of it fishing from the small self drive boats.Loch Etive produced the usual species of spurs, whiting and dogfish with a total of  fish caught and ed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"calls find money build new","story":"NewsCalls to find money to build a new community hub to replace John Pollock CentrePopular facility described as \"not fit for purpose\"ShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV NewsJohn Pollock Centre, South Ayrshire Council.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCalls have been made to find cash to build a new community hub for people in the north of Ayr. The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"council chiefs apologise after sports","story":"NewsCouncil chiefs apologise after sports facility was dug up without warningResidents in Murkirk were left frustrated and helpless as their only sports facility was taken away due to wear and tear.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV News \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil chiefs have apologised after AstroTurf was dug up without warning.

He said: “Muirkirk articial AstroTurf was ripped up supposedly in the name of health and safety. “This is wrong, the park was in excellent condition. “It was that good, the mothers would meet up during the day with their young children in the park, shut gate and let them play knowing they were safe and there was nothing on the playing surface. It is well looked after by all its users. “After that primary school children would play football, then secondary kids would play football. After that, the adults would play. Why were no signs put up of this supposed damage  “Why was no one told – like Muirkirk Community Council – or a notice of any sort put up about damage and it being ripped up ” Another resident added: “This has caused outrage amongst kids, teenagers and adults alike. “In fact, a large section of our village are extremely upset. “The pitch, despite being free to use at any time following the closure of the games hall, was always well cared for by those who used it. “Anybody walking past the pitch will tell you that there was no evidence that the pitch or surrounding grounds were abused in anyway. “The village feel frustrated and helpless as our council come along and just seem to do whatever they want.” Bob McCulloch, acting head of housing and communities at East Ayrshire Council, said he e appreciated the disappointment of the community regarding the removal of the AstroTurf in Muirkirk. “The work was undertaken due to safety issues and the wear and tear of the pitch,” he added. “The council acknowledges that the community should have been informed of what was taking place and the reasons for this. “We apologise that this did not happen. “Council officers will be meeting with the community council and others shortly to explore the replacement options and we are committed to working with the community to find the best solution to enable local needs to be met.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors.

the era of swing and the year of Benny Goodmanrsquos Tattletale.Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played this with great gusto and we were informed afterwards that for a man who was known for such up beat music he was rather a grumpy inidual.The pace slowed a little for Scott Joplinrsquos The Entertainer.ldquoFor rag is never to be played fast, according to the man himself.This music composed in  was later discovered by the director of the Sting who heard it being played by his son one day, a film that won an Oscar for its musical song score.Music by Claude Debussy followed-a sandwich of Le Petit Negre Syrinx Gollywogs cakewalk.Syrinx was very atmospheric-the lights went out and Annersquos flute could be heard imitating the Greek God Pan playing the reeds from Greek Mythology.The versatile Anne played Rosemary by Frank Bridge on piano next-quite beautully-this surely must have been a piece about the love of his le.Dick then brought out the bass clarinet and introduced his own compositions - Pontefiore and Tarantella.Pontefiore was composed for a stage production set in the South of Italy in which a Private Angelo finds a little peace amongst the conflict of war.Tarantella is a   time dance which victims dance when bitten by a tarantula!Then it was time for the interval and for Anne and Dick to enjoy a well earned brew.After the tea break the audience were introduced to the saxophone and it was explained that it was invented by Adolf Sax and fully intended to be a very loud marching band instrument.Peqena Czarda by Pedro Iturralde showcased the saxophone wonderfully with its hints of Spanish Tango. Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls. Acker Bilk originally composed it as a lullaby for his daughter before being tempted commercially to change its name.My personal highlight of the evening was Lady be Good by George Gershwin - Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played with verve and swing.Body and Soul by Green and made famous by Colman Hawkins was just that! Jumpinrsquo at the Woodside by Count Basie did indeed jump!The final treat of the evening was Henry Mancinirsquos Pink Panther.Dick wondered whether there was any need for him to work again after composing this particular piece.Next months concert is on Sunday, November  at . pm.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

authorities across the country had seen spending on maintaining their roads cut by  per cent since .Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said the latest report which revealed the state of the countyrsquos network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges. Working out whether cuts or charges are the best way forward, whilst protecting the vulnerable, will make this yearrsquos budget no easy task. This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further. I am hoping that the budget will provide an opportunity to improve the position."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-for-140-holiday-lodges-at-former-golf-course","story":"Whitekirk Hill, which already has planning permission to revamp the clubhouse at the former Whitekirk Golf and Country Club, hopes to build ldquocirca  holiday lodges and woodland pods on the site.Debate centring on the development, which will be determined by the councilrsquos planning committee, has been ongoing for months.Tony Thomas, representing Whitekirk Hill, said: ldquoWhitekirk Hill Ltd is delighted to reach this milestone after months of hard work completing the environmental impact assessment .

Work would be spread over six phases and it is anticipated it could be phased over the next  years.The golf club opened in  and planning permission was given nine years ago to expand the facility, with plans including a -bed hotel, new clubhouse, a second course,  lodges and  homes, but that never got off the ground.Eric Martin, who lives in the village and is part of Dunpender Community Council, said residents were still looking at the plans before forming an opinion.Save Whitekirk Campaign has set up an online petition in opposition to the plans.A spokesman said: ldquoThe plans to destroy this wonderful landscape, a haven for wildle, show no respect for the countryside or local communities and are driven solely by profit. With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

It is one of those things where the script says: Exterior, night, forest or Exterior, field - you know it is going to be [filmed in] Wales in February.\"But it was such a childhood, little boy fantasy to actually be in it.\"The new series of Doctor Who, the first with the titular role played by a woman, has utilised historical settings before, including Alabama during the era of segregation in , when the characters meet and interact with Rosa Parks, the woman who played a key role in the civil rights movement.A new episode, Demons of the Punjab, is set in India in .Mr Cumming, who lives in the US but retains a home in Scotland, said: \"What was great about it is that I played James I and VI, and I decided to do him, his voice, like those politicians who are from Scotland, like Malcolm Rkind or Michael Forsyth, who are from Scotland, but pretend to be from England and have a strange sort of hybrid accents.\"So I did that, I played King James in honour of my loathing of Malcolm Rkind and Michael Forsyth.\": Everything you need to know about the new DoctorCumming, who was introduced on stage by the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said he still mayto the country for good.He said: \"I come back a lot, I have a place here still. I have this fantasy that I want to end up on an island.\"And living in America with Trump it daily gets more and more palpable and plausible that I might do that.\"A couple of years ago I said I wanted to go and live on an island, and I was in Barra, making this documentary, and all these people were saying its true, its true, hes coming.\"As I get older I feel I want to get away from everybody more, but I come back all the time.\"He added: \"I miss the sense of humour.

It was meant to open its doors in spring , but this has been pushed back by around six months.Elsewhere, Edinburghrsquos state-of-the-art, poundm Royal Hospital for Sick Children has been held up by at least  months. NHS bosses have been unable to put a definitive date on its opening.Long-awaited works to Aberbeenrsquos notorious Haudagain roundabout have also been pushed back by a year.Transport chiefs say it will now be operational in , due to ldquoone of the two bidders withdrawing from the competition.The Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Programme ndash which aims to slice  minutes off train journeys between the cities ndash has suffered a two-year delay, while the latest update notes the cost of the project has ballooned from pound million to pound million.Meanwhile, the construction of two new CalMac ferries ndash the MV Glen Sannox and Hull  ndash has suffered repeated delays.The project previously attracted controversy over loans provided by the Government.MV Glen Sannox will now be delivered in summer , with Hull  following almost a year later.All of the latest planning updates are included in the Scottish Governments infrastructure investment plan, which provides details for projects with a capital value of poundm or more.Scottish Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Mike Rumbles called on SNP ministers to ldquoget a grip.He said: ldquoThe SNP governmentrsquos record of incompetence in overseeing major projects grows week by week.ldquoThey really do need to get a grip of the basics of project management.ldquoBehind each of these delays is a community awaiting a modern hospital, a safe school or a road to be opened.Mr Rumbles previously warned of ldquosubstantial problems with a bridge over the River Don, which has been blamed for an indefinite delay in the new Aberdeen bypass.He labelled the Scottish Governments handling of the project an \"utter disgrace\".However a spokesman for Mr Matheson hit back at the criticism, pointing out many high-profile scheme were delivered on time or ahead of schedule.He said: ldquoItrsquos good of the Tories to highlight just some examples of the extraordinary number of capital projects the SNP Government is investing in across Scotland.ldquoThey didnrsquot mention the projects which were completed well ahead of schedule under this government, such as the M extension, nor did they acknowledge their own failure to deliver on many of these projects during their decades in power ndash most notably with the AWPR, which was first mooted in the s but is only now becoming a reality under the SNP.Last month it emerged finishing works on the pound.bn Queensferry Crossing will continue for another year.The bridge opened to traffic in August , but there have seen been repeated delays to work aimed at clearing up \"snagging\" issues.Officials said there had been \"dficulties in mobilising resources\", but MSPs were reassured there would be no extra cost to the public and no impact on journey times."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-a-tory-mp-making-a-stand-for-the-poor-dont-bet-on-it","story":"Thank goodness for Tracey Crouch, then, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford who resigned as sports minister last week in protest at what she said was an ldquounjustiable delay to a policy aimed at tackling the scourge of problem gambling. Having long campaigned for the maximum bet that can be placed via bookie-shop slot machines to be reduced from pound to pound, Ms Crouch said she was taking a stand after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the change will be introduced in October next year and not April as she had been expecting.The effects of this, she said, will be profound, with pound. billion expected to be lost on these machines between May , when the reduction was agreed, and October , when it will now take effect. Worse still, she wrote in her resignation letter, ldquoa signicant amount of the total will be lost ldquoin our most deprived areas.It is no secret that gambling and hardship go hand in hand, with the Scottish Government as long ago as  issuing a report that found that ldquodisadvantaged social groups who experience poverty, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and low levels of education and household income are most likely to suffer the adverse consequences of increased gambling. The clustering of betting shops in areas of deprivation such as Glasgowrsquos Dumbarton Road has long been a cause for concern and that report, which was written by University of Glasgow professor Gerda Reith, whose research focuses on problematic forms of consumption, also found that ldquoavailability and convenience are strongly associated with problem gambling.Having been introduced after then Chancellor Gordon Brown abolished betting duties in , the so-called fixed-odds betting terminalsMs Crouch has resigned over were still in their infancy when Professor Reithrsquos report was issued. In the years since, though, they have come to represent all that is wrong with the gambling industry, not least because they enable customers to place pound bets every  seconds, leading some to lose thousands in a single sitting.In Scotland, which, according to Gambling Commission figures, not only has more gamblers as a proportion of the population than Britain as a whole but more problem gamblers too, FOBTs are seen as such an issue that the Scottish Government - which cannot set gambling legislation - was given special powers under the  Scotland Act to limit their prevalence. Yet while Holyrood has been able to cap the number of machines installed in new betting shops for the past two years it has not yet taken action to do so, preferring instead to wait for the UK Government to show its hand on maximum stakes first - a decision that is looking less sound in light of the Westminster delay.Given this proleration of issues it is no wonder that Ms Crouch has been so roundly praised for taking a stand on the delay to implementing reduced FOBT stakes, with commentators from across the political spectrum highlighting not just the passion and courage that led her to make the move but her principles and morals too. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, took to Twitter to praise her ldquocommitment to doing right.Yet as Ms Crouchrsquos parliamentary voting record makes clear, this is not a politician who usually cares so deeply about doing what is right for those living in deprivation, but rather someone who is usually happy to toe the Nasty Party line. Indeed, according to parliamentary monitoring website They Work For You, while Ms Crouch has consistently voted in favour of tax breaks for higher-rate taxpayers and against taxing bankersrsquo bonuses, she has also been consistent in her opposition to using public money to create jobs for young people in long-term unemployment and in her support of reducing welfare spending and restricting the scope of legal aid. She has even voted against giving local authorities the power to regulate the use of FOBTs and opposed a plan that would have required online bookies to automatically ban any problem gambler who had registered for self-exclusion.Put in that context the motivation behind Ms Crouchrsquos resignation is harder to fathom, particularly as her parliamentary colleagues have rubbished the claim that the rule change was due to come in in April anyway. One thing is clear, though: this is not a rogue Tory whose moral compass has led her to care more about social justice and deprivation prevention than her own party and career. Sure Ms Crouch is to be admired for taking a stand on problem gambling, butevery other political decision she makes is to the detriment of those whose plight she is supposedly trying to highlight, who, ultimately, stands to benefit "},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-vulcan-7-kings-edinburgh-three-stars","story":"Vulcan Kingrsquos Theatre, EdinburghNeil Cooper, Three starsAn actorrsquos le can go in many ways.

And at no point were any complaints referred to the First Minister under the Fairness at Work policy when she was Deputy First Minister.However in court, Ronnie Clancy QC, for Mr Salmond, said the government now acknowledged one of the two January complaints had been raised in December  and was resolved to ldquofinality.He told judge Lord Pentland he had averments from the respondents - Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans and the Scottish Ministers - that ldquoacknowledge that the issue was raised in some way and which acknowledge that finality was achieved at the time.But he said the government had yet to clear up whether the previous complaints procedure, known as the Fairness at Work procedure, has been applied.Lord Pentland said that was surely a matter of fact which ought to be settled by agreement between the parties.Christine OrsquoNeill, for the Scottish Government, said she would take instruction on the matter and take the courtrsquos observations on board.She said Mr Salmondrsquos side had obtained three affidavits about this complaint, referred to as Complaint D, one from himself and two from other iniduals.She said that evena complaint had been raised earlier, it would not mean a formal complaint could not be lodged subsequently, and argued the pre-formal complaint process was \"essentially irrelevant\" to the question of fairness.Mr Clancy said he understood the governmentrsquos position to be that all it had to do was tell Mr Salmond ldquothe gist of the complaints against him.Lord Pentland said lawyers for the government would argue those acting for Mr Salmond do not \"have a relevant case as a matter of law\", while the latter believe they were not given adequate information about the allegations.A substantive hearing is due to start on January  and last four days.Mr Salmond launched the legal action last August after Ms Evans told him she intended to make a public statement about her investigation into the January complaints.Mr Salmond took early legal action in an attempt to stop any publicity around the case, but details emerged in the media regardless.The governmentrsquos most senior law officer, the Lord Advocate, James Wolffe QC, also advised the matter be referred to thepolice, who are conducting their own inquiry.Following publicity around the complaints, Mr Salmond resigned from theSNPafter  years as a member,  of them as the partyrsquos leader.He strongly criticised Ms Evans, who has been defended by NicolaSturgeon.Backed by pound, of donations to a crowdfunder appeal he linked to independence, Mr Salmond is now seeking a review of the way the complaint process was conducted.Speaking to the media outside the ScottishParliamentlater, Mr Salmond said: ldquoIrsquom very content that we will get our opportunity to state our case.ldquoWersquove got four days of a hearing in January, and Irsquom very content thatrsquos where wersquoll do our talking, and thatrsquos respectful to the court.He added: ldquoWersquoll do our talking in the Court of Session.

There may be a glut in the global market for Michelinrsquos small car tyres, and diesel and petrol cars are being phased out. But we are not going to see the end of transportation, which is the basis of civilisation itself. Whatever you look at ndash electric, hydrogen, compressed air ndash the vehicles of the future are going to need tyres.And increasingly they are likely to require small, high-quality tyres, with low rolling resistance, of the kind Michelin was supposed to specialise in making in Dundee. The current vogue for ever-larger cars, with bigger wheels, which we are told has killed demand for the plantrsquos tyres, cannot last. Heavy diesel SUVs will be so expensive to run in five or ten yearsrsquo time that no one in their right minds will buy them. It is anyway one of the daftest fashions of modern times.But surely, making car tyres is a noxious chemical process that pollutes the environment and leaves a massive carbon footprint  Well, not in Dundee it doesnrsquot, where much of Michelinrsquos power comes from two wind turbines. Sixty-one million pounds ndash much of it public money ndash has been spent on making this plant one of the most advanced and least polluting on the planet. The more you look at the closure of Michelin Dundee, the less it seems to make sense. This is not some rust belt relic.The Michelin plant used to provide secure employment for nearly , workers, and many more in the companies that depended on their wages. It contributed at least pound million to the local economy ndash four times the best estimate of the VArsquos impact. These were secure, well-paid jobs, not disposable seasonal tourist work. You can well understand the anger of the workforce here, which has worked closely with the French firm since it came here in .Indeed, one of the reasons Michelinrsquos closure came as such as surprise is that it has been, in many ways, a model of modern, constructive industrial relations and rarely in the news ndash unlike plants like Timex, which closed after a bitter strike in . The Michelin union leaders are talking about ldquobetrayal by the company, not least because the news was leaked to the press before the workforce got to hear of it, and before Christmas too. Why, they ask, has this happened only three years after the Dundee plant was reconfigured precisely so that it could make a larger range of bigger tyres Well, the biggest and most obvious change is Brexit. That has been the black swan event that no one in large-scale manufacturing in the UK considered a possibility until . And only very recently has the prospect of a no-deal Brexit become a reality. This is a French firm, after all, and you might expect it to be worried about the prospect of .m tyres having special export certicates and tarfs when they cross new borders to the European single market.However, the company insists that its decision to close Dundee has nothing to do with Britainrsquos decision to leave the European Union. There is no particular reason to disbelieve it. Indeed, it might well have suited the pro-European French President, Emanuel Macron, to declare that Brexit is such a disaster on wheels that even tyre manufacturers are fleeing the UK.So, wersquore left with the firmrsquos main claim that cheap tyres from Asia are being dumped here, and making even modern car tyre manufacturing uneconomic. That has nothing directly to do with Brexit, but it does relate to it. It underlines the kind of economic environment into which Britain is headed, post-Brexit. Increasingly, workers in the UK will be competing with workers in developing countries where wages are often nugatory.The ldquoGlobal Britain project is all about thrusting Britain into this low-cost, low-regulation market, a kind of Hong Kong of Europe, where we produce cheap goods to flood the EU. At least thatrsquos the theory of the Tory Brexiters. A more likely scenario is cheap goods, like tyres, flooding into Britain destroying what is left of our manufacturing base. Britain may be a post-industrial economy, but that doesnrsquot mean that making things is unimportant. Brexit is isolating the UK from EU supply chains and hastening deindustrialisation.Should the Scottish Government intervene  Well, its powers are extremely limited, not least by EU regulations on supporting loss-making industries. A lot of public money, around poundm, has already gone into the plant. It doesnrsquot seem plausible that it could be nationalised, because it is an integral part of a global company, the second-largest tyre manufacturer on the planet, and would lack the global retail networks to sell the tyres evenit could make them cheaply enough.Some might suspect that Michelin had known all along that its plant was doomed and was just using what public money it could access to run the plant down while extracting what profits it could. But that would be ungenerous. Michelin has a reputation for being a relatively responsible company, and anyway it invested a great deal of its own cash in the Dundee plant. Unfortunately, it was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.But these are not jobs that Britain can lose with equanimity. The intellectual capital being built in Dundeersquos universities and the games sector GTA may provide twice as many jobs as Michelin, according to TIGA, which represents the digital publishing and video games industry. But these jobs can go as fast as they arrive. Scotland needs an industrial policy that doesnrsquot depend on the vagaries of the market. And the sudden collapse of the UK tyre industry is a signal reminder of what le would be like outside the European Union."},{"url":null,"title":"a-15m-funding-scheme-for-edinburghs-festivals","story":"The new scheme, involving the capitalrsquos council, Edinburgh Festivals and the Scottish Government, is called PLACE, or Platforms for Creative Excellence.The first section o f funding, worth pound.m will be for the first three years, and decisions for another pound.m will be made in  .This package will include poundm from the participating festivals themselves, to create the overall poundm sum.The money, the festivals said, will be used for ldquonew commissions, global and European premieres, multi-year national and international programming partnerships and onward tours of work.One will be a ldquoprogramme bringing Scottish and international writers together to explore hotspots in world politics and share inside stories of their journeys with audiences.The Edinburgh International Festival will receive pound.m, and the Fringe, pound, while the cityrsquos book festival will receive pound, in funds for a series of projects.One of the Edinburgh International Book Festival projects will be Citizen, a three-year residency programme, \"empowering communities across Edinburgh to engage in democratic discourse and build a relationship with the August Festival\".The EIF funding will be used to increase its community engagement, among other plans.Each partner has made an \"annual in-principle commitment of poundm\" for the duration of the programme, and the programme will run for a period of five years.City of Edinburgh Council Leader Adam McVey, said: ldquoBorne out of our productive City Region Deal discussions with the Scottish Government, this joint funding package is a commitment to protect the legacy and support the future of our festivals.\"Between them, the festivals attract audiences of over .m and are vital to our cityrsquos success and reputation, adding poundm to the Scottish economy every year.\"It is a huge milestone to announce this first phase of investment.\"The funding will support some really pioneering projects, ones which without our joint support could not take place.\""},{"url":null,"title":"anm group s charity calendar now on sale","story":"Scotland#s leading farming co-operative, ANM Group, has announced that its  charity calendar is now on sale.The calendar has been created following a four-month social media photo competition.The competition received more than  entries.The winning images were taken by members, customers and farming enthusiasts from the north east and showcase the best of Scotland’s agricultural industry.Sales of the calendar will be donated to Northsound Cash for Kids and the Royal Northern Countryside Initiative.Grant Rogerson, ANM Group Chief Executive, said: “Our sincere thanks and appreciation to all members and customers for participating in ANM’s social media photo competition.“All proceeds from the sale will go directly to two great local charities, selected by our charity committee.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmWork is underway to repair a fibre optic cable, following widespread disruption to Orkney Islands Council#s IT services.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Wednesday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

not named in court - for his case.The full case is due to be heard over four days from January  next year.Read more: SNP claim Brexit ‘chaos’ will result in Scottish independence majority©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824482.1541414183!/image/image.jpg","title":"call for action as new car sales stuck in reverse","story":"Motor industry leaders have called for government policies that #encourage rather than confuse# after a further fall in car sales.New figures show that overall UK registrations reversed . per cent last month to about , vehicles, compared with , in October .Registrations are down . per cent this year compared with the first ten months of last year, according to the latest data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders .Sales of diesels suffered another mauling last month, tumbling . per cent, year-on-year.The SMMT said there had been a shortage of some car brands caused by backlogs at testing centres, amid tougher emissions regulations introduced in the European Union.There has also been growing concern about the impact of diesel car emissions on air quality and uncertainty about what taxes and restrictions will be introduced on them.Demand for alternatively fuelled vehiclessuch as hybrids and pure electrics increased by . per cent to take a market share of . per cent. This was partly boosted by the news that grants for AFVs are set to be cut, drawing forward sales.SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: “Vehicle excise duty upheaval, regulatory changes and confusion over diesel have all made their mark on the market this year so it’s good to see plug-in registrations buck the trend.“Demand is still far from the levels needed to offset losses where, however, and is making government’s decision to remove purchase incentives even more baffling.“We’ve always said that world-class ambitions require world-class incentives and, even before the cuts to the grant, those ambitions were challenging. We need policies that encourage rather than confuse.”Alex Buttle, director at car buying comparison website Motorway, said: “These latest figures suggest new car sales are entrenched at a sub-par level for the long term. The industry is gearing up for a cold, hard winter that could stretch long into  and beyond. “A fatal combo of interest rate fears, Brexit concerns and confusion over fuel types sees the industry locked in the deep freeze and in a perpetual battle to pick itself up off the floor. “AFV sales, after spluttering a little in September, did at least get back on the right track in October, and a  per cent rise does suggest some cause for optimism. However, the government’s bizarre decision to cut funding towards the Plug-in Car Grant could well blunt that growth in months ahead.”The Ford Fiesta was the best-selling model last month, following by the Volkswagen Golf and Mercedes-Benz A-Class in second and third places, respectively.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825482.1541531915!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith edinburgh airport chould charge people to sit down","story":"Dropping off passengers at Edinburgh Airport could be freethe car just slows down without actually stopping with wardens on hand to charge drivers who failed to maintain sufficient speed, suggest Alexander McCall Smith.Edinburgh Airport is a very popular and important place. If you live in the east of Scotland, it is the obvious place to go in order to fly to all sorts of destinations. In fact,you want to fly, you have to go to an airport – an observation so obvious that it hardly needs to be made. But it is worth bearing in mind when considering the responsibilities that the people who run airports have. They have a captive market, and they have to act accordingly.Edinburgh Airport has been consistently criticised for its astonishingly expensive parking charges. Obviously the airport has to weigh considerations of encouraging the use of public transport, which is environmentally so much better, against the desire of people to use their cars. If parking were to be prohibitively expensive, then people would be forced to use buses and trams. Butyou do allow it, which they do, then it should only be charged at a rate that is considered fair and not exorbitant. Otherwise it looks like taking advantage. And we might remind ourselves here that the idend paid to the owners of Edinburgh Airport this year was considerably higher than the previous year. Edinburgh Airport, in other words, makes lots and lots of money.But with that, it has a responsibility to avoid antagonising its users too much. It can antagonise them a bit, but not too much. It should not make them wait for ages and ages in a taxi queue – which seems to happen frequently – and it should also listen to the concerns of Edinburgh’s splendid, long-suffering taxi drivers. They, as a body, seem to have their issues, and they, as a body, are always right. Taxi drivers rarely present a finely nuanced view of the world as they see it.: Letters: Greedy Edinburgh Airport drop-off price hike is outrageousBut we should not spend too much time criticising the equally splendid body of people who run Edinburgh Airport. This is a well-managed airport and they obviously run it very efficiently, evenpeople tend to moan a little bit . It is not easy to run an airport, particularly when the airport has also become a large shopping centre, or, more accurately, an eastern souk. It is quite a business combining the job of running a grand souk and a place where people are able to catch a flight and find enough seats to sit down while they wait for their flight.One solution, of course, would be to charge people to sit down at the airport. This is not currently done, but I feel that it will not be long before that commercial opportunity is recognised and acted upon. These charges should be moderate – say, one pound for ten minutes, rising to five pounds payable by those who clearly have come to the airport with the intention of sitting around for a long time. These people should be discouraged from sitting on private seats and redirected to public benches outside. I have also noticed that the airport currently does not charge for the use of its toilets. This is something that must have escaped their notice and should be acted upon. Making the charge realistically high – say two pounds per visit – would discourage people from using the facilities, or even reading in the loo.: Edinburgh Airport passenger numbers break . million barrierBut lest this sounds like a series of complaints, I would like to make some positive suggestions for the airport, in its undoubted wisdom, to consider. The first of these is for a fast track facility to allow passengers who do not wish to follow a deliberately winding and circuitous path through their fantoosh duty free shop. This would enable you to get from security to gate without being forced to endure the efforts of salespeople to get one to sample whisky, buy sunglasses, or try perfumes. People can tell when they are the victims of intense sales pressure, you know. And some people, mirabile dictu, like to walk straight, rather than wander through a shop.As far as drop-off charges are concerned, it is about time that the airport recognised public resentment over these and introduced a new, conciliatory system whereby those who drop people off from their car are not charged, as long as they don’t stop the car. This would mean that drivers could slow down while their passengers leaped out of the car, tossing their suitcases ahead of them. Wardens could be on hand to impose charges on those who did not maintain sufficient speed in that manoeuvre.And finally, in this constructive spirit, how about introducing an emotional baggage desk in the departure hall  Many of us travel with excessive emotional baggage, and it would be a great innovationwe could declare this at the airport before the flight. This would mean that you would drop off your physical baggage at check-in, and then move on to declare your emotional baggage to an understanding and sympathetic agent at another desk. Things like unresolved issues. Doubts. Unfulfilled desires. There’s so much to talk about at airports.Use of the emotional baggage counter could attract a small charge.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825485.1541531951!/image/image.jpg","title":"join the british army foreign nationals should read this first","story":"Foreign nationals being urged to join the UK armed forces might wish to askit is is worth it, writes Martyn McLaughlin.In many ways, the news that Britain’s armed forces are to signicantly step up their recruitment drive among Commonwealth nations feels like the quintessential Brexit story.It knits together the narratives of a country wrestling with its imperial past, while stumbling and blinking its way towards an uncertain future, one where new threats must be mitigated by old alliances. At its heart, lie perpetually confounding questions of Britishness and belonging.The Ministry of Defence announcement, signalling an end to the five-year residency requirement for Commonwealth citizens looking to join the armed services, almost read like a celebration. It hailed the military’s “long-held links” with the Commonwealth and noted how its people have “bravely served in a iety of roles”. This proud legacy, said Mark Lancaster, the armed forces minister, would be seized upon, bringing “key skills” and “dedicated service”. He added: “Their dferent perspectives will also help us to enhance our cultural understanding, giving us an operational advantage over our adversaries.”It is hard to decide which subtext is the most absurd, but let us begin with the notion that Britain’s armed services are bastions of ersity and inclusion. This is a force where women account for just one in every ten regular forces personnel, and until last month, were ineligible to apply for swaths of roles. It is a force where black, asian and minority ethnic representation sits at . per cent. No less laughable is the idea that new Commonwealth recruits will be a bonus to Britain’s military might. Be under no illusions, this measure is explicitly designed to plug a gap of , soldiers, sailors and air personnel – the largest such shortfall in eight years. In the form of the Commonwealth, the UK Government – which has shown no shame over how it betrayed the contribution of the Windrush generation, veterans among them – has found a way to insult a new cohort under the guise of offering a gilded opportunity. : UK armed forces to allow foreign nationals to joinIt is farcical that he service of these men and women is not deemed a sufficient sacrice to earn them automatic UK citizenship, but then, there has always been an awkward, conflicting duality to the identity of the ranks of Britain’s Commonwealth personnel. On the one hand, they enjoy the heroic status afforded to all those prepared to kill – and die – for the realm on the other, they remain ‘others’, a migrant force who serve with, but not in, our forces.The earliest ranks of Fijians and Jamaicans, unable to apply for UK citizenship even after serving for more than five years, learned the hard way. The reason given was a risible as it was cruel – time served in German and Cypriot outposts nulled continuous residency. It took until  before the Home Office changed the rules.Until , a child born to foreign nationals in the armed services during an overseas posting was not automatically eligible to become a UK citizen, an appalling oversight which meant the siblings in some families had dferent nationalities. It is easy to characterise these incidents as anomalies, but the history of our Commonwealth service personnel is one of institutionalised disadvantage. You hear it still in the idle, ignorant chatter of ‘foreign legions’ and ‘mercenaries’, but it is built into the system too.The cumulative impact of immigration issues, visas, travel and cultural dferences leaves many Commonwealth recruits feeling subordinate, asked to shoulder every risk infor few of the rewards.Studies into this Commonwealth military contingent are thin on the ground, but their findings are striking. A  London School of Economics report found they were often passed over for promotion or not drafted into roles they applied for due to racial prejudice and a lack of assimilation.: Almost , Scottish MoD jobs have goneIn March, meanwhile, Anglia Ruskin University researchers found that the most problematic issue facing the Commonwealth armed forces community was being able to remain in the UK because of costly visas and complex immigration rules. As one respondent put it, “all aspects of le unravel” when faced with the byzantine immigration system. The cost of settlement for an inidual service member from the Commonwealth is £,. Should they wish to bring a partner and two children, the sum spirals to an eyewatering £,. Indeed, figures from the Army Families Federation show visa costs increased by  per cent between  and , whilst the cost of family members remaining permanently in the UK rose by  per cent for adults and an astonishing , per cent for children over the same period.As things stand, a Commonwealth Army private on basic pay does not meet the minimum immigration income threshold of £, to bring a spouse and child to the UK.Quite how the UK Government can allow this to continue, while hoping to recruit an additional , people from the Commonwealth each year, speaks either to its ignorance or its disdain. Two of the central tenets of the armed forces covenant stipulate that no one should be disadvantaged by their service, and that in some cases, special treatment might be appropriate. If we are so intent on fostering closer links between our military and the Commonwealth, how can we continue to turn a blind eye to the problems faced by those who are prepared to make the ultimate sacrice ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825521.1541540887!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish government pledges support for michelin staff","story":"The Scottish Government will do all it can to secure the future of Michelin workers affected by the planned closure of the Dundee plant, finance secretary Derek Mackay has said.An action group has been established and will meet in the city on Monday following the company’s announcement the tyre factory will cease production within two years.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander described the proposed shutdown as a “body blow” for all  workers.A meeting was held yesterday at the plant, while production has been suspended until tomorrow to allow employees to digest the news.Mr Mackay, who met representatives from Michelin, the Unite union and Dundee City Council, said: “This is devastating news for the area and that’s why the Scottish Government is totally focused on trying to salvage what we can from the situation.“I’m establishing an action group that will bring together the best proposition we can possibly put to Michelin to try to ensure that the plant and the workforce have a future here.“The company does not want to revisit the decision but that’s not going to deter me from putting forward the best possible proposition I can for the workforce.“We can look at a range of interventions and I call on the UK government to step up to the plate as well.”Mr Mackay, who met senior Michelin executives in Paris on Sunday after learning of the planned closure, added: “I do believe there’s hope for the factory but onlywe all pull together.”Potential options include “repurposing” the factory to do other work for Michelin.The market for premium smaller tyres such as those produced at the Tayside factory has dropped signicantly due to an increase in cheap imports from Asia and a sht to larger car tyres, according to the French firm.The plant opened in  is due to cease operations by mid-.Unite said it had been working on a “flexibility agreement” involving voluntary redundancies and changes to the sht patterns over the last two months to secure the factory’s future. It said it was given no notice of Monday evening’s announcement.Many workers said they found out via the news and social media.Marc Jackson, Unite Michelin convener, said: “It is important to stress to the workforce and the wider community in Dundee that Unite has a viable plan on the table.“The flexibility agreement, which we believed would be signed-off this week, takes into consideration the current challenging market conditions but we have a plan in place to manage this situation over the coming years.“The workforce can be assured that Unite will work tirelessly to ensure that this flexibility agreement is reconsidered by the Michelin Group and that the factory can stay open.”Drew Morris, , who has worked at Michelin for  years, said: “I’ll be OK – it is the younger guys I’m devastated for. There are young guys in there with big mortgages and big financial commitments. They have said they will support people –you want to go and retrain as a gas fitter or something they will pay your fees. But the closure has come out of the blue.”He added: “These are good, well paid jobs in here – they’re not going to be replaced by the service jobs coming up down in the docks and the city. “It is a shame for the younger generation. They haven’t blamed Brexit for this but how can it not be to do with that. “Everything we make is imported then exported –there are going to be problems at the borders how can that not affect us ”Dundee East MSP Shona Robison said all options would be looked at.She said: “It’s not going to be easy but one thing that really comes through is just how strong the workforce is.“They have been flexible over the years, they have been to many a kind of clf edge with this plant and have come through the other side of it.“Everybody is determined to do everything possible to either maintain the plant or repurpose the plant to maintain as many jobs as possible.”Dundee is part of a £ million Tay Cities Deal aimed at boosting economic growth in the region through investment from both the Scottish and UK governments.Michelin said it would provide a personalised support package for each worker, with the opportunity to train in new skills and the possibility of being redeployed within the company or where.It will begin a consultation with employees and trade unions on the closure plan over the next fortnight.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825523.1541574200!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may says brexit deal won t come at any cost","story":"Theresa May has warned the UK will not accept a Brexit deal #at any cost# as pressure rises to break the deadlock before the end of November.At a three-hour cabinet meeting, ministers were told there would be no time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on a dealthe last remaining stumbling blocks aren’t resolved in the coming weeks.However, in a bid to raise the pressure on the EU and on Brexiteers in her own party, the Prime Minister said she would not accept an arrangement that keeps the UK under “backstop” measures to prevent a hard border in Ireland “indefinitely”.Hopes of a special Brexit summit to finalise the withdrawal agreement in November appear to be receding as the Irish border continues to stand in the way of a deal.A special summit later in the month would be dependent on EU negotiator Michel Barnier declaring that “decisive progress” has been made in talks.On Monday, the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar made clear he would not accept an arrangement which gave the UK unilateral powers to ditch a customs union, intended to keep trade flowing freely over Ireland’s land border, without the agreement of Brussels.Eurosceptic Tories including the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab are understood to have pushed for a unilateral break clause with a notice period of as little as three months, but ministers were warned by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox yesterday that would risk a no-deal Brexit. Mr Raab and Mr Cox will now draw up proposals for a “review mechanism”.Mr Michel Barnier said yesterday that Brussels was “willing to consider improvements to the backstop” but insisted that “this backstop must be a genuine backstop. “Backstop means backstop. And a backstop cannot have a time-limit”.Mrs May assured ministers there would be another Cabinet before any deal is done, but her official spokesman said no extra meeting has been scheduled ahead of the regular gathering next Tuesday.Any agreement will depend on an “acceptable” framework for future relations on trade and security, to be covered in a separate political declaration, Downing Street said. “Don’t be under any illusion, there remains a signicant amount of work to do,” the spokesman told reporters.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Dublin’s stance was making a no-deal Brexit likely.“Looks like we’re heading for no deal,” he tweeted. “Such an outcome will have serious consequences for economy of Irish Republic.

And they would claim subpoena power to investigate Mr Trump’s personal and professional shortcomings.Some Democrats have already vowed to force the release of his tax s. Others have pledged to pursue impeachment, although removal from office is unlikely so long as the Republicans control the Senate.The road to a House majority ran through two dozen suburban districts Hillary Clinton won in . Democrats flipped seats in suburban districts outside Washington, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Denver.The results were more mixed deeper into Trump country.In Kansas, Democrat Sharice Davids beat a Republican incumbent to become the first Native American and gay woman elected to the House.But in Kentucky, one of the top Democratic recruits, retired Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath lost her bid to oust Andy Barr.Mr Trump sought to take credit for retaining the Republicans’ Senate majority, even as the party’s foothold in the more competitive House battlefield appeared to be slipping.“Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!” he tweeted.History was working against the president in the Senate:  was the only midterm election in the past three decades when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats.Yet Mr Trump’s party will maintain Senate control for the next two years, at least.In Texas, Ted Cruz staved off a tough challenge from Democrat Beto O’Rourke, whose record-smashing fundraising and celebrity have set off buzz he could be a credible  White House contender.In Indiana, Trump-backed businessman Mike Braun defeated Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly. In Missouri, Josh Hawley knocked off Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill. And in Tennessee, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn defeated former Governor Phil Bredesen, a top Democratic recruit.In the lead-up to the election, Republicans privately expressed confidence in their narrow Senate majority but feared the House could slip away. The party’s grip on high-profile governorships in Georgia and Wisconsin were at risk as well.“Tomorrow will be a new day in America,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is in line to become the next House speaker should the Democrats take the majority. ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings.

Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option for making change in the north. - Declan Kearney MLAThe publication of an open letter to An Taoiseach, LeoVaradkar from over one thousand signatories in the Irish News is a powerfulintervention supporting the rights of Irish citizens in the north of Ireland. December that Irish citizens in the north “would never again be left behind by anIrish government”.These Irish citizens have explicitly urged Leo Varadkar toadhere to his expressed commitment from last year, “and to redouble yourefforts, and the efforts of your government to ensure that our rights areprotected”.Their intervention comes at a time of deepening politicalcrisis, and increased uncertainty and instability caused by the continueddenial of citizens’ rights, and the fast approaching Brexit catastrophe.This initiative indicates the frustration and anger amongrepublicans and nationalists and other progressive minded people about thedenial of rights here, and which are taken for granted where throughoutthese islands.It is outrageous that the northern state remains a rightsback water where language, marriage equality, womens reproductive health andlegacy justice rights, as well as a Bill of Rights are blocked.Northern nationalists are absolutely incensed with thecontinued denial of democracy and democratic rights.They are not prepared to put up with their Irish identitybeing treated with disrespect and contempt.Some of the signatories who have backed this highlysignicant intervention were active supporters of, and participants in theoriginal Civil Rights Movement  years ago.But many more are the children and grandchildren of those whocampaigned and marched in support of modest civil rights reforms and who werebeaten and shot off the streets and roads in the north because the unioniststate refused to deliver equality and rights.These citizens reflect the ersity, depth, confidence andstrength of those who identy as Irish citizens in the north.They represent tens of thousands of others in the north, andfrom right across Ireland, who have invested in the promise and ambition of theIrish Peace Process and Good Friday Agreement . They are articulatingthe voice of a progressive silent majority.However, they also persony a fundamental realignment withinnationalist and progressive opinion, including some sections of civic unionism.A new dangerous tipping point has been created in thepolitical process due to the destructive bigotry of the DUP the combinedefforts of both the DUP and British Government to systematically undermine theGFA, and to impose Brexit and, as a result of their toxic pact.The GFA guaranteed the delivery of equality, rights, parityof esteem and mutual respect.The DUP and others in political unionism have consistentlyopposed it from .Twenty years after the signing of the GFA it has still to befully implemented despite its status as an internationally binding agreement whichhas been laid with the United Nations.As a consequence, both the British and Irish Governments haveobligations as co-guarantors to ensure its implementation.However, the British Tory government turned its back on theGFA since it took power in .Now the DUP, British government and the most extreme elementsin political unionism are engaged in a full frontal assault against theAgreement. Brexit is the antithesis of the GFA.Its imposition will deepen the rights deficit in the northand will further destabilise the political process.That reality goes to the very heart of the existing politicalcrisis in the North, and which blocks the political institutions from beingre-established.A wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Torygovernment. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone . We don’t want to set them on a pedestal above other groups.”Earlier this year, an Irish language event hosted by then DUP Mayor of Mid and East Antrim was commended by Irish language groups.Police linking town incidents and appeal for witnesses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8692154.1541176569!/image/image.jpg","title":"mid and east antrim residents asked for views on outdoor recreation","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is calling on residents to have their say on an outdoor recreation strategy for the area.The council wants as much response as possible from clubs, groups, and lovers of the great outdoors to take part in a public consultation as they draw up proposals that will see which natural assets can be used for the benefit of residents and attract visitors to our borough.With coastline, rivers, uplands and low lands, forests, parks and open spaces, Mid and East Antirm has some of the most fantastic natural assets just waiting to be developed.To get involved, come along to one of three public consultation events, which are being led by Outdoor Recreation NI.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice. We are committed to keep that pledge.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"devine hoping to soar in russia","story":"BELFAST Gymnastics star, Ryan Devine departs for Russia this weekend to compete in the World Championships fresh from winning his maiden British title. The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-09.52.44.png","title":"last chance to cast your vote for our inspirational youth","story":"WITH just hours to go until voting comes to a close for the Inspirational Youth of the West awards, rest assured – there is still time to cast your vote.With over , online votes so far counted across  categories, our youth and their sterling work and endeavours will be honoured on Friday, November  at the Devenish Complex for the gala congratulatory evening hosted by Pamela Ballantine.

Varadkar under fire in Dail over stance on Brexit backstop   No-deal Brexit will cause chaos,warns Hain SF must end abstentionism, says veteran Cushnahan It proposes that the Commons would hold a vote on the deal on November  after a week in which the Government would line up business leaders, foreign politicians and Westminster insiders to publicly endorse Ms Mays plan.Ministers will adopt a tone of \"measured success\" but there will be no \"champagne corks popping\", it claims.However, Downing Street dismissed the document, saying it \"doesnt represent the Governments thinking\". It highlighted the \"childish language\", including a misspelling of Irish premier Leo Varadkars name.It states: \"Trying to get Varadker to support.\"A Government spokesperson said: \"The misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesnt represent the Governments thinking. You would expect the Government to have plans for all situations - to be clear, this isnt one of them.\"The plan suggests the deal should have been agreed by the Cabinet yesterday. Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, would then have announced a \"moment of decisive progress\" tomorrow.Instead, leaders in both the UK and Brussels warned that a deal was not close, and a three-hour meeting of the Cabinet resulted in no decisions being made. A second meeting is likely to be held later in the week.According to the document, No  officials are planning a cautious responsea deal is finally agreed.\"The narrative is going to be measured success, that this is good for everyone, but wont be all champagne corks popping,\" it says.The plan suggests Mrs May would give a speech at the Confederation of British Industry conference on November  at which she would say \"we have delivered on the referendum\". The Prime Minister would argue that \"this deal brings the country back together, now is the time for us all to unite behind it for the good of all our futures\".This would be followed by a week of focus on the content of the deal, with each day dedicated to a particular issue, including the economy, immigration and \"global Britain\".Business leaders and foreign dignitaries, including the Prime Minister of Japan, would be lined up to publicly support the deal. The mayor of Manchester, Labours Andy Burnham, is mentioned as another potential backer.Mrs May would also do an interview with BBC presenter David Dimbleby. The deal would be introduced in Parliament on November  and voted on by MPs on November .Of that day, the document says: \"Evening is the vote.

I was in awe, like the whole of the childrens ward who gathered around. He chatted to us and then, as he was leaving, handed me the parcel, telling me not to open it until he was gone.\"Unbeknownst to me, he was hiding behind a screen, waiting to see my reaction. I was amazed and overjoyed when I saw it was the shirt he had worn against Scotland the previous day and then George came back in to pose for aphotograph I treasure to this day.\"It was a fantastic experience for a football and Man United mad boy and an incredible gesture by George, which I was later to discover was typical of him.\"John has kept the shirt securely under wraps at his Glengormley home for the last five decades, bringing it out only briefly for those TV appearances.Now he has finally been persuaded to loan the shirt for a first public viewing by Georges fans since that  game.Windrose owner Gary Callaghan, a United season ticket holder and Best devotee, believes interest in the collection reflects the still massive fascination with the football hero who died in , aged just .Gary said: \"We are indebted to John for allowing us to display such an iconic shirt, not seen in public since that historic game.\"We know how much it means to him. Likewise the personal items loaned to us by Georges sister Barbara McNarry and her husband Norman, the renowned collector of United memorabilia Ray Adler, and the authors of the book, George Best: A Celebration, Bernie Smith and Maureen Hunt.\"Oscar winning producer Stephen Evans is also flying in from London. He is making a film about George, similar to his acclaimed one on Seve Ballesteros.\"This is an exhibition with a dference in that it personalises George and tells his story. Exhibits will include handwritten letters home to his family when he was a Man United apprentice, his school reports and driving licence.\"Some never seen before trophies, medals, photographs, match-worn football shirts and fashion items will also be on display, including a shirt made by the famous designer Paul Smith when he was just starting out.\"Barbara McNarry, who has endorsed the exhibition of her legend brothers personal belongings, said: \"We are so excited. There have been many exhibitions about George the footballer but this one will allow his fans to learn about George the man.\"The event includes a themed lunch based on The Best family sausages as famously advertised by George on TV for Cookstown in the Seventies, viewing of the Manchester derby, and a question and answer session by Sammy McIlroy with UTVs Ruth Gorman.Tickets, £  £, are available from the Windrose "},{"url":null,"title":"ira army council does not exist as it is no longer needed murray","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But speaking to the Belfastafterwards, he said that the IRAs ruling body was not needed because mainstream republican groups were not involved in criminal behaviour.This came despite PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton saying in June that the structures of the IRA remained in place. Mr Murray said: \"I dont accept theres an Army Council.\"I dont see any manestation of mainstream republican links to coercive control of my own community.\"Such behaviour would be counterproductive.\"Its the reason loyalism never got a foothold in politics.\"People reject those involved in such activities at the ballot box.\"The ex-prisoner also said he was vindicated by the Public Prosecution Servicesdecision on Monday not to prosecute him on charges of smuggling firearms here from Florida between  and  due to insufficient evidence.\"There are no foundations to these allegations and that has been proved by the PPS,\" he added.\"There is no case to answer, and I have consistently said that from day one.\" The allegations were made in a  BBC Spotlight programme that claimed he conspired with Florida businessman Mike Logan to import a large consignment of Glock handguns. Mr Logan died in .Addressing the question of how to tackle \"scary levels\" of paramilitary behaviour on both sides of the community, Mr Murray said complex problems could prove to be \"a very potent mix\" amid the most polarised political climate since the ceasefire.He warned it could create \"a perfect storm\". \"We have no governance, politics isnt delivering and we have the onslaught of Brexit.\" he said.\"Another poisonous relationship is that between the Tory Government and the DUP.\" However, he agreed with PUP councillor Dr John Kyle, who said drug use was a major issue which fuels paramilitary activity. Mr Murray warned drugs can also result in extortion. \"Criminal gangs will go to a family and say: Your son or daughter is involved in drug dealing. And then demand a ransom of thousands of pounds,\" he said. Other lists expressed frustration over the reluctance of \"risk averse\" civil servants to allocate money in the absence of ministers and fears over the \"huge uncertainty\" around Brexit and stalemate on legacy issues.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

He had spent time with his mother but when it came to being independent he failed. He just didnrsquot know how to eat fish. It took us about a week to show him how.After an initial assessment, each seal began their journey to rehabilitation receiving extensive medical care, to ensure infections were kept at bay and housed in hospital pen whilst learning how to eat fish.Once they reached about kg and could self-feed, they were moved to the outdoor pools where they learnt how to socialise with other seals.At this stage, all human contact was kept to a minimum to ensure a successful re-introduction to the sea.Two days before their release, the seals were discharged from the seal unit as they had successfully reached their target weight of over kg and were in good health, ready to take on adult le in the wild.Ms Robinson said that Knockinelder Cove provides a great area for the pupsrsquo first few hours to get used to having no walls as they swim.ldquoWe never release a seal on its own and through our weekly weigh-in, we can identy release lsquoteamsrsquo such as Loki, Freya and Juno being our first for this season, she added.Ahead of the release all seals are tagged on their rear flipper to help identy them.Over time this will be used to see how rehabbed seals influence the wild population through breeding.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Tuam controversy is part of a larger episode in Irish history that focuses on the treatment of unmarried mothers and their children. However the story is not only pertinent in the Republic of Ireland – Northern Ireland has its own hidden history in this respect. A stark advertisement that appeared in the Northern Whig in  is evidence of this. Sitting alongside notices about second hand cars is a notice that reads: ‘Bonny Baby Boy: full surrender given to kind Protestant parents - Box PM.’ In an era when stigma was attached to pre-marital pregnancy, how did Northern Ireland respond to this issue Professor Sean O’Connell from Queen’s University Belfast said: “We know very little about this and the babies involved are part of a hidden history. “This advert suggests an ad hoc and furtive process took place, certainly at this point – .”He added: “We estimate that up to , Northern Irish women were sent to homes operated by Protestant churches, including Thorndale, Malone Place, Hopedene Hostel and Kennedy House between the s and s. “A further ,, from the Catholic community, had their babies while residents of the Marianvale in Newry and Marianville in Belfast, which were operated by the Catholic Sisters of the Good Shepherd.“In total, that is , women: each with their own story. “Moreover, there are a further , potential stories to be told of what became of their babies. “We are currently recording the memoires of some of those women and their children and would like to appeal to News Letter readers to help us secure even more.”“We have been asked to discover the reality that lies behind the sketchy historical evidence on mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland that can be found in the dusty paperwork left behind. UDR double murder suspect Downey remanded in custodyMillions of pensioners have no-one to turn to, says report Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Our research will lead to a report for the Department of Health which will feed into a decision on whether or not Northern Ireland follows the Republic and instigates a full scale inquiry on mother and baby homes.”Over the course of the past century, hundreds of women made the journey from their homes across Northern Ireland to a number of mother and baby homes run by Catholic and Protestant organisations, as well as by the state.A smaller number of residential homes operated as so-called Magdalene laundries and a large number of women worked in them, for ious s of time.Working alongside Professor O’Connell on the examination of the mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland is Dr Leanne McCormick from Ulster University.She said: “The mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland were, in general, for unmarried mothers who were not able to remain in their family home for the birth of their child. “Women entered the homes in the months before their due date and stayed for ying s of time after they gave birth, depending on what was happening with their baby.“Some women ed home with their baby or moved in with relatives and friends, but the majority of babies born in mother and baby homes were given up for adoption, or placed in foster care or orphanages. “Society was a lot harsher and more judgemental in this period and being pregnant and unmarried often carried stigma and shame. “Sadly,we know that many women were left unsupported by their families. “Being left alone and afraid they may have felt unable tohome with their baby. “Alternatively, they may feel that pressure was placed upon them to give up their baby for adoption.”She said: “There were a wide iety of homes involved. Before the creation of the NHS, in , the workhouse often operated as a type of mother and baby home for unmarried mothers. “There were  workhouses in Northern Ireland and many operated ‘boarding out’ schemes, which were a form of fostering children, and mothers often were required to pay for the up-keep of children who were boarded out. “The workhouses often organised adoptions as well.” The research team also want to record interviews with anyone who worked in a mother and baby home or a Magdalene laundry in Northern Ireland, or who gained knowledge of these institutions because of their work. This could include those working in the following categories at any point before the s: Members of religious orders, clergy, social workers, doctors, nurses and others.Dr McCormick continued: “Many women have never spoken about their time in these homes and may never have told their husbands or their children about the experience.“With mother and baby homes in the news once again, we hope that some of these women will feel ready and willing to come forward now and share their stories with us. “The process is completely confidential and anonymity is guaranteed. All interviewees are treated with the care and respect they deserve.” She commented: “We are aware that they were made to feel shame at the time when they were giving birth to their babies, now they have the opportunity to help us write the non-judgemental historical account. “Our research can be assisted greatly by anyone who had any contact with any of these institutions other than as a resident. “To fully understand the operation of the homes we would appeal to any doctors, nurses, or midwives who encountered women from the homes during their work or a member of the clergy who referred women to the homes.”The examination of mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland has been commissioned by the Department of Health after the Executive admitted there was limited knowledge about their operation in Northern Ireland.Professor Sean O’Connell from the School of History, Anthropology, Philosophy and Politics at Queen’s University and Dr Leanne McCormick from the School of Arts and Humanities at Ulster University are leading the research team on the -month project.Researchers will examine archive records held by the state, churches and relevant voluntary organisations with the primary task of preparing a detailed report on the day-to-day operation and practices within Northern Ireland’s mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries.The report’s finding will inform future deliberations about a possible public inquiry on the subject.The Salvation Army carried out maternity work at Thorndale in Belfast until  and Malone Place, operated by the Belfast Midnight Mission, ran from  until it was closed in , providing for both married and unmarried mothers. The Church of Ireland Rescue League worked with unmarried mothers at Kennedy House until it closed in . Another Church of Ireland home – Hopedene Hostel on Dundela Avenue – ran from  to . For Catholic women, the options included Marianville in Belfast and Marianvale in Newry in . The Legion of Mary also ran a home – Mater Dei – on the Antrim Road from  to .The interviews in relations to Northern Ireland’s mother and baby homes will be carried out by experienced oral historians, Olivia Dee and Professor Sean O’Connell.They can be contacted by phone on  , email MBHML@qub.ac.uk or by post to Professor Sean O’Connell, Queen’s University Belfast,  University Square, Belfast BT NN.The homes which they are interested in are: • Good Shepherd Sistersat  Ormeau Road, Belfast and , Armagh Road, Newry• Mater Dei Hostel -  Antrim Road, Belfast• Belfast Midnight Mission Malone Place Rescue and Maternity Home - Malone Road, Belfast• Thorndale House- Duncairn Avenue, Belfast• Kennedy House -  Cltonville Avenue, Belfast,• Hopedene Hostel -  Dundela Avenue• Belfast Welfare Hostel - Lisburn Road, Belfast• Coleraine Welfare Hostel• Mount Oriel Hostel -  Mount Oriel, Belfast• Deanery Flatlets - Belfast• Pre- Workhousestry catch     .               ..

Our own campaign for truth regarding the Hyde Park atrocity has reminded the authorities as to their responsibilities - justice must be done.”   Mark Tipper of the Hyde Park Justice campaign at the memorial to his brother Simon and other soldiers who were killed in the  IRA bomb attack in London. Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, , Lieutenant Dennis Daly, , Trooper Simon Tipper, , and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, , were killed by an IRA car bomb as they rode through the central London park in .Convicted IRA member Mr Downey - who has always denied any involvement in the attack - was charged four years ago with the murders, but the prosecution collapsed as he had an On-The-Run comfort letter.However relatives of the four Cavalrymen then launched a civil action against Downey for damages. Mr Tipper said the Hyde Park Justice campaign was focused on those responsible for that atrocity: “The people who think they can break the law and Tony Blair, who thinks he can offer OTR letters to suspected terrorists”.   James Eames, one of two part-time UDR soldiers who were killed by the IRA bomb in Fermanagh in  It is understood thatDowney is extradited from the south and prosecuted for the Fermanagh murders, this will not prevent the Hyde Park civil proceedings from advancing and that the case will to go to trial next October as ordered and scheduled by the High Court last week.House of Commons figures show that the Republic refused to extradite  per cent of people wanted for terrorist offences in the UK in the  years from -.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"donegall house on sale for m","story":"Posted on Thursday November  by Ulster Business A prominent Belfast building has gone on the market for offers over £.m, it can be revealed.Donegall House, which sits across from City Hall on Donegall Square, is now being marketed by Osborne King and CBRE.Built in , the building was refurbished in . It current plays host to tenants including Nationside, Barclays, Davy and Hays Recruitment.There is also a suggestion that a further , sq ft could be added over the building’s seven storeys, subject to planning permission.Some of the other business tenants include a small Kaffe O coffee kiosk, and Space NK.Gavin Clarke, director of investment at Osborne King, said while a few UK-based investment funds have looked at the building, it could go to someone closer to home.“It’s a landmark building – it’s the first time it’s been on the market in  years.“I thinkcould be local. We have had a few UK-based funds look at it to date. It’s still early days.”Meanwhile, a number of other major commercial property deals were completed in the third quarter of the year, according to a new report from CBRE.That includes Laharna Retail Park in Larne, which sold for £.m.And a number of other large business parks and buildings are also now on sale. That includes Crescent Link Retail Park in Derry, on sale for £.m, Antrim Business Park for £.m and The Boat building in Belfast city centre – on the market for £.m.According to CBRE, there were  major commercial lettings in the third quarter of the year, across , sq ft of space.That included Firstsource, which is taking almost , sq ft of space at - Fountain Street, which had been home to Concentrix.Meanwhile, construction workloads edged upwards in the third quarter of the year, despite a “marked decline in infrastructure and public sector work”.That’s according to the latest survey from RICSand Tughans.Jim Sammon, RICS Northern Ireland construction spokesman, said: “While it is encouraging that we are seeing rises in the private housing, private commercial sector and public housing subsectors, the picture across other areas, particularly infrastructure, continues to cause concern.“The fact that infrastructure and public non housing workloads are in decline gives an indication of the impact the lack of decision-making in government is having on the ground.And Michael McCord, head of construction, Tughans, said: “In some respects it appears that there is a two-tier construction market at present, with some private sector activity forging ahead, while surveyors report declines in infrastructure and other publicly-funded activity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Brian-1121.jpg","title":"brian mcgrath we were swept up in a national brexit debate which wasnt relevant for us","story":"Posted on Friday November  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew speaks to Foyle Port chief executive Brian McGrath about sharing UK and Irish waters, the burden of increased bureaucracy but looking at a potential Brexit silver-lining coming down the line There’s a surprising air of optimism surrounding Brian McGrath when it comes to the UK’s exit from the EU.While the Foyle Port chief believes the £m business – which handles around £.bn in commodities each year – could feel the bureaucratic hand of a post-Brexit environment, such as delays, paperwork and a potential “logjam”, that it’s in a unique position, sharing both UK and Irish waters.But he believes the Irish border was a mere “second thought” when Brexit campaigning was at its height – instead, focused around an emotional argument around immigration. A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
