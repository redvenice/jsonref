It rained the entire day long. It was cold, it was miserable, it was wet.\u0027The young Prince had to dress up in a kilt, black jacket and white lace jabot for the Royal Family procession into Westminster Abbey.          Pictured: Michael Crawford at 11Actor Michael Crawford was an 11-year-old schoolboy when he watched the occasion with his family in The Mall. He tells the programme: ‘This brought our country together – it’s very stirring, moving and brings out great pride.’Looking at his scrapbook from the time about the Coronation he admits: ‘It was a passion. Everything I could find in the newspapers I cut out.’Crawford, above, who went on to find fame on television and stage, says: ‘You see thousands of soldiers and it’s the pageantry, the uniforms, the regalia… There was this extraordinary spectacle.’                                                    Watching film commissioned by the Queen to record the atmosphere inside Buckingham Palace on the day, he says: \u0027Imagine the build-up and the excitement. A great deal of hustle and bustle and fiddling around making sure things were put on the right way round. I remember how glamorous the Queen looked, this radiant figure.\u0027In one sequence, a line of carriages in the Palace courtyard prepare to transport members of the Royal Family and VIPs including Winston Churchill to the Abbey.The Prince recalls the journey in a carriage with his mother, Princess Marina, his sister, Princess Alexandra, and brother, the Duke of Kent. \u0027There was an enormous crowd and they had periscopes, a lot of them, which were strange-looking devices where you looked through a viewer, and it then went up and you could look over the heads of the people in front of you… \u0027So you had a forest of these strange-looking things which were sticking out from the crowd.\u0027The sight of the Queen\u0027s four-ton Gold State Coach with eight grey horses also transfixed him.\u0027I don\u0027t think there are very often occasions where eight greys pull a coach. You have to have as many as that because the Coronation coach weighs so much.\u0027The Prince, 75, adds: \u0027It was a wonderful occasion and it\u0027s amazing to think we are here all these years later.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Coronation In Colour is on ITV tomorrow at 9pm.

The Tunisian coastguard is pictured on patrol off the northern town of Bizerte in MayThe latest death toll was published around 7pm, after the search and rescue operation had ended for the day.The hunt for survivors would continue on Monday morning, Mohammed Salah Sagaama from Sfax\u0027s naval base told AFP.Tunisians and migrants regularly try to cross the Mediterranean to seek a better future in Europe, with 120 mainly Tunisians rescued by their navy in March after trying to reach Italy.In October, a collision between a migrant boat and a Tunisian military ship left at least 44 dead, in what Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called a \u0027national disaster\u0027.The latest shipwreck is the most deadly in the Mediterranean since February 2 when 90 people drowned off the coast of Libya, according to the IOM.Across the Mediterranean, nine Syrians including seven children drowned when their vessel sank off the coast of Turkey.The group were travelling in a speedboat intending to head illegally to Europe, when the boat hit trouble off the coast of the southern Antalya province, state media reports said.  Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE2777800000578-0-image-a-54_1528057464925.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr pictured outside Utah home looking disheveled","story":"    Roseanne Barr was pictured looking disheveled outside her Salt Lake City, Utah home on Sunday afternoon   The disgraced television star has rarely been seen since she was fired for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett on Tuesday Wolf was less than impressed that the network swiftly fired Barr after she called Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027Everyone\u0027s been saying it\u0027s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on air in the first place,\u0027 Wolf said on her Netflix show The Break.\u0027So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they\u0027ve been openly racist for the thousandth time.\u0027The \u0027lady Hitler chef\u0027 nickname references a controversial 2009 photo shoot in which Barr dressed up as a Nazi baking cookies shaped like humans.

There are also mark-ups on pizza, pasta, drinks and children’s meals at Bella Italia and Strada.It has long been known that Center Parcs hits parents in the pocket by putting up prices at its five UK holiday centres as soon as the schools break for the summer at the end of July.          What is less well known is that the prices to stay at the UK parks, with their woodland lodges, lakes, pools, and sports facilities, are so much higher than the prices in Europe.The UK and European parks are separate businesses, but the accommodation, facilities and services are similar. UK parks offer three levels of accommodation: woodland lodges, executive lodges and exclusive lodges.The standard lodges have a family bathroom, kitchen, TV, wood burner and patio. The top of range options add en-suite bathrooms, housekeeping services, a sauna, a hot tub and, generally, a games room with a pool table. A family of four staying for seven nights at a woodland lodge in Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, at the start of August would have to fork out £1,958.That is more than double the price of £909 for similar accommodation at the German Center Parc at Hochsauerland, in Medebach.It is also some £930 more than a premium cottage at the De Vossemeren park, in Lommel, Belgium, which is around £1,027.The holiday company was set up by a Dutch entrepreneur and later bought by the British brewing and hospitality chain Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle. It sold the European part of the business to a French holiday company and German investment group in 2003.          The British business was subsequently bought by the American private equity firm Blackstone.Consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs The Complaining Cow website, said: ‘It is really shocking that British families can be charged hundreds of pounds more than those in Europe for what is effectively an identikit holiday, but this is typical of rip-off Britain.’ Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, was particular critical of the higher food prices. ‘Families have already paid a lot of money for their Center Parcs stay and will be rightly upset to find they are being charged inflated prices for the food at chain restaurants on site,’ he said.A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs UK is a separate company to Center Parcs Europe we operate in very different market conditions.‘We heavily reinvest in our accommodation, activities and restaurants each year and our pricing is based purely on demand for the short break experience we offer in the UK, which does differ from Center Parcs Europe significantly.’Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas are all part of a company called the Casual Dining Group.A spokesman said: ‘As is common practice across many retail businesses, such as car dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK, we operate a range of different price brackets across our brands, dependent on where a site is located.’Strada did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/10/4CDECA9700000578-0-image-a-6_1528018447154.jpg","title":"Pubs Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags World Cup bunting","story":"    The Air Balloon pub in Filton, Bristol.

That could explain why newly appointed director of the KPA\u0027s General Political Bureau, Army General Kim Su Gil, accompanied Kim Jong Un on a field guidance trip to a beach tourist zone with other officials, Madden said.

We must evolve too,\u0027 he will say to an audience of counter-terrorism experts, according to excerpts released by the Home Office.The new strategy \u0027incorporates the lessons learnt from the attacks in 2017 and our responses to them\u0027.Under the new blueprint, the security services will be alerted to suspicious purchases more swiftly.The government want firms to raise the alarm as quickly as possible if they have evidence of unusual transactions - such as someone stockpiling large amounts of chemicals or acting suspiciously when hiring a vehicle.Javid will also identify \u0027extreme right-wing terrorism\u0027 as an increasing threat and note similarities to the Islamic State group.It will be his first major speech on security since becoming home secretary in April following the resignation of Amber Rudd over the Windrush immigration scandal.The son of Pakistani parents who emigrated to Britain in the 1960s, he will touch on his own background to address the issue.\u0027There\u0027s one other thing that Islamists and the far right have in common,\u0027 he will say. \u0027As a Home Secretary with a name like Sajid Javid - I\u0027m everything they despise.\u0027So the way I see it, I must be doing something right.\u0027 Police facing surge in extremists released from jail, analysis finds | UK news | The Guardian"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/16/4CE0B89700000578-0-image-m-3_1528041365647.jpg","title":"Lily Allen wears AK 47 necklace performs Londons Hoopla Festival","story":"The pop star, who is staging a come back with a new album, was seen wearing the pendant as she performed at the Mighty Hoopla Festival in Brockwell Park in London on Sunday eveningSemi-professional boxer Oluwafemi Omosuyi, known as Femi, was gunned down outside Oliver Goldsmith Primary in Peckham, south London, on Saturday night.The shooting took place just three miles away from the festival.Dramatic moment knife-wielding man is shot near the altar of...\u0027I want to kill a white person\u0027: Dramatic moment armed...Mother\u0027s two young children watch in horror as she is shot...West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini and his wife are mugged...Share this articleHe was blasted with a shotgun in the upper body and received pellet wounds to the face just before 8pm on Wodehouse Avenue, sparking an armed police response. In a gruesome video crowds of onlookers hover over a man, believed to be Mr Omosuyi, with blood gushing from his face.It is unclear if Ms Allen\u0027s necklace was a comment on the violence or merely a fashion statement.

Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE2777800000578-0-image-a-54_1528057464925.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr pictured outside Utah home looking disheveled","story":"    Roseanne Barr was pictured looking disheveled outside her Salt Lake City, Utah home on Sunday afternoon   The disgraced television star has rarely been seen since she was fired for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett on Tuesday Wolf was less than impressed that the network swiftly fired Barr after she called Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027Everyone\u0027s been saying it\u0027s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on air in the first place,\u0027 Wolf said on her Netflix show The Break.\u0027So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they\u0027ve been openly racist for the thousandth time.\u0027The \u0027lady Hitler chef\u0027 nickname references a controversial 2009 photo shoot in which Barr dressed up as a Nazi baking cookies shaped like humans.

A report today found that the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 a fridge freezer in the flat\u0027s kitchen. A series of expert reports today showed how flammable cladding and muddled fire safety plans exacerbated the impact of the blaze          The report found there were a number of electrical appliances around the fridge which may have sparked the blaze  Officials said the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 the fridge-freezer, but could not be sure whether a fault with the device was the cause of the fire or whether it started in another of the kitchen\u0027s many electrical items          A photo taken during the investigation shows an electrical cooking device between the fridge freezer and the window  The report quotes a statement from one of the flat\u0027s three residents, Behailu Kebede. He raised the alarm after being woken by a fire alarm and finding smoke in his kitchenThe recording was played after the publication of a damning report found the cladding put on the outside of the building did not comply \u0027with recommended fire performance\u0027 and criticised the \u0027stay-put\u0027 policy which encouraged residents to remain in their flats in the event of the fire.Fire-safety engineer Barbara Lane said the fire service\u0027s  policy had \u0027effectively failed\u0027 barely a half-hour after the fire started, but residents weren\u0027t told to evacuate for more than an hour after that.The cladding meant the fire spread up seven storeys within seven minutes,  with 70 flats ablaze in under two hours. The disaster was compounded by non-compliant fire doors, combustible window fittings and a faulty firefighting lift. Ms Lane said that a renovation of the building completed in 2016 installed flammable  cladding on the tower\u0027s facade which led to \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this article\u0027The assembly failed adequately to resist the spread of fire\u0027 to an extent that would have support a \u0027stay put\u0027 policy, she said.Ms Lane said there had been \u0027a culture of non-compliance\u0027 with safety regulations, and identified multiple failures.The \u0027stay put\u0027 guidance which was given to residents before the fire was eventually abandoned at 2.47am - around two hours after the fire started.Ms Lane\u0027s report said it is unclear why there was such a gap between the advice being rendered redundant and the fire service changing tack, the report said.\u0027I am particularly concerned by the delay from 2.06am, when a major incident was declared, to 2.47am,\u0027 Dr Lane continued.           A photo of the flat once the debris had been cleared away shows how the other electrical items added to the damage done          Burn marks show the area beneath where the fridge-freezer stood. The skirting board behind the appliance had burned away          The fire started in the kitchen of the two-bedroom flat. The kitchen had sliding doors which opened onto the living room, pictured, where one of the flat\u0027s three occupants lived          The floor of flat 16\u0027s kitchen was strewn with wreckage of kitchen appliances when investigators got inside. The partition where sliding doors had led to the living room was almost completely burned away          Three people lived in the flat at the time of blaze. Two women had a bedroom each and a man lived in the living room  A picture taken through the front door of the flat (left) shows limited damage to the entrance hallway. As firefighters moved towards the kitchen however, the fire was much more intense, scorching the hallway leading to the kitchen (right)          Grainy images taken from body cameras worn by firefighters show the moment they opened to door to the kitchen fire          Images of the fridge freezer show what are described as \u0027unknown items\u0027 between it and window out of which flames spreadA separate report on how the fire stared states that Mr Kebede, referred to the fridge in his first call to emergency services. He told the call handler: \u0027Fire in flat 16, Grenfell Tower... the fridge, flat 16, Grenfell Tower.\u0027The report also contains statements from the first and second pairs of firefighters to enter the property.One of the first pair, Daniel Brown, said he saw an \u0027isolated curtain of flame from about two to three feet into the air to the ceiling\u0027. One of the second pair of firefighters, John O\u0027Hanlon, said: \u0027The fridge was on the right, quite close to the window. You wouldn\u0027t recognise it as a fridge, just a charred rectangle with a bit of melted stuff at the bottom that was still alight.\u0027The window had gone by then, broken. That\u0027s when we noticed the window had completely gone. Even the frame wasn\u0027t there and we noticed that it was on fire, that the window surround was on fire.\u0027We walked over to the window and started spraying the window frame. It didn\u0027t have any effect on it, at which point I sat of the window sill and was leaning out trying to hit what I thought was the window surround.\u0027            The plan show the flat. The fire started in the south-east corner, the bottom right of the image          An estimated picture of the layout of the kitchen shows a number of appliances around the freezer where the blaze started          A plan of the fourth floor shows there were five other flats on that storey of the building. Flat 16 resident Mr Kebede said he woke neigbours after discovering the blazeBut University of Dundee Professor Niamh Daeid wrote: \u0027On the basis of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the area of origin of the fire was in, or around, the tall fridge freezer in the southeast part of the kitchen.\u0027The cause of the fire remains undetermined although, based on the available information, it is more likely than not to be an accidental cause rather than a deliberate act.\u0027The originating fire within flat 16 extended out of the kitchen window of the flat and at some point re-entered through the window of the bedroom next to the living room of flat 16 causing further damage to the flat.\u0027 In a departure from information given by the Met Police, another expert said there was \u0027insufficient evidence\u0027 that the fire was started by the fridge-freezer.In another separate report, Professor Luke Bisby, from the University of Edinburgh, wrote: \u0027Some evidence exists to support a hypothesis that the fire started in the south-east side of the kitchen and in the general area of the Hotpoint FF175P fridge-freezer, however, there is currently insufficient evidence, even based on a balance of probabilities, in my opinion, to support the hypothesis that the fire originated in the fridge-freezer, and to exclude all other potential sources of ignition.\u0027With regard to other possible sources of ignition, I have not seen sufficiently convincing evidence to confidently identify the origin of the initial fire.\u0027 Shocking footage shows how a fire which started in a kitchen of a Grenfell Tower flat leapt up the side of the building. The left hand image is timed at 1.08am, not long after the blaze began. By 1.12am the fire had already started to growIn clips estimated to have been filmed between 1.16 and 1.20am, burning debris could be seen falling from the tower, and screaming could be heard.\u0027I told you, I told you get out,\u0027 one man could be heard shouting in a further clip.Six clips showing the side of the tower as it became engulfed with flames were shown side by side.\u0027Oh my god,\u0027 one woman said as huge pieces of fiery debris rained down from the blazing tower.Another could be heard sobbing as it became apparent the fire was out of control.After the video was shown, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said: \u0027It is truly shocking, every time you see it, it strikes you in a very similar way, very strongly.\u0027   This image, timed at 1.15 am, shows how, helped by flammable cladding and window materials, the fire began to grow  By 1:24am (left), the flames were burning through flats on multiple floors. An image taken from footage filmed around 1.28am (right) shows how, aided by what a report called \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027, the fire reached the top                                                      More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did nothing and a shambolic \u0027stay put\u0027 policy: Litany of Grenfell safety failings that led to a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027           \u0027Stay put\u0027 advice to Grenfell Tower residents from the emergency services that was in place for almost two hours after the fire began was a \u0027total failure\u0027 according to an expert witness. Pictured are ambulance teams at the scene of the blazeDeadly doors and cladding coupled with advice to victims stay in their flats as Grenfell Tower was engulfed by fire caused a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027, the inquiry into Britain\u0027s worst blaze in living memory revealed today.Expert witness Dr Barbara Lane decried the \u0027stay put\u0027 advice given by the emergency services to residents trapped in the burning building as a \u0027total failure\u0027 and \u0027substantially to blame for the tragedy\u0027.Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed it took one hour and 11 minutes for the authorities to change their minds and start an evacuation.But by then there was little hope of escaping the tower, which was engulfed in flames in just 20 minutes.Dr Lane also spoke of a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 at Grenfell, which had there were more than 100 non-compliant fire doors, a firefighting lift that didn\u0027t work and a tinderbox cladding system and draughty windows that accelerated the blaze. Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed that it took one hour and 11 minutes between when it became clear the safety advice had failed and when it officially changed to tell residents to leave.The advice from the emergency services was in place for almost two hours and was repeatedly told to those inside ringing 999 for help.Dr Lane wrote in her report that this failure \u0027would have materially affected the ability or willingness of occupants to escape independently through this space to the stair\u0027.It would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.          \u0027Non compliant\u0027 fire doors were also blamed for the spread of the flames while firefighters \u0027may have contributed\u0027 by leaving doors openIn 2011, the Tenant Management Organisation - which ran the building - replaced 106 flat entrance fire doors. None of the doors on any of the 120 flats - including the 14 not replaced - were compliant with the fire test evidence relied upon at the time of installation, Dr Lane found.These shortcomings would have had a number of consequences, including failure to prevent the spread of smoke and flame by leakage through gaps between the door leaf and door frame.Another failure of an \u0027unknown number of doors\u0027 to self-close after an occupant escaped would have allowed \u0027immediate\u0027 spread of fire and smoke.  A table from the report on the spread of the blaze shows how quickly the number of flat affected rose The lobbies could therefore not be used as a \u0027safe air environment\u0027 by the fire service bridgehead, forcing it to remain below level 4 until 7.30am.\u0027This greatly reduced the time available using breathing apparatus, and so the time available for rescue on the upper floors, and particularly above Level 15.\u0027Firefighters may also have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, Dr Lane found.She wrote: \u0027I have identified the fact that the firefighting operations in response to the multi-storey fire may have contributed to the failure of the stair fire doors to prevent fire and smoke spread.\u0027Current evidence indicates some of the stair doors were ajar as firefighting hoses were running from the stair into the lobby. However, I currently do not know the number of doors involved, nor which specific doors, nor for how long this opening may have occurred. I cannot yet conclude whether this made a significant contribution.\u0027In one case, a fire door to the stairwell was held open by a body, the report said.The expert\u0027s evidence also blamed the building\u0027s windows for allowing the fire to spread to the combustible cladding, which led to its rapid spread up the tower.She said the window frames were not protected with fire resistant barriers but instead with \u0027combustible materials\u0027 allowing the blaze to expand unchecked.

A table from a report published today shows how quickly flats were engulfedDr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, delivered an excoriating assessment of the refurbishment which finished a year before the fire.The rainscreen cladding put on the building used material that did not meet fire safety standards, while the system as a whole was not capable of effectively preventing the inferno spreading.In a report published on Monday, Dr Lane wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027Windows in inidual flats had no fire barriers encasing them and these openings were surrounded by combustible material, the expert found.Such a shortcoming \u0027increased the likelihood of that fire breaking into the large cavities contained within the cladding system\u0027 and provided \u0027no means to control the spread of fire and smoke\u0027.The gap beyond the window, in turn, was supposed to have fire-stops at intervals which would halt the advance of flames - but these were installed incorrectly.There was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.

Like them, it was unprecedented for its era, and era-forming. In it Dunn idiomatically transcribes nine informal interviews she recorded with young women she happened to be around in the year 1964, friends across the class system, from factory worker Kathy Collier to socialite heiress Suna Portman, with a particular eye to women marking themselves out creatively, against the odds. “These girls,” according to Dunn’s preface, share more than just a common time and age they’ve each “severed themselves from some of the conventional forms of\u0026nbspliving and thinking”.Dunn began writing fiction in the late 1950s, composing a number of short vignettes around the everyday life and people she met when she moved to Battersea and began working in a sweet factory. After leaving convent school at 14, and with an education picked up here and there across the world, she had crossed the river away from her own upper-class background from Chelsea to Battersea and settled there.Some of these short pieces went on to form the body of Up the Junction. Its subject matter, its sexual frankness and its marked unsentimentality, its refusal to provide any fake narrative payoff, and its\u0026nbsprevelation of working-class power – especially its\u0026nbspportrayal of the forthrightness of working-class women – ignited a public reaction part scandalised, part ecstatic. It became a runaway bestseller.Dunn was drawn, from the start, to shared talk. Her art is ignited by voice, especially by voice more usually given no societal, literary or aesthetic power or space but whose authority, as you hear it, is unquestionable. In the early 60s the breakthrough radicalism of Up the Junction lay in to whom it gave voice as\u0026nbspwell as what it voiced, at a time when such things just weren’t done, just weren’t said.“I like talking,” its heiress-turned-factory-worker character tells a casual male lover. It’s a rare moment of the narrator’s voice surfacing Dunn’s narrative voice is more usually a fusion-delivery of the voices (female and male) round her and also of the sounds and sights of the time: a fragment of pop song, a bird singing above an empty house on an old bomb site, the shreds of words and colours on an advertising hoarding so that reading becomes a kind of sensory collage, a listening vision, one that reveals the ironies, truths, comedies, foulnesses, the losses, the cruelties, the sometimes funny sometimes fuck-you survival, the social and natural realities, in an unforced transcribing, life drawn from the life.“We had this woman from the WVS come to tell us what to do if they dropped the H-bomb on us. ‘First\u0026nbspthing,’ she says: ‘fill your bath with water’. ‘We haven’t got no bath, love,’ I says. That put her right in it.”Talking, naturally (as well as talking naturally), is one of the central preoccupations of Talking to Women. Dunn asks about morality, politics, economic survival. She asks about life lived with or without the having of children, whether this is a choice or a desire, and the economics of it. She asks about marriage: is it out of date? She asks repeatedly about the meaning of passion and whether her interviewees think passion is about sex, whether they “think sex is tremendously important”. She asks if they’re frightened of\u0026nbspdying. She asks about hope. She asks about love. She\u0026nbspasks about class, creativity, domesticity and the everyday politics of role. She asks nine young women in their 20s or just touching 30 what they imagine the future will bring them. The answers they give are “as\u0026nbspvaried as being alive”.What comes to light, even as Ann (the experimental novelist Ann Quin) is saying the words “verbally we can’t really communicate”, and Edna (O’Brien) is commenting on how “most people are ashamed of saying what’s close to them”, and Emma (Charlton) is lamenting how “human beings are totally inequipped” and endlessly stymied by “this inability to communicate about things you really care about”, is the unashamed intimacy, the articulacy of each speaker, up against the pressure on each one, the pressure even just on language.Sex is “only another language to me”, Antonia (Simon) says.“Passion to me involves communication on all levels,” Ann says.“By actually marrying someone you’re saying something that you can’t say in any other way,” says Pauline (Boty, the artist) who’s recently married her husband only days after they met because “he accepted me intellectually ... the first man I could really talk very freely to ... someone who liked women and to whom they weren’t kind of things”.Every one of the women interviewed knows that role, and especially gender role, pressurises what it’s acceptable or possible to say. Emma is articulate about how playing the role currently expected of her reduces both men and women. “Even if I think they are unattractive I often say things which I know it would suit them to hear. But really that’s a form of looking down on them.”Frances (Chadwicke) knows what she thinks about “dreadful things in women’s magazines making it appear that the whole point of a woman’s life is the time when she’s attractive to a man” she connects this to “being brought up to feel a second class citizen, inferior to a man in every way, encouraged to think of oneself as the object of a man’s pursuit and therefore with no vital life of your own”.Edna, whose “first and initial body thoughts were blackened by the fear of sin”, in a kind of echo-response to Frances, comments that “a man must feel very sad when he can’t impregnate every desirable woman in the world”.It’s a witty read: “How can a man be unfaithful in your handknitted jumper?”  “I’ve often thought what I really need is a wife.”It’s an anarchic read: “The older you get the less need there is for society’s morality, because you have established your own fierce rigorous morality.”It reveals the guilts, the\u0026nbspsocial and economic inequalities, the fragilities and insecurities, and the courage simply in the act of speaking at all, of every one of the women interviewed. Dunn asks Ann whether she regrets having had an abortion (still illegal till 1967 – the impact of Dunn’s writing is one of the reasons the abortion laws shifted and changed). It takes an experimental novelist like Quin to formulate choice out of no choice : “It was something that I’d chosen to do, and there seemed no\u0026nbspalternative therefore I went ahead and did it.”This book’s brilliance lies on the one hand in the excoriating frankness of each speaker, and on the other in its gift of what’s beneath what’s being said. “You know, a man in bed at night, and cornflakes and\u0026nbspall that. I think I despise it as well as wanting it.” The interview with Edna reveals a young thinker wise\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspboth her own and society’s fantasies.“I thought about gassing myself,” Kathy says. “It’d cost you two or three bob in the meter,” Dunn says. It’s funny and it isn’t. Several of the nine women interviewed here have contemplated suicide. Two of them will die by their own hands Frances is already gone before this book even sees publication and Ann at 37, less than a decade later. Married at 16 herself, Kathy notes how “it’s every young girl’s wish to get married, isn’t it?” Dunn asks her what her biggest mistake has been. “Getting married at 16.”The interview with Pauline ranges across many subjects: creative inspiration, childhood, pressures, drugs, depressions, self-worth, self-definition, but its\u0026nbspreal subject is utterance. A section that begins “I\u0026nbspfelt guilty about having an ugly cunt” goes on to become a description of when she “was very little surrounded by my brothers and everything, who kept yelling ‘Shut up, you’re only a girl,’” then ends in\u0026nbspthoughts about being expected to be  made to be choosing to be a dumb blonde.The multiple meaning of a word like dumb isn’t lost in a book about talking. The interview is scattered with violence and the repeated casual use of the words “kill” and “scream”. Edna too uses the word when Dunn asks her about “being a writer and having children” and Edna talks about half the time “being a mother”, and the other half wanting “not to know that they’re alive”, because “being a writer is being a writer constantly”. This split self, she says, “that’s why women’s books and\u0026nbspwriting, modern women read as screams”.So Talking to Women is also one of the first books to\u0026nbspaddress the complications of the female self fragmented by prescribed notions of what women’s creativity should or shouldn’t be. “That’s what’s so marvellous, that’s why the feeling is so terribly good, the feeling of creating,” Dunn says to Suna (Portman). “Because you’re using every inch of yourself ... to\u0026nbspme\u0026nbspit’s the only time I’m really alive, creating.”In the final interview with Paddy (Kitchen) Dunn says: “I find that one’s constantly feeling what is one doing shutting oneself up in rooms writing books when there are plenty of books. Shouldn’t one be out fighting for freedom?” But it’s freedom that’s at stake, in this slim book of interviews. Emma tells Dunn: “I\u0026nbspdo wish that I hadn’t been such a pioneer. I wish I’d been a little later ... My mother was a social outcast because of me.” What do you get most out of doing now? Dunn asks her. “Talking, I suppose,” she says. Talking is, for Dunn, a politics of the personal, the social, the communal. In this way, it’s a place to live• A new edition of Talking to Women by Nell Dunn is published by Silver.

Nomad Foods, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is buying Aunt Bessie’s from William Jackson Food Group, a 167-year-old family firm based in Yorkshire. The deal includes a factory in Hull and will bring together Aunt Bessie’s – the UK’s number one brand for frozen Yorkshire puddings – with Nomad’s other investments, which include Findus, Birds Eye and Goodfellas Pizzas.Aunt Bessie’s – which last year made £20m profit from revenues of £108m – employs 400 people, all based in Hull. Nomad said all staff would transfer to Birds Eye when the deal is completed in the autumn, taking the group’s total workforce to 1,600. Nomad was set up three years ago by billionaire Noam Gottesman, the co-founder of the GLG hedge fund, and British-born financier Martin E. Franklin, as an investment vehicle in London. It later switched its listing to New York.William Jackson is a sixth generation family firm based in Hessle, near Hull, which also owns the organic vegetable box business Abel \u0026amp Cole, Jackson’s Yorkshire Champion Bread brands, a local pub and The Food Doctor healthy snacks. Wayne Hudson, the Birds Eye’s managing director, said. “Aunt Bessie’s is an incredibly well-known brand. This is a growth story – we have no intentions to close the plant and are integrating it into the Nomad Birds Eye business.”The deal comes just a few weeks after Nomad bought Goodfella’s, the UK’s biggest frozen pizza brand, for £200m from food tycoon Ranjit Boparan. It will help the food company strengthen its position in the UK, which it described as a “strategically important market”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1714016498ad45ff9080e68cdc3c767dfc9f6ea4/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1568a2bb976dc85e4a298ba162b218c3","title":"monsanto to ditch its infamous name after sale to bayer","story":"Activists say deal is ‘marriage made in hell’, creating world’s most powerful agribusinessThe Monsanto company name, which has become synonymous with genetically modified food and as a longstanding target of environmental activists, will disappear after the completion of its $63bn (£47bn) sale to the German company Bayer on Thursday.Bayer, a pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant, said on Monday it would immediately retire the 117-year-old Monsanto brand name. “Bayer will remain the company name. Monsanto will no longer be a company name,” it said in a statement. “The acquired products will retain their brand names and become part of the Bayer portfolio.”Monsanto has long been targeted by environmental activists for its pioneering role in creating GM crops and the deadly herbicide Agent Orange, used by the US in the Vietnam war. The company, which was founded in St Louis, Missouri, in 1901, has been described as an “example of American corporate evil”. Bayer’s chairman, Werner Baumann, promised the company would engage with campaigners, who have described the takeover as a “marriage made in hell”. There is no legal definition in the UK of a mega farm, but in the US concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are defined as those housing 125,000 broiler chickens, 82,000 laying hens, 2,500 pigs or 700 dairy or 1,000 beef cattle. These are the biggest of the intensive farms, which in the UK need permits if they house more than 40,000 chickens, 2,000 pigs or 750 breeding sows. There are now 789 mega farms in the UK, and the number of intensive farms has risen by more than a quarter in six years, from 1,332 in 2011 to 1,674 last year.Mega farms and intensive farms are controversial because they require keeping tens of thousands of animals in a small space, which campaigners and independent experts say can hamper their ability to express natural behaviours, such as nesting. The animals are often kept indoors throughout their lives, though on some farms they are allowed access to outdoor areas at least part of the time. There are also concerns that animals on mega farms may be over-medicated, as if one gets sick the whole herd is generally required to be treated.Mega farms and intensive farms take up much less space than traditional farms, and they allow animals to be kept securely, away from predators and potential carriers of disease, such as badgers. Their conditions are tightly controlled, allowing farmers to monitor the amount of daylight, water and feed for the animals, and if disease develops the livestock can be treated quickly. They are much cheaper to run than traditional farms.“We aim to deepen our dialogue with society. We will listen to our critics and work together where we find common ground,” Baumann said. “Agriculture is too important to allow ideological differences to bring progress to a standstill. We have to talk to each other. We need to listen to each other. It’s the only way to build bridges.” Adrian Bebb, a food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said Bayer’s decision to ditch the Monsanto name would not alter the company’s legacy.“Bayer will become Monsanto in all but name unless it takes drastic measures to distance itself from the US chemical giant’s controversial past,” he said. “If it continues to peddle dangerous pesticides and unwanted GMOs then it will quickly find itself dealing with the same global resistance that Monsanto did.”Friends of the Earth has run a long campaign to try to prevent the takeover, which it warned would “increase control over farmers and cut out competitors, and allow it to become the dominant ‘Facebook of farming’.” In May, dozens of people demonstrated against the takeover outside Bayer’s AGM in Bonn. “This merger will create the world’s biggest and most powerful agribusiness corporation, which will try to force its genetically modified seeds and toxic pesticides into our food and countryside,” Bebb said. “The coming together of these two is a marriage made in hell – bad for farmers, bad for consumers and bad for our countryside.”Bayer won approval for the takeover from US and European regulators after agreeing to sell $9bn worth of assets to reduce the combined companies’ dominance of the global seeds market.“The acquisition of Monsanto is a strategic milestone in strengthening our portfolio of leading businesses in health and nutrition,” Baumann said. “We will double the size of our agriculture business and create a leading innovation engine in agriculture, positioning us to better serve our customers and unlock the long-term growth potential in the sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9b3704d3d552a1e42dc0bab7c4481af7f02d0d6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a5cf5da73c4d414c882b931c9bcfc01","title":"britain society inequality trade brexit is not the way","story":"The Brexiters are right about many problems but wrong on the solution. Poverty, inequality, low wages and job insecurity – all can be addressed without leaving the EUBrexit Britain is right. The status quo is insupportable. But the solution is not to leave the European Union. Our problems are made in Britain they can only be solved in Britain. Europe does not impede this mission rather it is indispensable. The imperative is to transform the way our country works.The poverty, inequalities and hopelessness that propelled the Brexit vote – seven out of the 10 poorest areas in northern Europe are in England, and all voted for Brexit – must be decisively addressed. Britain must simultaneously recommit to full EU membership as its benefits and the colossal costs of exit become ever clearer, and stand solidly with Europe as dark and menacing forces stalk the globe – not least an imminent transatlantic trade war and the wider threats of Donald Trump.To chase the economic moonbeams peddled by Brexiters while the values we prize are under global assault, to cower behind borders that shut out the rest of our continent, and to seek to resurrect an unachievable island sovereignty: this is a dead end that can only result in widespread suffering. That could even begin the day after Brexit next year, with widespread shortages of medicines, fuel and food as the port of Dover collapses with no Brexit deal – according to Whitehall departments’ risk assessments leaked and paraded in the Sunday Times yesterday.Brexiters dodge these truths. Intent on completing the Thatcher revolution, they want us out of the EU at any cost. While feigning concern for the state of Britain, their real agenda is wholly to embed a Thatcherite world of self-organising free markets and minimal social provision that will bring unalloyed benefit – whatever the baleful track record. They want out of Europe because it stands in their way.But two years after the referendum, the Brexiters’ “have your cake and eat it” fantasies have evaporated. There is no Brexit idend, rather the prospect of dismal economic growth and tax rises. The extra £350m a week supposedly available for the NHS turns out not to exist and instead we have an exit bill of £39bn (and rising). Then there is the up to £20bn a year cost of observing customs obligations after Brexit – an avalanche of self-imposed red tape – along with as much or more again as UK organisations expensively relocate to the European mainland.Virtually no one still claims, as they did during the referendum campaign, that we can retain the economic benefits of EU membership while leaving the European customs union and the single market. The prospect of “quick and simple” trade deals outside the EU is now recognised as delusory, particularly with Trump’s protectionist US and Xi Jinping’s China. It is the “global” EU that already has the trade deals, either done or in the making, with at least 60 countries, including Canada, Japan and South Korea – which are all in jeopardy for the UK on Brexit day. The EU is the citadel of rules-based international free trade and the international standard-setter that Britain did so much to create – and at whose centre we stood. “Global Britain” is a chimera.The economic warnings are there for those prepared to see them. Inward investment has collapsed by some £130bn over the last 12 months. The car industry fears “Carmageddon”. There is no open-skies deal with the US. Being frozen out of the Galileo project endangers our space industry. Universities fear being cut out of EU research budgets. It is the same in sector after sector.Europe’s achievements have not been driven solely by an economic calculus: they belonged to a bigger, nobler cause of representing European values, rooted in democracy. This is why any form of Brexit is a mistake. We want to share a continent where Europeans don’t fight each other, don’t prevent trade and where we allow its people to live and work wherever they like across their region. Never has Europe been so peaceful, democratic and prosperous as in the era of the EU.Saving Britain is a twin-pronged task: transforming our economy and society so they work for all while recommitting to an EU that covers our backs better than we know. Today’s laissez-faire, sink-or-swim approach to economics and society has to end instead our hijacked capitalism must be populated with repurposed businesses, motivated by a desire to produce goods and services that better humanity. New technology needs to be mobilised for the public good, while great institutions that serve the mass of people – such as trade unions, public-benefit companies to run utilities and building societies – must be reinvigorated and reshaped.A refashioned social contract should invest public money where desperately needed and raise the necessary taxes fairly. The centrepiece should be an educational Marshall plan. Part of this contract should be a stronger notion of citizenship, including a national identity card system to assure citizens that we know exactly who is here and what they are entitled to.A Great Charter for Modern Britain would hand power from Westminster to the cities, towns and counties of Britain so as to transform their localities, represented in a senate to replace the House of Lords, located in the north of England. This should be the foundation of a fully fledged written constitution.It is the Labour party – firmly pro-European and credible in its commitment to social reform – that could rally the country. The present policy of colluding in Brexit, while trying to make sure it is a Tory-authored disaster, will impose unnecessary suffering on too many. The great power of democracy is that citizens can change their minds as facts change: the Brexit refusal to countenance a second vote on grounds of its isiveness is born of fear that the people will reassess their decision. The worse isiveness is to press on regardless.Great countries find the political resource to turn around epic mistakes. The Labour party has the chance to save Britain, stand by Europe at a critical juncture in world affairs and form a great reforming government.

Get the best of ‘Canada’s downtown’ with a two-day itinerary from local writer Jim ByersMorningStart with a tour of the city’s most historic district, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood. Local historianman-about-town Bruce Bell will show you interesting views of the St. Lawrence Market (proclaimed best in the world by National Geographic) – and the historic town jail. The market is filled with everything from water buffalo sliders to smoked teriyaki salmon and fresh raspberries as deep and red as the Maple Leaf flag.Stop in the market for a class Canadian lunch: a peameal bacon sandwich at Carousel Bakery. For about £4 (C$7), you’ll get thick, juicy slices of bacon that are really more like cured ham. Other options at the market include tasty veal or chicken sandwiches drenched in tomato sauce (and sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms) at Uno Mustachio. Want something more formal? The highly rated Biagio is nearby.AfternoonFrom the market, head east on the Queen streetcar to The Beaches neighbourhood. Toronto has a series of fine beaches along Lake Ontario, with boardwalks and bike trails that march for miles alongside shady parks. There’s decent swimming in summer, as well as stand-up paddle boarding and beach volleyball played by athletic, youthful locals. If that’s your thing.EveningStop in at the Distillery District for a local lager or ale at Mill Street Brew Pub. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas with great views of the restored industrial sheen of this historic district, once part of the Gooderham and Worts distilling empire. If you’re not a drinker, settle in for a fabulous coffee at Balzac’s (open ’til 8pm) – grab a spot on the second-floor balcony for great views of the crowds below. Shops in the area include Corktown Designs (nice jewellery) and John Fluevog for shoes, and there are several cool galleries. For food, El Catrin restaurant has a terrific patio or the super-colourful mural indoors is an equally impressive backdrop. Try the guacamole, which they make at your table, or the pork tacos.MorningTry breakfast at Over Easy, a nice cafe with just the right ambience on Yonge Street. If you want something lighter (and with fancier coffee), head instead to Dineen, just a few blocks north.To really appreciate Toronto, you need to visit one of the city parks when the weather is nice. People from all over the world congregate at open barbecues and play games or loll in the shade as the smoke from their lunch rises higher in the air. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a trendy spot in the West End, while Riverdale Park has a free farm kids will love. A trip to the Toronto Islands also allows you the park experience plus a short ferry ride (but come early to avoid crowds). Alternatively, check out quiet waterways by canoe, or admire the refurbished homes on Ward’s Island. There’s a legal nude beach at Hanlan’s Point too, near where former baseball legend Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run.AfternoonSome visitors hit the heights at the CN Tower (the highest observation area is 447 meters high) when they first get here. I think it’s best to enjoy the view after you’ve seen a bit and know what you’re looking at. You can try the Edge Walk and suspend yourself from the roof via a cable if you like, or just enjoy the scenery from inside like a normal person.Kensington Market is one of the city’s other iconic sights. It’s been an area dominated by Jewish, Portuguese and Chinese immigrants (and others) over the years. Nowadays it’s a mixture of all of the above, along with hipster joints, Caribbean spots and CentralSouth American shops and restaurants. They close the streets to traffic on Sundays and the area becomes a parade of people from around the globe. Stop at Rasta Pasta for great jerk chicken and rice (C$5 for a sizeable portion), or try Amadeu’s for a taste of Portugal.EveningA drink on the Ritz-Carlton terrace is in order. It’s in a quiet spot backing on to a small park, and they have some lovely Cuban-style drinks on the menu. Not far away is the Wheat Sheaf, billed as Toronto’s oldest tavern. And up on Dundas Street West, Rhum Corner has exceptional rum drinks and a Caribbean-meets-the-big-city feel.Finish up with dinner on Ossington Avenue, the city’s “hippest” street. Boralia makes meals based on recipes from Canada that date back as far as 1605, including mussels cooked over smoking pine needles (allegedly a recipe that explorer Samuel Champlain used in 1605). Grab a gourmet ice cream sandwich at Bang Bang Ice Cream to finish your night.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9782b4c2e169ab67c091ca14a0315538c2b5ea0f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb344b738bfdeb0a74dd95b3f74ff8","title":"a fashion lovers guide to canada","story":"Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …What I knew about Canada before I embarked on my one-week, three-city trip this summer was limited to a handful of sources: 90s TV show North of 60, Drake songs (which can arguably be seen as a Toronto guidebook written by its most famous resident), and the work of iconic brands such as Roots and Herschel.What I didn’t know was that by the time I left, I’d have discovered one of the most talented crops of local makers and designers anywhere in the world, eaten the best tacos of my life, and experienced a view – on the summit of Vancouver’s Howe Sound – that made me feel insignificant in the best possible way. And that’s to say nothing of the incredible people I met – and the raw energy of the country’s erse, accepting and multicultural cities. Canada really is a place without barriers – somewhere no one could feel like an outsider.I arrived in Toronto with high expectations and I can honestly say that they were surpassed. World-class boutiques, killer vintage finds and an unmistakable big town buzz. This is a city that has its pulse on contemporary fashion.Ice cream and being seen on Queen Street WestQueen Street West is Toronto’s creative and fashion hub – and somewhere that’s been on my radar since Vogue crowned it one of the world’s top three hippest neighbourhoods in 2014. It’s easy to see why. Not only is it home to high-end destination boutiques, such as Nomad, but it’s also a platform for Toronto’s homegrown talent – there are a lot of independent boutiques supporting each other in this prime location.I discovered local makers such as YNOT and Kotn, who are representing everything that’s great about contemporary Toronto as a city and Canada as a country with their designs. YNOT’s sturdy, stylish rucksacks and hardwearing jackets call to mind how connected to nature you are in Canada – even in the middle of its biggest city – while Kotn’s clean and elegant basics represent luxury in its simplest form.If you’re looking to mix local selections with high-end international pieces, head to Nomad – the boutique stocks an excellent range of powerhouse names such as Comme des Garçons and Raf Simons. My top Queen Street West tip? Take a long stroll, heading west to east, with an ice cream in hand from iHalo Krunch.Vintage finds in Kensington MarketIf you love vintage, there’s nowhere better than Kensington Market. This hip, colourful neighbourhood near downtown Toronto has a plethora of stores packed with wonderful finds. It has an amazing sense of street life too: turn any corner and you’ll find bars with small outdoor performance spaces, full of drinkers enjoying a show in the sun, or – as I did – dining at truly quirky restaurants, such as Rasta Pasta, the home of Jamaican-Italian fusion.Seeing where the magic happens at the Roots factoryRoots is probably the quintessential Canadian brand. Again, the strong connection to nature comes through in what it produces. Roots has been part of pop culture for years, yet still manages to feel current – proved by its recent collaboration with Drake. The rapper had a range of varsity jackets for his OVO label co-produced with the brand.I had the chance to visit the factory, which was fascinating from my perspective as a tailor and designer, to get an insight into its production processes. One thing is for sure: they really know their leather. It was also great to understand who makes it and why. Walking into the factory, you see flags everywhere, representing all of the different nations Roots’ employees come from. It really reflects Canada’s multicultural vibe – people bring their own roots to Roots.Cool Canadiana at Drake General StoreJust across the street from the Drake Hotel on Queen West, Drake General Store is like a souvenir shop for people who wouldn’t normally buy souvenirs. It’s a stylish space full of considered Canadiana, where all of the products have a curated feel – from the beautiful Alberta-made blanket I picked up, to the artisan maple syrup I brought for my friend who runs a cafe back home in south London. If you’re only visiting Toronto but want to get a sense of the whole of Canada, it’s the place to go.New architecture and timeless art at the Art Gallery of OntarioI was really excited to see the recent Frank Gehry extension of the Art Gallery of Ontario it’s a stunning addition to an already stunning building. Inside, I got to see some of the fantastic work by the Group of Seven – a group of Canadian landscape painters who initiated Canada’s first major national art movement.Fring’s by name, fring by natureNamed and frequented by Drake, Fring’s delivers a unique fusion of Asian and soul food under the stewardship of Canadian celebrity chef Susur Lee. Fring’s derives its name from Canadian-Caribbean patois, translating roughly to “good times remembered” – and after one meal here I’ve got no reservations in saying that the moniker fits. It’s an intimate space with a first-rate interior fit out, and the Hong Kong chicken and waffles with maple chili glaze were unforgettable.If only I’d had more than two days in Montreal. It’s a city unlike any other – a perfect blend of European charm and North American hustle. It’s also a place for those who love the finer things in life: amazing food, slick bars and very stylish people.Mont RoyalThe size and scale of the green spaces in Canada’s cities is something that I still struggle to get my head around – Montreal’s Mont Royal, also known as Mount Royal, is no exception. The vista over the city from the highest point of the park takes in all of downtown Montreal, while the walking route back downhill towards Saint-Laurent offers a great view of the nine-storey Leonard Cohen mural keeping watch over his old borough.Sheer ‘jeanius’ at Naked \u0026amp Famous DenimBrandon Svarc is a denim genius. Producing jeans under his Naked \u0026amp Famous moniker, he’s a maker who knows his product so well that he can stretch it to its limits – whether its dyeing jeans in green tea or red wine, or producing the heaviest pair of jeans in the world out of 32oz Japanese selvedge denim. The Naked \u0026amp Famous factory is right on top of the store. The denim gets made on the third floor and is sold downstairs in the Tate \u0026amp Yoko boutique.My idea of heaven at Maison CloakroomI wasn’t expecting this: a premium men’s tailoring retailer with its own speakeasy. In other words, something like my idea of heaven. Maison Cloakroom is housed in a beautiful 19th-century townhouse on Rue de la Montagne in downtown Montreal. This place sums up that distinctive Montreal feel – old and new, European and American – more than anywhere else in the city.Meeting the makers at Lowell MTLLowell MTL may take its name from the region of Massachusetts that was once home to a large population of French Canadians (Jack Kerouac the most famous of them), but it is a Montreal brand to the core – all of its products take inspiration from locations in and around the city. Mathieu Mudie and Rachel Fortin, the husband and wife team behind Lowell MTL, made the brand’s name producing premium leather accessories, but they have since expanded into stylish men’s and women’s clothing ranges.The ultimate Reuben at Dunn’s FamousYou can’t leave Montreal without trying a classic smoked meat sandwich from one of the city’s famous delis. As with any local specialty, there’s always hot debate about who does the best, but it’s hard to imagine anywhere outdoing the full-fat, classic Reuben at Dunn’s Famous – a sandwich piled impossibly high with Dunn’s famous smoked brisket, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island sauce.Returning the favour at LovSometimes you just stumble upon one of the best places in town. That’s what happened with Lov. We found this place after taking a wrong turn en route to another restaurant. But it only took one look at what was coming out of the kitchen to convince us to stay – smart, innovative vegetarian dishes just asking to be washed down with one of Lov’s signature botanical cocktails. So good we returned the following night.By now I should have been used to just how close to nature you are in any Canadian city, but Vancouver takes it up a notch: from downtown you can be right on the water in 15 minutes walk. It’s something you can feel with the relaxed, west coast attitude of the people, and something that really comes through in the work of local makers Herschel and Dayton Boots, who have put Vancouver on the world style map.Colour and craftsmanship at the Museum of AnthropologySet deep in the leafy campus of the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology is home to a vast collection of indigenous artworks and cultural artefacts. I was lucky enough to have met Haida designer and artist Dorothy Grant at her home and studio before my visit – she gave me a real understanding of the varying colours and shapes used by different tribes. Seeing the level of craftsmanship on the totems, masks, garments and weaves on display up close was an experience I will never forget.Revolutionary fabrics at HerschelIt’s great to see such a young brand doing what it does so confidently. Herschel bags have made their mark so strongly as a street style staple since 2009 that, for me, they’ve become virtually synonymous with the idea of a rucksack. As a tailor, it was fascinating to see the work that the brand is doing in producing its own materials, such as the ApexKnit: a groundbreaking new fabric from which its makers are able to produce a single-piece rucksack.A fine legacy at Dayton BootsDayton Boots represents so much of what is great about Vancouver’s makers and the city’s style ethos. The brand started out more than 70 years ago, making boots for loggers. Today, their product is still as sturdy and well-crafted as it was then – but like so many great workwear brands, what they produce works just as well as a contemporary look. I’d recommend taking a look for yourself – the Dayton Boots factory is open to the public and right behind their flagship store on East Hastings Street.Record shopping and more in GastownGastown is home to one of the best record shops in the city – Beat Street Records, just around the corner from Gastown’s famous Steam clock.I’m a lover of jazz, funk and hip-hop and was blown away by the selections: among them releases by J-Dilla and Slum Village that I’d never come across in London, and hard-to-come-by rarities by Thelonious Monk and a load of other jazz greats. Of course, record shops aren’t the only thing you’ll find in Gastown. It’s a neighbourhood that has long been considered the spot for fine eating and drinking in Vancouver. Try Bao Down for some of Vancouver’s best Asian fusion street food.No more tacos after TacofinoAnd then there was Tacofino. What can I say about this place, other than is sells simply the finest tacos I’ve ever eaten. They were so good that I haven’t been able to find anything close since returning to London – it just feels like we’re not doing it right. But it’s not just the tacos – Tacofino also distinguishes itself with west coast-inspired ceviche, tostadas and nachos, as well as the phenomenal chilli salt wings with lime and valentina.The view to end all views, from the Sea to Sky GondolaIf you’re going to Vancouver, you have to take the Sea to Sky Gondola. It takes you over some of the most incredible natural scenery I saw in Canada, and it’s all less than an hour’s drive away from the city centre. The view from the summit was awe-inspiring, and many of the hiking trails coursing up the ascent were easily walkable for a beginner like me. It’s one of those places that makes you and your problems feel small – and all the better for it.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canadaPhotography: Momme Halbe and Taryn Paterson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39912a7cdf7d8433c317d692610f71872e8c41b0/0_122_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6af73197e24cc904904b480750bd79","title":"everton marco silva big names rooney door open","story":"Everton’s new manager, Marco Silva, hopes to deliver a team to excite their supporters.Silva, who replaces Sam Allardyce as manager at Goodison Park, was unveiled to the media at the Premier League club’s Finch Farm training ground.The former Hull and Watford manager said: “It is easy to understand the culture and identity.

We have good players on the wing in Thomas Müller and Marco Reus. Julian Draxler played a good Confed Cup and made progress there.“It was a tight race between Leroy Sané and Julian Brandt. Both have big qualities, both are good in the one-on-one duels. Julian Brandt was at the Confed Cup, had some strong games there, and put in good shifts in the training camp too. Leroy Sané is a huge talent, no doubt, and he will be back with the team in September.”Sané has so far won 12 caps for Germany but he has yet to find the back of the net for his national team. He has also only set up one goal. “Maybe he has not fully arrived in the national team games. Maybe that tipped the balance,” Löw said. “He did a good job against Austria, tried to work in defence, went into the transition play. No blame here. And his behaviour off the pitch was good as well.”There were places for Sané’s City team-mate Ilkay Gündogan, Arsenal’s Mesut Özil and Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger, as well as the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who has been appointed team captain despite his long recovery from injury.

For many, this summer will be all about skips, cement and the builder’s drill. For those planning home improvements, the key question will\u0026nbspbe where they can find a reliable tradesperson.Some 45,000 people called Citizens Advice last year seeking help with their home improvement and maintenance problems, and the Federation of Master Builders estimates cowboy contractors cost the UK economy £10bn a year.So which of the websites that vet traders should consumers turn to?On this commercial site, traders pay to quote for jobs posted by customers, who can then leave feedback about them. The identities and qualifications of traders who apply to join are verified, and data analysis tools are used to check they have not been banned in the past and that the reviews are by genuine customers.Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services. Traders have the right to reply, and a decision about whether to suspend their membership is made within 72 hours. “We get threatened with legal action all the time by traders, but we don’t bow into pressure to remove bad reviews,” says Peter Wellock, head of customer service.Another commercial site where traders pay to quote for jobs and the qualifications of those who apply to join are verified. Rated People speaks to every trader by phone or in person before they apply. One out of every four are blocked by its screening process, which includes fraud and credit checks. Those accepted typically pay £55 plus VAT per month on average, which allows them to quote for a limited number of jobs. Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services.Between five and 15 of the 90,000 jobs posted per month end in a dispute, says chief executive Celia Francis. “Often, the tradesperson will fix the problem and the customer will take the review down.” Sometimes, customer services will refer both parties to a mediation service, which costs each of them £25. The ultimate sanction is removal of membership.A commercial directory of 29,000 vetted traders who pay a minimum of £70 plus VAT per month to be listed. They have to pass a face-to-face interview and provide a minimum of five references. Qualifications and public liability insurance are examined, and background and identity checks carried out. All traders must agree to a code of conduct and allow Checkatrade to talk to Trading Standards about their work.Customers can review work online or via a Freepost postcard. Negative feedback is published within five days as long as reviewers give Checkatrade permission to contact the trader about the complaint. The tradesperson will then be allowed a right to reply and encouraged to put things right. The website may also decide to remove the trader from its directory.This is a non-profit, government-endorsed scheme intended to raise standards among tradespeople. Registered firms that are members of 32 recognised trade bodies and scheme operators, which have been vetted by TrustMark, can pay £40 a year to display its logo and be listed on the website. Currently, around 12,500 businesses are on the site.Traders have to sign up to a code of conduct and undergo background checks on their identity and business. They will also receive an on-site inspection at their place of business and at a site where they have carried out work.Work quality is checked by an expert, so users do not need to rely on reviews from other customers, says chief executive Simon Ayers. Those with complaints will be able to take up their issue with the trader and their scheme operator.An independent, not-for-profit directory of 3,550 vetted traders, run by Trading Standards and supported by 56 local authorities. Only those who have been trading for at least six months may pay £125 plus VAT to apply to be listed. A Trading Standards officer will then audit the business. Background and financial checks are done to look for criminal convictions. Previous customers are randomly selected for\u0026nbspreferences, although the work is not inspected.The website has access to a Trading Standards database and can check traders aren’t generating complaints to Citizens Advice, says the directory’s operations manager, Rachael Holden.Any claims traders make about their business or qualifications are verified. Only traders who pass this audit and have a complaints procedure can join.Which site works best? All five were tested with a search to “refresh my garden” in Cambridge so that costs could be\u0026nbspcompared.No one on MyBuilder wanted to quote and only one Rated People gardener, who was not affiliated to any scheme and did not list any qualifications on his website, offered a quote but wanted to visit the garden.When called, he said he charged £180 a day for labour and was available to start in two weeks. When the job was not offered to him, he called back two hours later to stress he had\u0026nbsp“bought” the job from Rated People. He had 15 five-star ratings out of 15 possible reviews.The Checkatrade directory gave details of two firms within five miles that had been given feedback in the past month. Both had more than 50 reviews and scores of 9.8 and 9.9 out of 10. The first refused to give a quote without visiting the garden, but promised a gardener would then be available to do the work within two weeks. The second quoted £350 per day for two people’s labour, but was booked up until\u0026nbspSeptember.On TrustMark, a trader who was a member of the Association of Professional Landscapers, the Horticultural Trades Association and Buy With Confidence quoted £320 to £350 per day for two people’s labour over the phone, but said he was booked up until early next year.The closest Buy With Confidence landscape gardener, who was a member of the Gardeners Guild and the Countryside Management Association, and a Green Flag Awards judge, said he was too busy to take on any work until next year.Visiting all five directories, reading the reviews, checking out inidual websites and qualifications, and making phone calls took well over an hour but achieved little. In the end, it was a relief that a landscape gardener was not needed after all. The ideal trader would have been both a member of TrustMark and Buy With Confidence whose work had been inspected by an expert in their field, as well as being a business approved by a Trading Standards officer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d942cb31b802dc4ec5d435d1bd00722cf6a7350/292_620_2201_1320/master/2201.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b2a517d9cf93fc0e91798b3f70a7c83","title":"how we made funkadelic one nation under a groove","story":"‘A woman came up on stage butt-naked and started blowing smoke rings out of her private parts’We’d played a gig in Washington DC and afterwards two young girls, LaTanya and Darlene, came up to the car and told us it was was the best concert they’d ever seen. They said: “It was like one nation under a groove.” As soon as I heard that, I knew it had to become a song.Initially, all I had was a hook – “One nation under a groove, gettin’ down just for the funk of it.” In the studio, once we got a rhythm together, I pretty much ad-libbed the rest. I wanted the silky feel of the Dionne Warwick records with Burt Bacharach – a smooth groove, but funky.The line “So high you can’t get over it, so low you can’t get under it” was used by the Temptations in Psychedelic Shack, but it actually goes back much earlier, to gospel. I also took a catchphrase used by the Mantan Moreland chauffeur character in the Charlie Chan movies, when he was ready to run from the ghost: “Feet, don’t fail me now!” And the line “Dance your way out of your constrictions” is about people’s hangups: you can deal with them by being grumpy or with a smile.At the time, I had three bands – Parliament, Funkadelic and Bootsy’s Rubber Band – that were all basically the same people. That gave us a better chance of survival. One Nation could have been a Parliament record, but Funkadelic needed a hit. The guitar solo made it more Funkadelic.I credited Darlene and Tanya on the One Nation Under a Groove album cover. For me, the song was about bringing humanity together, because the real problems are gonna come when we’re dealing with other planets and we have to worry about aliens coming to eat us or fuck us with five dicks.The freedom extended to the music. We were mixing funk, rock, soul and psychedelia. One Nation Under a Groove was already well under way by the time I was called in to overdub my parts. The studio was like a party. George was behind the console and would give me the melody and I could play whatever I felt. I had one of the first guitar synthesisers, and was trying to get it to harmonise with my guitar. I hadn’t really mastered it, so kept the solo simple.I always took One Nation Under a Groove to mean that some of the world’s problems are too big to change, so we might as well just groove. We’d play it until we felt like stopping – it could last half an hour. One night, as the spaceship started taking off, the drum kit got tangled up, so went up in the air with it. Another night, a woman got on stage butt-naked and was blowing smoke rings out of her private parts. I was a young kid, five feet away with my guitar, thinking, “How do I follow that?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73954129ec1fd7c52bbe3ac25a08e4338a17961d/0_183_3772_2263/master/3772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72a70485d2a866c8f16cb3b99d8a7e5c","title":"can you solve it world cup arithmetic","story":"The puzzle that shoots and scoresThe World Cup is almost upon us, so here’s a puzzle to get you in the mood.England, Tunisia, Belgium and Panama make up Group G.

A version of this puzzle appeared in his column in the Strand Magazine in 1921.A twist on Dudeney’s idea has the table include blanks, as if your coffee spilt on the sports pages and obscured some of the numbers. Here’s one that GCHQ tweeted during Euro 2016:Again, here you need to work out every result in the group. But to do that you need also to deduce the blanks in the table. It’s quite tricky. If you want a tip to get you going, I’ve included one in the first comment below the line.The GCHQ soccer-doku led me to ponder whether or not one can design a football table puzzle in which only a single number is given (in other words all the numbers apart from one of them have been obscured) and from which we can deduce every single result between the teams.

Likewise, occasionally, a player’s career can be defined by the tournaments they do not win rather than those they do just ask Jean van de Velde.Ariya Jutanugarn already had a major championship success when she stepped onto the 10th tee at the US Women’s Open on Sunday seven strokes ahead of the field. Still, a subsequent capitulation threatened to portray the 22-year-old as the leading character in one of golf’s most epic tales of woe. That Jutanugarn steadied herself to emerge victorious from a sudden death play-off with Kim Hyo-joo points towards formidable mental strength.“After you have a seven-shot lead and end up that you have to go to play-off, you have no expectations,” the champion admitted. “I kind of got mad. But I thought: ‘Ok, if I have a play-off I’m going to make sure I do my best every shot because I feel like I didn’t commit over that back nine.’ I felt like I had last chance to make myself proud.”There is an admirable, broader ambition. “I want to inspire all the kids in Thailand,” said Jutanugarn. This marks a significant step she is the first Thai player to win the US Open.Pre-tournament fears that a sodden Shoal Creek may deliver a substandard major proved misguided. It was just a pity, in fact, that such thin galleries witnessed Sunday’s drama unfold. Jutanugarn, already a nine-time winner on the LPGA Tour and the 2016 British Open champion, appeared under no pressure whatsoever when beginning her final nine holes. Her 16 under par total matched the 72-hole tournament record with a gettable stretch still to come.A blocked three-wood from the 10th triggered a triple bogey, with Kim’s birdie run in the group ahead even more pertinent when Jutanugarn dropped another shot at the 12th. With Jutanugarn looking on from the fairway, Kim holed out brilliantly from 50ft and off the 15th green. Back-to-back bogeys to close from the Thai, for an 11 under par aggregate, conceded the two-stroke lead restored at the 16th and meant the play-off which all onlookers, in reality, expected her to lose. Instead, Jutanugarn prevailed at the fourth extra hole.She cited victory in her last two play-offs as cause for confidence. Still, there was candid reflection of events from the 10th after which she was “scared” to hit tee shots. Enter Jutanugarn’s caddie, Les Luark. “I go to tee off on 11 and I told my caddie, ‘I don’t know how to hit this one,’” Jutanugarn said. “He’s like, ‘Come on, do you want to win?’ I’m like, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Okay. Then we have to do it.“Even in my playoff I said to my caddie, ‘Should I try to hit three-wood?’ He’s like, ‘If you ask me this question you shouldn’t try. Keep hitting two-iron.’”This Sunday rather epitomised the peaks and troughs that Jutanugarn has sampled in a relatively short career. She led the ANA Inspiration of 2016 by two with three to play and slipped to an unwanted treble of bogeys. Later that year she won her first major, the British Open. Last year, though, having reached top spot in the world rankings she duly missed four successive major cuts. Jutanugarn’s sister, Moriya, is also a professional player. “After she become world No1 last time she struggled,” explained the Jutanugarn Snr. “I think she was just young and she didn’t really handle it that well. I’m pretty sure next time she will do it better. She will learn a lot from last time.”Consistency in 2018 earned her $700,000 even before the $900,000 boost that comes with being crowned US Open champion.Kim had represented formidable opposition for Jutanugarn. Her 2014 major victory, at the ANA Inspiration, included an opening round of 61. The Korean had been a prolific winner in her homeland before taking seamlessly to the LPGA Tour.“It did not really enter my mind at the start of the day that I was going to come that close, so I just focused on playing my game,” said Kim. “I’m extremely happy that I was part of a kind of historical day. My scoring has been improving, especially it’s gotten better with the majors lately. So I’m happy about that. I’m also very happy that I did pretty good in this tournament.”Charley Hull’s best US Open to date saw her finish in a share of 10th. Michelle Wie was among those alongside the Englishwoman at even par."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b7003ab1b960fbc075d6230cfc9da82abd1e61f/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f96834a6910a1ed8b11d8914469935","title":"elon musk visionary space travel fell back down to earth","story":"The champion of clean energy and space travel, who was on a trajectory seemingly forever up, is now locked in battle with the same media which once feted himOnce upon a time Elon Musk was our era’s real-life Tony Stark, a billionaire Iron Man streaking across the sky with technology to save the planet and take us to Mars.Reusable rockets, electric cars, solar power, he did them all, taking time out to advise Robert Downey Jr on how to play the Marvel superhero on a trajectory seemingly forever up, up, up.Now Musk, 46, is literally and figuratively in a long, dark hole. He is tunneling beneath Los Angeles to create a prototype underground transit network which, he says, can save the city from traffic congestion. A noble goal. But a recently released video of the tunnel plus a map of potential lines coincided with a dark turn in Musk’s fortunes and reputation, creating the impression of a man in a labyrinth of his own making.His car company Tesla is hemorrhaging money and credibility. Unhappy shareholders want to dump three directors, including Musk’s brother Kimbal, from the board. Lawsuits tangle his clean energy company SolarCity.The entrepreneur has responded to negative headlines by lashing out at the news media and inidual journalists.“Holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them,” he tweeted last week, ire stoked by a damning report about Tesla factory safety. Musk followed up by calling journalists sanctimonious twisters of facts beholden to advertisers – and proposed a remedy. “Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article \u0026amp track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor \u0026amp publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda.”For some of his online supporters – he has 21.9 million Twitter followers – this was a call to arms. They piled on journalists with abuse and threats.For Musk skeptics it was further evidence of his burrowing into ethical murk. Instead of Iron Man here was Gollum, erratic and vengeful, scrabbling with trolls.“Going after the free press because they’ve been critical of your company is not how a CEO, visionary or even an adult reacts to criticism and it has real-world consequences,” Roberto Baldwin wrote in the technology blog network Engadget. Other outlets have weighed in, excoriating Musk as a thin-skinned bully who wouldn’t recognise journalistic independence if it rode a blazing meteorite over California. “The Donald Trump of Silicon Valley,” declared the New York Times.The bold champion of clean energy and space travel now locked in battle with the same media which once feted him as a visionary. How did it come to this? One possible answer: Tesla has skidded into trouble and Musk is blaming the messenger in apparent hope of soothing skittish investors and potential investors.A year ago Wall Street was toasting the company. Its market value surpassed that of Ford and General Motors thanks to sales of the battery-powered Model S sedan, a pioneering autopilot system and the promise that a $35,000 economy version of the Model 3 would soon roll off assembly lines, turning Tesla into a mass market auto-maker.Breaking into a market of gasoline-focused giants to make stylish, emissions-free cars adored by customers was a remarkable feat. Few others had dared, let alone succeeded. Musk’s public presentations inspired an evangelical vibe among cheering audiences. Then came setbacks. Tesla recalled 126,000 Model S cars to fix bolts. Crashes raised troubling questions about autopilot systems. “Production hell” – Musk’s words – plagued the Model 3. The long-promised economy version has yet to emerge, undermining Tesla’s claim to be a mass market player. The company reported record losses and burnt through $750m in cash in the last quarter. Its stock, credit rating and valuation plunged amid speculation about bankruptcy. Tesla will likely need a big cash infusion to survive. “More bad press for Elon: the car Elon Musk launched into orbit has fallen back down to Earth and crushed Malala Yousafzai,” blared a headline this week. This time it really was fake news – a satirical article from Clickhole, a spinoff from the Onion. “Hell of a week,” he tweeted. The Pakistani human rights advocate ran with the joke and tweeted that she was keeping the car. “Finders keepers,” he responded.It was a fleeting, lighthearted interlude in his toxic response to genuine bad news, a mix of scorn and conspiracy theory aimed at delegitimising reports of Tesla woes.“Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‘You’re just like Trump!’” he tweeted. “Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no one believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.“Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks \u0026amp earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies \u0026amp gasdiesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.”His followers have followed up with invective against inidual reporters, especially female ones, a misogynistic streak detailed in a Daily Beast article. “It is as though they’ve invested their own identity as males into Elon and his work,” said Shannon Stirone, a science writer.When not gaslighting online, Musk’s fans can unwind by using handheld flamethrowers: his tunnel company, Boring, sold 20,000 at $500 each. A good investment for the impending zombie apocalypse, said Musk.Amid the tide of criticism it is easy to overlook Musk’s achievements, and some nuance.The South Africa-born boy who designed and sold a video game, Blastar, by the age of 12, is self-made. He studied economics and physics and minted a fortune at PayPal before upending space exploration with audacious innovation.He sets impossible targets, for example in fuel efficiency, said one SpaceX engineer, on condition of anonymity. “We tell him it can’t be done, then spend months working around the clock and deliver maybe half the target, which is amazing, but we’re almost apologetic.”SpaceX set a new milestone in February by launching the Falcon Heavy, the first time a private company has sent such a powerful rocket into space, paving the way for even bigger rockets to potentially carry humans to Mars. “It’d be pretty cool to die on Mars, just not on impact,” Musk once joked to the . (His representatives declined an interview request for this article).Unlike most CEOs Musk engages with customers and journalists, albeit mostly via Twitter. He has told his more trollish supporters to cool it. “At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence \u0026amp abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all.”The media sometimes misses or chooses to miss his humour. Naming his putative journalism credibility rating site Pravda may not be hilarious but is hardly an attempt to recreate the Soviet propaganda mouthpiece. And yes, many journos are under pressure to get max clicks and earn advertising dollars.The reason Iron Man fell to earth, however, is that reality overtook the hype. He dazzled investors with an image of mass produced Teslas which so far remains a mirage. Maybe Musk can yet make it real – the jury is out.Blasting the media is a tantrum or smokescreen, perhaps both. Either way it is straight from the Trump playbook, though in this case the media are not lying, hypocritical liberal ideologues but lying, hypocritical shills for Tesla’s fossil fuel rivals.That narrative may play out underground too if the media keep reporting skepticism about Musk’s vision of a Los Angeles labyrinth, with some calling it a plutocrat’s fantasy, others a boondoggle.A recent public presentation hosted by Musk was tightly controlled – no TV cameras, entry by reservation, pre-approved questions – and packed with a cheering crowd. The last question: “Will you organize a big party before the tunnel launch?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31704a990a569fdc2a3402edd4bf0601f2e1f0d3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcefb8155885949ff44024ac5190e083","title":"father ted only fools and horses rise sitcom musical","story":"A number of comedy classics are being reinterpreted for the stage as ‘joke-box’ musicals. Can they avoid the pitfalls of previous sitcom adaptations? Commercially, this is logical. Almost all recent hit musicals have featured either a story familiar from elsewhere – a Roald Dahl book (Matilda) or a movie (Strictly Ballroom, School of Rock) – or already-recognisable songs from, say, Meatloaf (Bat Out of Hell: The Musical), or Carole King (Beautiful). But, with most of the Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley back catalogues now musicalised, new corners of popular culture needed to be mined. The adaptations of Father Ted, Only Fools and Horses and Goodnight Sweetheart suggest a new theatrical trend – the joke-box musical. One promising aspect of the projects is the talent involved. The Father Ted show is written by its TV creators, Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, with music from Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy, who wrote the sitcom theme tune. Only Fools and Horses comes from Jim Sullivan – son of John Sullivan (1946-2011), the TV comedy genius who created the series – and stars Paul Whitehouse. Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, creators of Goodnight Sweetheart, have also written the spin-off, encouraged by the success of Dreamboats and Petticoats, their jukebox musical based around 50s and 60s hits. More ominous is TV comedy’s poor record as the source of West End and Broadway shows. Acorn Antiques: The Musical (2005), adapted by Victoria Wood from the spoof soap opera featured in her sketch show, received a savaging from the ’s Michael Billington, who described it as “a load of slack, self-indulgent rubbish scandalously overpriced at £65 for a stalls ticket” – although a later cut-down version in Salford was better received. Harry Hill’s I Can’t Sing! The X Factor Musical, staged at the London Palladium in 2014, was spectacularly less successful than his TV work. Joke-box musicals have been an equally iffy proposition in the US. Sung and danced versions of Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, The Addams Family, Bewitched, Gilligan’s Island, I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners have either failed to reach Broadway or been critically assassinated there.  One reason that sitcoms have resisted orchestration is that, whereas the two-hour length of an average movie neatly fits a standard stage slot, a TV series may provide tens or even hundreds of hours of material, including cherished whole episodes that fans will know almost by heart. In this respect, it feels sensible that Linehan and Mathews have conjured up a new storyline, beyond the scope of the TV show, in which the Craggy Island parish priest unexpectedly becomes Pope Ted. This seems a clever way of keeping favourite characters while side-stepping the audience’s desire for karaoke renditions of beloved lines and moments. The latter pressure is an obvious obstacle for Only Fools and Horses: The Musical. The TV show’s single most famous moment – in which Del Boy falls to the floor while attempting to lean nonchalantly on an unfamiliar bar – is a carefully structured TV sight gag that would be difficult to reproduce in the vast wide-shot of stage picture. Apart from interrupting the script, there is also the risk that the lyrics would fight it. Both sitcom dialogue and good songs tend to be end-loaded towards clinching lines. A Dad’s Army musical would presumably have a number for Captain Mainwaring called Don’t Tell Him, Pike!, and another in which Corporal Jones reflects, of the British empire’s enemies, that: They Don’t Like It up ’Em! But it seems unlikely these punchlines would gain from being sung rather than said. Perhaps for this reason, a show called Dad’s Army: The Musical, which was staged in Britain in 1976 and revived in 2004-05, had a score that consisted of the TV series’s spoof-period theme song (“Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Hitler?”) and genuine 1940s compositions. The guess is that Marks and Gran’s Goodnight Sweetheart will also use the soundtrack of its era.If either Father Ted or Only Fools and Horses do succeed as musicals, there will inevitably be copycat projects. My hunch is that John Sullivan’s Just Good Friends might suit musical adaptation, as its on-off romantic story is well suited to the genre. But Are You Being Served? The Musical could be a camp classic, as the Mr Humphries solo “I’m Free!” almost writes itself, although the obvious torch song for Mrs Slocombe might struggle, as online rhyming dictionaries offer, for her signature word “pussy”, only “hussy”. But, sung in a northern accent, it could just work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae7a4bc709183579eebebf60dc3680ce48925dd/0_137_5013_3008/master/5013.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b8c2b395d7eb6a6415c85352b857eb","title":"beto orourke texas senate ted cruz election","story":"Beto O’Rourke has pledged to visit voters in all 254 Texas counties, most deeply Republican. Could this neighborly approach give an outsider the edge? Late in the afternoon of the last Friday in May, as the temperature soared over 100F (38C), the Democratic nominee for Senate in Texas was going door to door. There were not many doors to knock on: Mentone, in Loving county in the far west of the state, is home to perhaps two dozen people. But Beto O’Rourke had come as part of a pledge to visit all 254 counties, in his bid to unseat the Republican Ted Cruz.Unanimously, political analysts say the 45-year-old is a long-shot to reach the Senate. Cruz is a conservative leader who finished second to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential primary. Texas hasn’t sent a Democrat to the Senate since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988, when O’Rourke was in high school. The party hasn’t won a statewide race since 1994. Some recent polls have given O’Rourke hope, showing Cruz with a single-digit lead in a state where Republicans have grown accustomed to wins of 15 points or more. However, a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday showed Cruz 11 points ahead. In Mentone, O’Rourke got no answer at his first stop. But Stan Moore, a genial 70-year-old, invited O’Rourke inside a modest home he shares with his wife Ray, a Loving county native.“Well, I want to say something first,” Moore said with a smile. “I’m a Republican.” “That’s OK, there’s no obligation to vote for us,” said O’Rourke, a congressman from El Paso. What followed was an idealized – and nearly extinct – version of American politics. Candidate and voter had a respectful conversation about issues both global and hyper-local.They discussed the energy boom, which has swelled Loving county’s population from 82 in the 2010 census to an estimated 139 in 2017. (The county covers 677 sq miles, slightly larger than London.)When O’Rourke asked about national issues that concern him, Moore said: “Well, you know, the immigration thing is an issue. I wish something could be done to make things safer and let people who are good people come over, you know. And I know that’s a hard issue.”Candidate and voter spent five minutes talking about the US-Mexico border and how to get things done. O’Rourke is a fierce critic of Trump’s border and immigration policies Moore agrees with the president that more needs to be done to secure the border. But voices were never raised and both men smiled throughout.As the candidate prepared to leave, Moore talked about media coverage he had seen of a recent town hall meeting in Amarillo. “When I saw you on TV the other day,” he said, “to be honest with you, I was very impressed with you. As soon as I saw you and heard you speak on TV, I thought, ‘Man, that guy’s a sharp guy.’”Moore and O’Rourke shook hands and parted. No commitment for a vote was asked for or given. The candidate spent another 30 minutes in Mentone, talking with the owners of a food truck and convenience store who are doing pretty good business serving the men who work in the energy fields. Then O’Rourke drove off, headed for a rare weekend with his wife Amy and their three children.O’Rourke is running a campaign that is part 21st-century and part 19th. He has perhaps the most sophisticated digital political operation of the 2018 midterms, which has helped him raise a surprising $13m so far. He’s also running a retail campaign in a state with 28 million people and almost 270,000 square miles. As part of his pledge to visit every county, he has held hundreds of town hall meetings.Before coming to Loving county, O’Rourke held town halls for about 30 people in Hudspeth county and about 50 in Culberson. The stops were numbers 251, 252 and 253. Between them, the three counties cover an area larger than Wales but hold fewer than 6,000 people. Loving county is Texas’ least populated county and has the second-fewest residents of any in the US, ahead of only Kalawao county in Hawaii.O’Rourke will complete his 254-county tour on 9 June, with a visit to Cooke county in the north of the state.Loving is the extreme example of the challenges of old-style campaigning in Texas. Locals tell of Cruz’s campaign effort ahead of the Republican primary in March, which he won easily. His campaign RV rolled into Mentone and parked outside the courthouse. A couple of aides popped out, snapped a picture, jumped back in and rumbled away.Loving residents, of whom 106 are currently registered to vote, cast four ballots for Hillary Clinton in 2016 – her lowest vote total in any US county. On his visit, O’Rourke spoke to two, maybe three voters and spent eight hours on the road. But it was not an entirely quixotic quest – as he traveled across west Texas, he conducted multiple Facebook Live streams, each drawing thousands of viewers. O’Rourke said his pledge to visit all 254 counties is no gimmick, though he has also acknowledged that he will spend the final six months of the campaign focusing on the most populous areas. He said that coming from El Paso, on the far western edge of the state and in a different time zone than the rest of Texas, makes him appreciate towns and cities that often are ignored by politicians. “It’s the only way I can think of to get to know the people you want to represent and understand what’s most exciting to them and what they’re most concerned about,” he said.“Last time,” he said, “Sunday night a month ago, six weeks ago, a thousand people came out to that town hall … it works but as you can see, it’s time intensive, travel intensive. But it is worth it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64c947c5ef54aff873e412ab713253b9c763c5b8/0_167_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103a6401acf4e68e83b500caa0fb622c","title":"north koreas top three military officials sacked as nuclear summit nears","story":"US officials believe there was dissent over Kim Jong-un’s approach to foreign diplomacyNorth Korea’s top three military officials have been removed from their posts, a senior US official said on Sunday, a shakeup that could signal the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is working to silence dissent ahead of a summit with Donald Trump in Singapore next week. The US official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, was commenting on a report by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency that all three of the North’s top military officials were believed to have been replaced. Trump on Friday revived the proposed 12 June summit after cancelling it a week earlier. The US is seeking a negotiated end to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. US officials believe there was some dissent in the military about Kim’s approaches to South Korea and the US. Kim likely wants to ensure any deal struck in his meeting with Trump will not face opposition at home. Since coming to power in 2011, Kim has conducted several purges in an effort to consolidate power. The young leader was just 27 years old when he took power in a society that reveres older cadres. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said Kim might be using the upcoming summit “as leverage to get rid of internal hardliners”. It was also possible the “summit created such a risk to his internal power he felt he had to protect himself by moving people around”.“It’s worth considering whether this round of summit diplomacy has given Kim Jong-un an opportunity to get a more favourable group of people at the top,” Oba said.Kim had his uncle and potential rival for control, Jang Song-thaek, tried and executed in 2013. Kim’s older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated last year in an operation widely believed to have been directed from Pyongyang. The US official did not identify the three military officials. Yonhap identified them as defence chief Pak Yong-sik chief of the Korean People’s Army’s (KPA) general staff, Ri Myong-su and Kim Jong-gak, the director of the KPA’s General Political Bureau. Trump wants North Korea to “denuclearise,” meaning to get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. North Korea’s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival. Citing an unnamed intelligence official, Yonhap said No Kwang-chol, first vice minister of the Ministry of People’s armed forces, had replaced Pak Yong-sik, while Ri Myong-su was replaced by his deputy, Ri Yong-gil. It said army general Kim Su-gil’s replacement of Kim Jong-gak was confirmed in a North Korean state media report last month. The White House, State Department, CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for official comment. Lower-level US-North Korean talks to prepare for the summit are continuing but have made only “halting progress,” according to a second US official briefed on the discussions. That official said US negotiators’ efforts to press for definitions of immediate, comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation by North Korea had run into opposition from the White House. In a remarkable shift in tone eight days after cancelling the summit, citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility,” Trump welcomed North Korea’s former intelligence chief Kim Yong-chol to the White House on Friday, afterward exchanging smiles and handshakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f9af1fd938147d2d0a523ebc693ceff1b52605/0_22_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92c3ff913cae0c3f79d43289b8e26fbb","title":"philippine president criticised for kissing woman on stage","story":"Rodrigo Duterte accused of ‘despicable display of sexism and grave abuse of authority’The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, has been criticised for kissing a married woman in front of thousands of cheering supporters.Duterte, 73, dismissed the kiss as a “gimmick” to entertain supporters at a meet-and-greet event with overseas Filipino workers in South Korea on Sunday evening. But one senator called the act “a despicable display of sexism and grave abuse of authority”.Duterte sought a kiss from the woman after he called her on stage to give her a copy of a book at the event in Seoul. When Duterte asked if she could explain to her husband that the antic was just a joke, and she said yes, the president leaned in and kissed her as thousands erupted in cheers.The scene was broadcast live by the state-run TV network to the Philippines.The woman has defended the kiss and said she was thrilled by her encounter but others said the president went too far.“President Duterte acted like a feudal king who thinks that being the president is an entitlement to do anything that he pleases,” said Sen Risa Hontiveros. “Even if the act was consensual, it was the president, possessed of awesome, even intimidating, power, who initiated it.”Gabriela, a leftwing women’s party, condemned Duterte’s act, which it said underscored his “machismo and misogyny”. In addition to growing alarm over his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs, which has left thousands of mostly poor drug suspects dead, Duterte has come under fire from women’s groups for sexist remarks, including one where he told troops to shoot female insurgents “in the vagina” during a public outburst against communist guerrillas.He has publicly kissed women in the past, included at rallies during his campaign for the presidency.The latest incident came near the end of a two-hour rambling speech, when Duterte offered the crowd a book about alleged corruption and abuse in the Catholic church. He pointed at two women.“There’s payment for this, a kiss. You in white, are you ready to engage in kissing? Come here,” the 73-year-old Duterte said as summoned the women to the stage.One of the women gave the president a peck on the cheek. The other woman reached for the president’s hand and put it on her forehead in a traditional gesture of respect for an elder. But the president asked her to come closer for a kiss, pointing to his lips.Amid the roar of the crowd, Duterte asked the woman was married and if her husband was around. He inquired if she could explain to her husband that what they were about to do was just a joke.She said her husband was not there and replied yes to the president’s other question.“Make him jealous,” the president said.Duterte then leaned in and kissed the visibly overwhelmed woman, who screamed in joy and covered her face. He then hugged her.“Don’t take that seriously,” Duterte later told the crowd. “It’s just to give people fun.”The woman, who is married to a South Korean and has two daughters, later said in a TV interview that she was thrilled by her encounter with the president. She said there was “no malice” in the kiss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ce2a6de1c735f9eb2fb02e9e40900dc68ef349d/0_184_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a4381fa24276a774c441e6557e3bb73","title":"virunga national park congo closes tourists 2019 security","story":"Security review to take place after 12 rangers are killed and two Britons are abductedAfrica’s oldest national park will close its gates to visitors until 2019 following the death of a ranger and the abduction of two British tourists by local rebels this year.Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is home to a world-famous population of mountain gorillas but has been hit by rising instability and violence in the country.At least 12 rangers have been killed in clashes with militia and smugglers in Virunga in the last 10 months, one of the bloodiest periods in the park’s history.In May, one of the many local militia – known as Mai Mai – attacked a vehicle that had been carrying tourists from the city of Goma, about 30 miles from the park headquarters, to their accommodation. A park ranger, Rachel Makissa Baraka, 25, was shot dead, a Congolese driver was wounded and the two British tourists, Robert Jesty and Bethan Davies, were held by militia overnight.Tourist activities in the park had initially been suspended until 4 June while the incident was investigated. But in a statement on Monday, Emmanuel de Merode, the Belgian aristocrat who is director of the park, said the decision had been taken reluctantly to close Virunga to tourists until the end of the year to allow a thorough review of security precautions and reinforcement of the 700 rangers deployed to keep animals and visitors safe.“The safety of our visitors will always be our highest priority ... It is abundantly clear that the Virunga is deeply affected by insecurity and that this will be the case for some time. For Virunga to be safely visited, much more robust measures are necessary than in the past,” Merode said in a statement, describing the decision as “profoundly difficult”.More than 180 rangers have been killed in Virunga over the last 20 years, making the park one of the most dangerous conservation projects in the world. Six died in an ambush in April. The loss of life was the worst in a single incident in the park’s history.Virunga is located in the DRC’s North Kivu province, and covers nearly 8,000 square miles. As well as being home to one of the world’s largest populations of the critically endangered mountain gorillas, it has hundreds of other rare species.The park, which recently announced that the gorillas number more than a thousand, faces multiple security threats, including illegal charcoal production, smuggling, poaching as well as the Mai Mai militia.In recent months, the DRC has appeared close to plunging back into the appalling violence of the 1997 to 2003 civil war, in which about 5 million people died. The violence has been aggravated by continuing political instability, with President Joseph Kabila refusing to step down after the end of his second term in 2016 and new elections scheduled for December this year.Observers noted that Virunga’s planned reopening would occur after this critical date, when tensions may have subsided. Virunga National Park was founded in 1925 by Belgian colonial authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2c1bf8bc510f7a89767644609c6c5abf716111/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c255d3a7c592e951c4ff98e384a218","title":"guatemalas fuego volcano erupts in pictures","story":"At least 25 people have been killed and nearly 300 injured in the most violent eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano in more than 40 years, officials said.

our Go Fund Me page to raise money for a possible judicial review has raised €29,059 from 469 different donors and it’s a very solid spread of donations – everything from €500 to €20 which reflects a very broad range of support,” she said. “The fact that so many people have come on board to support our campaign and a possible judicial review shows the depth of feeling on this issue.”Ms Hurley said Chase are consulting with their legal advisors about whether it will be possible to seek a judicial review of the decision which would cost between €150,000 and €200,000She said the site chosen by Indaver has since been rezoned by Cork County Council and would require a material contravention of the county development plan to allow it proceed.That in turn would require members of Cork County Council to vote for a material contravention which doesn’t seem likely at the moment given the widespread political opposition from the vast majority of public representatives in the area to the incinerator proposal, she said.“Cork Harbour has changed hugely since 2001 when Indaver first proposed to build an incinerator at Ringaskiddy - the area has seen major advances in terms of education facilities with the National Maritime College of Ireland and various research projects in Ringaskiddy“Added to that, we’ve seen where Cork County Council has begun developing Spike Island as a major international tourist attraction while the clean-up of the former Irish Steel plant at Haulbowline will lead to the creation of a public park and amenity area there.The decision to grant planning permission for the facility was welcomed by Indaver Ireland managing director John Ahern last week who said the project was in line with regional, national and EU waste policy.“We are pleased that An Bord Pleanála has decided to grant permission for our Ringaskiddy project, however, we are conscious that this decision simply marks another step in a long process,” said Mr Ahern who pointed out Ireland currently exports significant amounts of residual municipal waste"},{"url":null,"title":"joyous and tearful scenes in dublin castle as eighth amendment to be repealed","story":"  May 27, 2018Ireland has voted No to tribalism and fear in overwhelming decision to remove the Eighth   May 27, 2018Thirty-five years after its introduction, Eighth Amendment repealed after bitter campaign   May 28, 2018Cheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fight   June 1, 2018The victory belongs to everyone but any analysis that does not place at its centre the feminist, women-led movement is bereft "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours the HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyLove Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestants as it starts on ITVWhy the EU\u0026#39s liberal centre is disintegrating in the face of a populist surge -

If kids get used to it, what do they have to work towards? It seems like an absurd waste of money and very spoiling. I suspect Gordon Ramsay and I can’t be the only ones to think this.”She and her partner Ben Andersen occasionally upgrade to more expensive seats, she said, while her children Bay, 12, and Oscar, 10, sit in economy.Furious critics responded, with one tweeting: As an ex crew member I hated it when parents did this.One child spilt drink all over herself and the parents left us crew to sort it out...unfair on the crew or other pax who ended up as babysitters...while parents quaffed champagne in Club.Another wrote: Until they are adult, it\u0027s the parents job to PARENT not the Cabin Crew! Those children need looking after on a flight. I\u0027d never have left mine.She responded, telling her Twitter followers: People parent differently, I think letting 10 year olds have social media accounts is far more risky than anything that could happen on a plane, and the biggest dangers come from adolescent mental health issues. #horsesforcourses.Gordon Ramsay agrees, and said earlier this year: They get entertainment on their iPads.

The IATA expects airlines to report a collective net profit of $33.8bn in 2018, and said this would be a “a solid performance despite rising costs, primarily fuel and labor, but also the upturn in the interest rate cycle”. The US central bank raised interest rates in March, and the Bank of England is widely expected to hike rates in the coming months.In addition, oil prices have been climbing in recent weeks, and in May broke past the $80 per barrel mark for the first time in three and a half years after President Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal. The IATA said it expects the full-year average cost of Brent crude oil to be $70 per barrel, up 27.5 per cent from the average of $59.40 per barrel in 2017, while jet fuel prices are set to rise 25.9 per cent to $84 per barrel. The forecast net profit for this year has been revised down from a previous estimate of $38.4bn, and the IATA’s expected 2018 profit would also come in well below the record $38bn reported by airlines last year.The group also said operating profits, “though still high by past standards, have been trending slowly downwards since early 2016, as a result of accelerating costs”.Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO, said: “Solid profitability is holding up in 2018, despite rising costs. The industry’s financial foundations are strong with a nine-year run in the black that began in 2010. And the return on invested capital will exceed the cost of capital for a fourth consecutive year. “At long last, normal profits are becoming normal for airlines. This enables airlines to fund growth, expand employment, strengthen balance sheets and reward our investors.”Meanwhile, growing uncertainty about global affairs “could present risks to the industry’s outlook”, according to the IATA. The group said particular risks included the advancement of political forces pushing a protectionist agenda, uncertainty following the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and a lack of clarity on the impact of Brexit.“Aviation spreads prosperity and enriches the human spirit. That truth lays the foundation for a very important message. The world is better off when borders are open to people and to trade. And our hard work as an industry has primed aviation to be an even stronger catalyst for an ever more inclusive globalization,” said Mr de Juniac.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It’s a shame we can’t be more grown up about it, we aren’t asking for ra-ra skirts or skinny jeans, just grey tailored shorts for two months a year, it’s not a big deal.”Some other\u0026nbspparents also criticised the\u0026nbspnew uniform, which also introduced blazers, as they did not\u0026nbspfeel the clothing was appropriate for warmer months.\u0026nbspWith temperatures set to reach 26C this week, parents were keen for their children\u0026nbspto feel comfortable in the heat.The stricter clothing policy was one of the changes brought in since the school was placed in special measures, after receiving an “inadequate”\u0026nbsprating by Ofsted inspectors in spring last year.But the school appears to be making progress and the latest Ofsted monitoring inspection from November 2017, said: “Pupils value their new uniform, and they are smart and polite and most conduct themselves well.”\u0026nbspHeadteacher Moira Green, who also introduced longer teaching hours since taking on the role, was credited with helping to turn the school around.\u0026nbspShe explained that she decided to remove shorts from the uniform after a consultation, as it was decided more business-like attire was the way to go.Ms Green issued a statement which said: “In September 2017, with the support of parents, Chiltern Edge made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been a success.”She added that the uniform policy was generic which meant that it could be purchased from anywhere, and the only piece of branded attire was a school tie, which was given to existing students for free.\u0026nbspThe issue, she said, was simply that shorts do not feature\u0026nbspas part of the main school uniform.\u0026nbspThe school – which was previously threatened with closure but has since been saved – will be turned into an academy and become part of the Maiden Erlegh Trust in August.Ms Green added: “Maiden Erlegh Trust, in preparation for September 2018, wholeheartedly support Chiltern Edge’s adoption of a more formal uniform.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Humans themselves even interbred with Neanderthals at some point in history, with many modern humans still carrying traces of\u0026nbspNeanderthal\u0026nbspDNA\u0026nbspin their genes.This new discovery is significant as it means there is yet another member of the great ape family with whom humans might share a common ancestor.Unfortunately the DNA fragments discovered within the bonobo only amount to roughly 3 per cent of the extinct ape\u0027s genome, making learning specifics about the new species\u0026nbspdifficult.Finding physical remains\u0026nbspis also unlikely because of the length of time involved, with Mr\u0026nbspKuhlwilm\u0026nbsprating the odds of finding an intact sample\u0026nbsplow.The ghost chimps\u0026nbspwould have died out long before Homo sapiens came on the scene around 300,000 years ago.Changes in environment have often forced\u0026nbspdifferent species to interbreed.Scientists have started witnessing\u0026nbspgrizzly bears and polar bears create offspring as climate change forces their natural environments closer to one another.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

At the time, it was reported that a new solution would be ready by March 2019, but the timetable appears to have slipped again, with no date now set for completion.Former transport secretary Lord Adonis said the government’s planning had been “ostrich-like”, while a spokesperson for Highways England said they would attempt to avoid disruption.If Britain cannot reach a deal with the European Union it will crash out in March 2019 with no transition period and will immediately face customs checks and paperwork for the millions of trucks that pour off ferries and Channel Tunnel shuttles every year.In recent weeks the Department for Transport unveiled contingency plans to convert part of the M20 motorway carriageway into a lorry park as a temporary stopgap – causing huge disruption to motorists and freight.The threat of a no deal\u0026nbspis looming larger than ever in Brussels, with no significant progress for months, issues thought to be settled in December rearing their heads again, and EU officials describing the UK’s approach as “fantasy”.Lord Adonis, a supporter for the Best For Britain anti-Brexit campaign, told The Independent that Britain was being left “dangerously vulnerable” by the government’s lack of preparations.“This failure to invest in – or prepare for – Brexit is emblematic of a government that seems incapable of taking its own policies seriously,” he said.“These delays may well end up causing queues of lorries for miles and miles, clogging up Kent and beyond and causing shortages of goods in our supermarkets.“This is just one of a number of areas where the government’s ostrich-like behaviour is leaving Britain dangerously vulnerable. I have just visited Rotterdam to see for myself the chaos that Brexit will cause our international trade.”Though Brexiteers have been keen to stress that they are leaving the EU rather than Europe, there are a number of major physical changes that will be need to be made in time for the UK’s departure whether or not a deal is reached.Theresa May has ruled out membership of the single market and customs union, meaning traders will face customs and regulatory checks upon entering the UK from Europe. This will require the expansion of physical infrastructure at ports and airports. Though the government wants a two-year transition period to give it time to prepare for Brexit, there will be none in the event of a “no deal”.As part of the preparations, the Highways Agency says it wants to “develop one or more lorry-holding areas to reduce the congestion in Kent caused by cross-Channel disruption”, with the M20 and M2 motorways into Dover the focus of expansion.\u0026nbspThe new infrastructure is at the very early planning stage, however.The Highways Agency does not mention Brexit in its consultation document on the new lorry parks, referring euphemistically instead to “disruptive events” that could cause them to be needed.Road infrastructure in the region already regularly goes over capacity in the event of poor weather or industrial action, and Kent Police have developed an approach called Operation Stack where part of the M20 motorway is converted into a temporary lorry park. The procedure has been implemented dozens of times in the last few decades.As well as the planned construction work on the south coast, the Home Office also revealed at the end of March that it was facing the task of recruiting an extra 1,000 border staff for Brexit.Other countries that see a lot of trade with Britain are also making similar preparations. The Netherlands is recruiting over 700 customs officers for the port of Rotterdam and Schipol airport, major hubs that connect the UK to world markets. The port of Rotterdam itself predicts 9km of traffic jams on its side of the channel in the event of a “no deal” scenario.A consultation document drawn up by the Highways Agency says: “Forecasts tell us that trafﬁc is expected to increase on the M20A20 and M2A2. The number of lorries travelling to and from the Kent ports is also expected to increase significantly.“Since severe weather, equipment failure and other disruptive events can never be completely avoided, the risk is that Operation Stack will be implemented more frequently if action is not taken. Without action, the safety and journey time reliability of everybody using the motorways, major and local roads in Kent is likely to be affected.”A Highways England spokesperson said: “We are clear that the disruption that people in Kent suffered in summer 2015 should never happen again.“We are starting a public information exercise soon which will take a completely fresh look at long term solutions for Operation Stack and will ask people living, travelling and working in Kent for their views on what they’d like to see. The date these measures will be in place will depend on what option is chosen.“In the meantime, we are taking steps to increase the resilience of the road network, including a contraflow on the M20 which will be available for use early next year. This will increase the options available if there is the need to deal with any potential disruption.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The approach on services therefore should be about managing ergence.”Ministers are under pressure to come up with some commonly agreed proposals that are acceptable to Brussels by the European Council summit meeting towards the end of the month.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In most circumstances, if\u0026nbspone dies, quits or\u0026nbspretires then the successor is voted for by members of their own party.Analysis by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) found that the average electorate for normal hereditary by-election\u0026nbspis only 32 voters, with only 29 people usually turning out.The group\u0026nbspfound that four by-elections had more candidates than electors in recent years – including a by-election for Labour hereditary peers with\u0026nbsp11 candidates and only three voters.Some 3,190 votes have been cast in the last 32 by-elections, which began in 2003, compared to the last 32 Commons by-elections, where 931,725 votes have been cast.ERS chief executive\u0026nbspDarren Hughes\u0026nbspsaid: “These so-called by-elections are an undemocratic farce – and make mockery of our democracy.“This time, around 25 peers are set to decide which aristocrat remains in parliament to vote on our laws, for the rest of their lives. “That is not democracy – and it’s time we ended this bizarre hangover from feudal times. \u0026nbsp“It’s vital for trust and faith in our democracy that the forthcoming farce of a by-election – brought about by the retirement of Earl Baldwin of Bewdley – will be the last. “The public should decide who votes on our laws – not a tiny clique of aristocrats.”Labour peer Lord Grocott\u0026nbspis trying to axe the by-elections through a private members’ bill but his efforts were blocked by a handful of hereditary peers in March.However,\u0026nbspConservative frontbencher Lord Young of Cookham\u0026nbspsaid the government “will not obstruct” his bill and offered it more parliamentary time.Lord Grocott\u0026nbsptold The Independent:\u0026nbsp“These were only supposed to be a temporary measure but it’s now gone on for 19 years.“There have been 32 hereditary by-elections, so I mean that’s a third of all hereditary peers who have been replaced. It’s ridiculous.“You have this situation where the government is trying to reduce the size of the Lords and the House of Commons but you have 92 peers who cannot be touched.”Only one woman is eligible to stand in the upcoming by-election out of more than 200 candidates, and just 31 peers will be able to vote, according to a written parliamentary question to Lord Grocott.The poll will also cost taxpayers more than £1,140 to stage.Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the issue was “another reminder of how archaic, undemocratic and outdated” the Lords is.“Liberal Democrats have long argued for an elected upper chamber, but sadly attempts to introduce reform were thwarted by the self-interest of the other two parties,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Isn’t it ironic, however, that murmurs from the Tories have changed in recent weeks as a result of the Lords defeating them on the EU Withdrawal Bill on fifteen occasions?”Lord Fowler, the Lords speaker, has welcomed efforts to slash the size of the upper chamber\u0026nbspafter a key Lords committee\u0026nbsprecommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in numbers.\u0026nbspA Lords spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The House of Lords recognises the need for reform and, following a report from the Lord Speaker’s committee on the size of the house in October 2017, showed overwhelming\u0026nbspsupport for reducing and capping the size of the house, and for linking new appointments to general election results.”It comes after\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspaccused of\u0026nbsp“hypocrisy” after appointing nine new Tory peers to the House of Lords, including several ex-ministers, despite promising that senior politicians would not receive automatic ennoblement.Her announcement coincided with the eve of the royal wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, prompting claims that the prime minister had tried to\u0026nbspsneak out the news when it would receive little attention.Candidates for the upcoming by-election will be announced on 15 June, with the count on 4 July.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All London boroughs have signed up to the online resource, which also seeks to help people find affordable homes.The mayor’s\u0026nbsprevised housing strategy also includes an additional £1.67bn of affordable housing investment the mayor secured from government earlier this year. The “majority” of this will be spent on new homes on social rent levels, the mayor said.In April the mayor said work started on a “record” 12,500 affordable\u0026nbspproperties in 2017-18, up from\u0026nbsp6,725 in 2016-17.Regardless, questions have been raised about Mr Khan’s ability to tackle the size of the capital’s housing crisis, since\u0026nbspprivate developers have proved reluctant to build large quantities of affordable homes.Despite Mr Khan’s objections, a\u0026nbspdevelopment of 700 homes in Ilford\u0026nbspincluded just 4 per cent\u0026nbspaffordable housing. The borough has a policy where 50 per cent of all new homes should be affordable.Mr Khan’s demand that a social housing tenant be appointed\u0026nbspcommissioner\u0026nbspcame after evidence\u0026nbsphearings in\u0026nbspthe Grenfell\u0026nbspTower inquiry began\u0026nbspon Monday. Expert reports released on the morning documented a catalogue of serious safety breaches that contributed to the blaze that killed 72 people.More than 150 social tower blocks across England have been found to have aluminum\u0026nbspcomposite material (ACM) cladding, blamed for spreading the fire in north Kensington in the early hours of 14 June.Yet\u0026nbspthe latest statistics have revealed only 10 of those high-rises have had the panelling replaced.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called A Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/as-graphic-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"liam fox brexit power britain","story":"Why? Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze. But it is time to stop knee-jerk grievance merchants portraying this tragedy as a callous act of politically-motivated spite.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The manoeuvre caused the infant’s legs, arms and torso to become detached, leaving the head still in his mother’s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant’s head.It was ”re-attached” to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is believed the child was already dead before he was decapitated during the 15-minute delivery.Mr Tim Bradbury, chairing the tribunal, said: “The tribunal found that the breech extraction and consequent use of traction was necessitated by Dr Laxman’s earlier decision to proceed with a vaginal delivery and which is the subject of the tribunal’s finding.“Laxman’s conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation.“But for Laxman’s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.”He added that Laxman had not sufficiently addressed in her mind the risk to Baby B by proceeding with a vaginal delivery - namely the risk of head entrapment and the delay this complication would inevitably cause.The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The womans waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mothers cervix was between 2-4cm dilated.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm.She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later while discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: We are not doing a c-section - you would never do a c-section of a 25 weeker.She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her too push.Last month consultant Laxman, who denied misconduct, said the youngster would have died had a C-section been carried out during the procedure on March 16 2014.She told the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester: “I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard.“I did not intend to harm mum or the baby.I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”Laxman qualified as a doctor in Chennai, India, in 1999.The mother – known only as Patient A – came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: “I don’t forgive you – I don’t forgive you” as the doctor stared down at the floor.The patient then looked away as Laxman’s QC apologised on her behalf.The mother added: “I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated.“I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn’t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible.“Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.”The tribunal panel will now decide whether or not Laxman remains fit to continue practicing as a doctor."},{"url":null,"title":"russian tv news photoshops smile onto kim jong un as he meets top moscow official to make him appear happier","story":"The dictator met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Pyongyang on Thursday, just weeks before a planned meeting between the US and the North Korean regime.Although Kim did crack a smile during other parts of the meeting, the photos and footage of the moment he posed for the cameras during a handshake with Lavrov show him stony-faced.But a segment about the meeting during the programme News of the Week on pro-Putin TV station Russia 1 featured a still of Kim smiling alongside Lavrov.A photo of the same moment published on the official Twitter of the Russian Foreign Ministry also shows Kim looking grim-faced.Bloomberg Moscow deputy bureau chief Scott Rose tweeted: “Russian state TV, rising to the occasion, photoshopped a smile onto North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at his meeting with Lavrov.”The host of the show is Dmitry Kiselyov, who has been called a Putin propagandist and claims the US is in league with terror group ISIS.Lavrov became the first top-ranking Russian to meet with the current head of North Korea.The pair met ahead of the much talked about meeting between Trump and Kim scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.The Foreign Minister reportedly invited Kim Jong-un to Russia.In return Kim thanked him for the invitation and asked him to convey his greetings to Vladimir Putin and the Russian people.Russia 1 has been contacted for a comment."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/walk-walking-healthy-sky-news_4327774.jpg?20180604094215 ","title":"italys new pm named as little known professor giuseppe conte","story":"The 5-Star Movement defended Mr Conte, saying he \"never boasted\" of holding degrees from foreign universities, but \"stayed abroad to study, enrich his knowledge and perfect his juridical English\".Mr Conte also has to convince his critics that he has the independence to lead the coalition government - and not just execute the wishes of the parties that support him.The law professor, who has a reputation as a snappy dresser, was born in Volturara Appula, a town of 467 residents near Foggia, in the region of Puglia.The 53-year-old currently teaches law in Florence and Rome.He graduated top of his class from the University of Rome in 1988 and now sits on several high-profile boards, publishing legal texts and advising on company administration.:: Why markets are fretting over Italy\u0027s coalitionAn expert in civil and commercial law, Mr Conte has also served on a government administrative justice council.In that role, he presided over a commission that ousted a public administration official who had demanded that female students in his law course for aspiring magistrates wear mini-skirts to class.Although he is not a politician, Mr Conte was named as a potential public administration minister by Mr Di Maio before Italy\u0027s election in March.

It is up to the Speaker who is hauled before the Commons but you suspect Chris Grayling will be requested to account for the meltdown in the railways, especially in the north of England .   MPs are also pushing for an emergency debate on abortion in Northern Ireland – the Downing Street line this is a devolved matter is looking increasingly tenuous – and a statement on the looming trade war with the United States.   Someone may also chance his or her arm and call for a statement on the leaked papers showing the doomsday consequence of walking away from the EU without a deal.   Then there is Sajid Javid’s re-writing of Theresa May’s immigration policy - the cap on skilled workers looks set for scrap heap.        Sitting in the middle of this swirling storm of problems, her cagoule pulled tightly over her face, is our besieged Prime Minister.   Mrs May has received plaudits for her resilience but the paralysis at the heart of government is a reminder of her limitations.   She is an over-promoted municipal politician who would struggle to make a decision on planning permission for a conservatory let alone something as all-encompassing as Brexit.   We should not be surprised the Department for Brexit has game planned a no deal scenario and concluded it would be disastrous.   Anyone who has half an eye on the Brexit understood the implications of falling back on World Trade Organisation rules without resolving hundreds of issues ranging from our membership of the European medicines agency to the collection of VAT on foreign imports.   Brussels has been aware of this from the off which is why they always knew Mrs May’s ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ was posturing.   With time pressing and Cabinet differences apparently insoluble, the greater the likelihood that it will be left to Parliament to determine what sort of Brexit we have.   Having campaigned to take back control Brexiteers are in no position to complain about this.   And there was a strong argument that Mrs May should have taken a more consensual route in the first place.   But it does mean Downing Street and the Cabinet are struggling to keep control of events which adds to the uncertainty that so unnerves business.   This is a message the bosses of leading firms will convey when they meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street today.

But pressed on whether Mrs May still believed that no deal would be better than a bad deal, the PM\u0027s official spokesman said: Yes. The spokesman insisted the Government still believed it could achieve a good deal with the EU before we leave next year.  But he pointedly played down hopes that such a deal could be reached by the time of the next European Summit council. The spokesman described this month\u0027s summit in Brussels as only a staging post to the Autumm and said the Government was instead working to an agreement in October. It comes after documents reportedly drawn up by government officials suggested a no-deal Brexit could lead to fuel, food and medicine shortages within two weeks of us leaving the EU.  The ‘doomsday’ scenario was produced by civil servants for Brexit Secretary David Davis, according to the Sunday Times.  They’re understood to have imagined three scenarios for what could happen if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal - a mild one, a severe one - and one branded “armageddon.” Even the moderate case, they say, would see the port of Dover collapse on day one.

The witness, who did not want to be named, said that the pooch could be heard crying and howling as the mercury rose on Sunday afternoon. The customer was concerned enough to start taking pictures and even timed how long it took for the dog\u0027s owner to return to his distressed pet.  In total, 20 minutes passed before the dog was released from the hot vehicle, Somerset Live reported.  I could hear the dog crying and howling and I could see the window was only cracked open a little bit, the onlooker said.  I timed how long the dog was in the car for and it was 20 minutes until the owner came to the car to let the dog out. It\u0027s thought an announcement was made over the tannoy at the Sainsbury\u0027s store in Sherborne, Dorset, to call for the dog to be let out at around 3pm. The RSPCA has repeatedly warned of the dangers of shutting dogs in hot cars in recent years - even if it\u0027s only for a few minutes. A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: “It’s important to remember not to leave any animal in a car or caravan, or in a conservatory or outbuilding, where temperatures can quickly rise, even when it doesn’t feel that warm outside.

Nicholas Mitchell, a software developer, decided to put his IT skills to good use when he was constantly late due to delays or cancellations and was blocked by the company when he complained online. The app,– wryly named Northern Fail – records every time a train is delayed or cancelled, acting as a historical database so people can look back and monitor the operator’s performance. Nicholas set up the app week before the now-infamous timetable changes took place across the country, when he was already struggling to get to work on time due to disruption.  He gets the train every day from his home in Urmston, Greater Manchester to his work in Ancoats, reports the Manchester Evening News .   He said: “I just sat back and thought ‘I’m getting ignored, I’m being blocked’. “I thought to myself, ‘how can I use the skills I have in my job as a software developer?’ And that’s when i thought about setting up the app. “Things were already bad before the timetable, and they’ve just got even worse since. I didn’t even know there was going to be a timetable change at the time.” The app simply works by collating data every time a full or a part cancellation is announced on the Northern Rail website. Nicholas, who works at Shaping Cloud in Ancoats, said 5,000 people have already downloaded Northern Fail, and the reaction has been really positive online.  He said: “I’ve had some really good feedback from people saying technology is political. They say there’s nothing else like it. The Northern website only records live cancellations, so it’s really useful. I’ve had messages from Andy Burnham thanking me. When I first saw the data on the app, I thought it must be broken when I saw how many cancellations there were. “It’s got even worse since the timetable change. I’ve been getting some messages saying some last minute cancellations aren’t even being recorded on the app, so the figures could actually be a lot worse.” Issues following the timetable change, on Sunday, May 20, have meant that he struggles to get home from work, and has resorted to getting the bus. On Thursday, four consecutive trains from Oxford Road to Urmston were cancelled, meaning he would have had no chance of getting back home within a reasonable hour.

Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 43, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the premature infant was in a breech position. But she instead attempted to carry out the delivery naturally before tragedy struck when the doctor urged the patient to push whilst herself applying traction to the baby\u0027s legs. The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb. Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman. Measures were taken so the mother could hold her son before saying goodbye.  At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, consultant Laxman who qualified in Chennai, India, denied wrongdoing saying she believed the baby would have died had a caesarean section been carried out.  But at a finding of facts hearing panel chairman Tim Bradbury said: It was Dr Laxman\u0027s decision in this regard that was to dictate her subsequent actions and the course of events which ultimately led to Baby B being decapitated. \u0027The Tribunal was in no doubt that throughout her involvement in the attempted delivery of Baby B, she was endeavouring to achieve the best outcome for Patient A and Baby B. Mr Bradbury went on to explain how Dr Vaishnavy Laxman had not thought through the consequences of a natural delivery. He concluded: The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time. The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors. The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.   Man \u0027ashamed of having fourth child\u0027 kisses newborn baby goodbye before abandoning infant in church  Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical. Later whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: We are not doing a c-section - you would never do a c-section of a 25 weeker. She then carried out an examination of the woman and told her to push. Mr Bradbury added: Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.

Nathan Rees posted a Tweet to easyJet on Friday night after the airline was forced to cancel a flight to Prague, saying he would be taking legal action against them. More than 140 people were left disappointed after the flight from Bristol Airport to the Czech capital was cancelled after a group of revellers treated the plane like a nightclub, reports BristolLive . But Nathan slammed easyJet for destroying his stag do, and said that the head of their cabin crew should be sacked.

Writing to private pilot Joe Roberts, Nathan said: No one was shouting and swearing you tool of a guy. Wind your neck in. Got no time for your opinions. If you honestly can say we deserved to get thrown off that plane well so be it. We have a number of people who are going to stand in our corner for this.

Nathan is set to marry long-term girlfriend Stephanie Lewis, 31, from Treharris in Wales. There has been confusion as to why the flight actually had to be cancelled. Bristol Live report that it wasn\u0027t just the rowdy behaviour of a minority which led to the flight\u0027s cancellation.  While police and easyJet staff were delayed dealing with the disruption, the weather forecast developed. EasyJet released an initial statement about the incident which the company then updated late on Saturday evening. In the update a spokeswoman explained that it was the bad weather which ultimately led to the flight being cancelled - and around 140 people having to get off the plane before it had moved at Bristol Airport. However, it\u0027s thought that if there hadn\u0027t been bad behaviour, the flight might have been able to take off safely before the weather became an issue. An EasyJet spokesman said: EasyJet was required to cancel flight EZY6267 from Bristol to Prague on June 1 due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board which caused a delay - the flight was further delayed and then cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. She went on to apologise for the effects on passengers and said it had done what it could to help those affected. The spokeswoman added: “EasyJet’s crew did everything possible to minimise the disruption for our remaining passengers who have been given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or receiving a refund.  EasyJet also provided hotel accommodation and meals for those passengers who required them. “Our crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time. “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board and always push for prosecution. “The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet\u0027s highest priority.” A police officer, Nick Falconer, took to Twitter to share pictures of the police operation.

Despite this when the Daily Mirror received a dramatic telephone call at 10.15am on May 1, 1968 no-one could have predicted the tale which would emerge. A man said he wanted to talk about a friend and a serious crime. He was to solve a mystery which had baffled police who had been called to a countryside cottage where firefighters had found a body. The mystery caller said he would arrive at the office in about fifteen minutes. At 10.30am, the man arrived at the main door in London\u0027s Holborn and was shown to a third floor waiting room.  He was scruffily dressed and looked tired. In quiet, jerky sentences, he told about a crime that he said he knew had been committed. He said he had a friend who knew all about a murder and he was waiting at London Bridge railway station. At first, he would not give his name, but as details tumbled out he could not keep up his pretence. There is no friend, it is me, he confessed. He was 28-year-old Hungarian chef Imre Gathy, and he described how on the Saturday before he had left his wife and two young children, at home in Harrington Road, Brighton. He said he had rowed with his wife after losing his job and had set out to look for work.  As he walked out of the seaside town along the A23 towards Gatwick a car pulled up. Inside was a man who it later transpired was retired naval Lieutenant Commander Humphrey Gilbert Grace. Grace had had a religious conversion almost a decade before when his mother had died suddenly. While he was away at the funeral his younger son was blinded in one eye in an accident. Since then, he had developed a fondness for picking up down and outs and taking them back his family home while his wife was away.  On this weekend Mr Grace\u0027s wife and teenage daughter were on holiday in Greece and two sons at boarding school when he offered Gathy a lift. The 29-year-old got into the green 1965 Morris Mini-traveller and the pair drove off towards Gatwick. As they got near Gatwick, Gathy said he asked to be dropped off as he knew the manager of the airline canteen. But Grace said that he could call him from his nearby home, and so they drove to October House. Once inside Gathy said he had a wash and called his friend at Gatwick Airport at 4pm, but it was his day off. He had tea with Grace, and, according to Gathy, the retired naval officer started to talk about God and read from the Bible until about 11pm.  Grace then showed his guest to a bedroom, which was a back room with a single bed where he slept until the morning. The next morning, Gathy said that he wanted to contact his wife, but claims that Grace said that he should let her wait adding that the man should wear the trousers. Reports at the time said that Gathy claimed later that Grace came out directly talking about the subject of homosexuality, saying that the Bible spoke of \u0027Love thy neighbour\u0027 - he took it to mean that you could love another man like your wife. He claimed Grace\u0027s response was to put his hand on the top of his leg. Gathy said he struck Grace with the back of his fist and that the older man jumped up and started shouting and screaming. He said that he then came towards him and he fell out of the back of his chair. Gathy said he grabbed a doorstop and hit the commander over the head - killing him. He said he panicked, and thinking he would make the crime look like a robbery, stole some silverware and fled back to Brighton. He twice tried to set fire to the house where he had killed Mr Grace, but the fire did not take and smoke was spotted by neighbours who alerted fire fighters who found the body. Gathy said he decided to hand himself in, but instead of going to the police station called the Daily Mirror to confess.

Chiltern Edge Secondary School in Oxfordshire has banned shorts from the uniform, insisting boys who are too hot in trousers should wear a skirt instead. The policy change comes as more schools across the country begin adopting more \u0027gender-neutral\u0027 approach to governing. A parent of a pupil at Chiltern Edge, Alastair Vince-Porteous, claimed he contacted the school to ask if his son could wear shorts, before being told his options were either full-length trousers or a skirt. Mr Vince-Porteous said: I was told shorts are not part of the uniform. It\u0027s a shame we can\u0027t be more grown up about it. We aren\u0027t asking for a rara skirt or skinny jeans, just tailored shorts for two months a year. It\u0027s not a big deal.

In August, Chiltern Edge Secondary School will become an Academy, meaning it can be governed more independently although remain state-funded. Their uniform policy change comes after the school was branded inadequate by Ofsted. Headteacher Moira Green said: In September 2017, with the support of parents, Chiltern Edge made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been a success. Maiden Erlegh Trust, in preparation for September 2018, wholeheartedly support Chiltern Edge’s adoption of a more formal uniform.

Parents appear to be making two big mistakes that are putting their kids at risk of serious injury - and both are easily avoidable.  Experts came up with the findings after inspecting children\u0027s car seats in more than 3,000 vehicles.  The What Car? study found that the most common errors related to the placement of seatbelts around a car seat, and headrests not being positioned properly.  The checks by experts from Child Seat Safety found that 36 per cent of car seats were incorrectly fitted to the car and 33 per cent of seats were not suitable for the children they were carrying. What Car? said the most common problems with car seats are simple and easy to avoid. More than two out of five (41 per cent) required the seatbelt to be rerouted, and an additional third (30 per cent) needed to adjust the headrest to ensure the seat was safe.  Almost two-thirds (59 per cent) of children are not as safe as they should be in their car seat, according to the study released as part of Child Safety Week. What Car? also found that more than 90 per cent of drivers using a large impact shield-style seat had correctly restrained the child, while only two thirds (61 per cent) of children were secure in a harness style seat. Isofix mounted seats had fewer problems with eight out of 10 (79 per cent) seats correctly fitted, while belted seats only protected 52 per cent of children. Children are legally required to use an appropriate restraint from birth until they are either 12-years-old or 135cm (4ft 4ins) tall.  But road safety practitioners such as Brake urge parents and s to use child car seats until the child is 150cm (almost 5ft) tall, regardless of age, as is the law in many other countries. Experts have encouraged parents to seek child seat fitting advice to make sure their children are restrained properly. Dave Adams, road safety officer with Avon and Somerset Police, which holds about nine child seat inspection days every year, said: “Each event helps around 150 parents ensure their children’s car seats are fitted correctly. “We know that the message is getting through to those whose child seats are checked, because it’s rare for the inspectors to find the same seat incorrectly fitted a second time. “The aim is to offer the e-learning course to other police forces so they can also use it to improve child seat safety in their areas.”  The force has implemented a system where drivers who fail an inspection are educated instead of being given a fine.  The driver is required to complete a 20-minute internet course on the Car Seat Smarter website to learn more about child car seat safety.  Claire Evans, What Car? consumer editor, said: “Ensuring a child is seated safely is vital for all parents but often many don’t realise the mistakes they are making. Taking simple steps such as checking the seatbelt is fitted tightly enough around the seat and making sure the seat is the right size for the child can go a long way to improving children’s safety. “We recommend anyone who transports children in car seats to seek expert fitting advice and ensure they try the seat in their car, ideally with their child in it, before they buy it.” Top 10 child car seat checks from What Car?  What Car? offers the following tips for parents:  1. Is your child too small for the seat? If you’re in any doubt, don’t move them to a bigger seat until you’ve sought the advice of a fitting expert. 2. If the seat is secured by the car seatbelt, check that it is not twisted and that it is fitted tightly enough around the child seat. It should be tight enough that the seat doesn’t move when you push it. 3. If your child has been wearing a bulky jacket during cold weather, the child seat harness may be too loose when he or she switches to wearing thinner clothes, so ensure that it’s still tight enough. To check this, try to pinch the harness in front of your child’s collarbone if you can get a good pinch of fabric between your fingers, it’s too loose. 4. If you’ve adjusted the seat’s head rest because your child has grown, ensure that the harness has been correctly routed back into place.

The 65-year-old shopper was contacted by a cold-caller who claimed to be from the HMRC and threatened her with jail if she didn\u0027t pay missed taxes immediately. He then asked the woman, who remains anonymous, to purchase hundreds of pounds of iTunes vouchers from the Tesco store on Victoria Street - but she was luckily stopped from going through with it by staff who recognised the scam. The woman said: I was absolutely terrified. He said that I owed the government money which I needed to pay immediately or I would be arrested. He warned me that if I didn\u0027t do what he said, I could be fined \u0026pound96,000 and we could lose our house or my husband\u0027s car. He told me that if I spoke to anyone on the way, I would also be arrested.  The woman went to the shop, but luckily staff at Tesco realised what was happening thanks to widespread publicity about the scam and called the police, reports Grimsby Live . The woman continued: They asked me what the vouchers were for, and I told them it was for my grandchildren. When they asked again, I burst out crying and told them what was really happening. The store called the police and the manager even spoke with the conman on the phone, telling him to leave the woman alone. Shockingly, she was the second person who had been targeted that day, and the scammer had asked for even more from the other victim, who was also prevented from making the purchase. The woman said the incident has left her shaken.  She added: I have asthma, and my chest has been tight all day since it happened. If I\u0027d had a heart condition, it could have been much, much worse. The police warned residents earlier this month about scams involving gift cards or iTunes vouchers. A statement from the force said: We have received a number of recent reports of fraudsters contacting victims via telephone and demanding payment by way of gift card or iTunes vouchers. A recent victim gave away over \u0026pound200 by purchasing iTunes vouchers and providing the codes to the suspect.

Debra Demetriou claims the blurry snap was taken when she was home alone and her house was locked. Taken from the foot of her bed, it shows her with her eyes half open and the covers tucked over her chin. The stay-at-home mum insists her Samsung S7 was under her pillow when she fell asleep, and it was still there when she woke up hours later, Chronicle Live reports.  Debra, from Benton, Newcastle, said she discovered the photo while scrolling through pictures from the night before. She said: “There was nobody else in the house at the time - I was completely freaked out. She said her oldest son left for work 45 minutes before the picture was taken, and her other son was with his dad. The house was locked, untouched from the night before, and there were no signs of a break in, she added.  Debra said: “I know you shouldn’t, but my phone had been under my pillow when I fell asleep. “It was still there the next morning. “I held down the picture to see the movement, and you can see both my arms are by my side so it couldn’t even have been a selfie. “And my eyes are half-open - if someone else had been in the room I’m sure I would have noticed them. “I’m absolutely convinced nobody else was in the house.”  The eerie snap has left her full of dread. She can’t stop thinking about who took it. Paranormal investigator Sammy Rawlinson has examined the image and admits it is “spooky”. The Stockton psychic added: “Spirits do things to get our attention. “If someone has passed in the last year it could be them trying to get her attention.”  Debra has lost both parents, but not that recently. However she admits this isn’t the first time something “strange” has happened to her. Pictures from her son’s last birthday contained, according to a clairvoyant, “ghosts” of deceased family members.

Graham Stuart Dillon carried out a brutal process of torture towards his nine-year-old son, Bradyn Dillon, before his death in 2016. The youngster was callously burnt with cigarettes, punched in the stomach and hurled against a wall in the months before he died. He was also bashed in the head, with the violence often punishment for a real or imagined infraction of discipline, court documents state.  Little Bradyn, from Australia, died in hospital after being knocked unconscious by Dillon during his final attack in February 2016.    A court previously heard the child was hit and kicked in the face, which is believed to have made his old injuries bleed, ABC reports.  Dillon, 40, who had carried out the beating after Bradyn allegedly stole lollies from him, left his son to lie unconscious for hours. Instead of calling the emergency services, the father went on the Internet and searched what to do if someone is knocked out. Finally, an ambulance was called to the home in Jacka, Canberra. Bradyn was taken to hospital, where he tragically later died. He had suffered more than 60 injuries to his head and body following months of violence by his father, according to court papers.  The court heard his death was caused by his aggregated brain injuries. Last year, Dillon pleaded guilty to murdering Bradyn.  And now, he has been sentenced to 36 years for the murder, with a further five years added for grievous bodily harm and assault charges including choking and threatening to kill, according to 9 News .  He was sentenced at the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, where details of his shocking crimes were read out.  Justice John Burns said the defendant\u0027s conduct towards his son could aptly be described as torture, The Canberra Times reports.

In a landmark ruling, the justices, in a 7-2 decision, faulted the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\u0027s handling of the claims brought against Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, saying it had showed a hostility to religion. The commission said Phillips violated the Colorado anti-discrimination law which bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012.  But the court did not issue a definitive ruling on the circumstances under which people can seek exemptions from anti-discrimination laws based on their religious views. After being rebuffed by Mr Phillips, Mullins and Craig filed discrimination charges with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, who ruled in their favour. The case went to the Colorado Court of Appeals, who also ruled in favour of the couple, but Mr Phillips pushed the Supreme Court to take his case, which they agreed to do last summer. The Supreme Court heard arguments last December and large crowds of protesters gathered outside in support of the couple. Two of the court’s four liberals, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, joined the five conservative justices in the ruling authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy.

It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent. The local government needs-based funding formula takes into account a number of factors such as rural and island communities, as well as road length and number of school pupils.\"A spokesman for the UK Treasury said: \"We\u0026rsquove helped make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved bodies in the world and they have a full range of tax powers to raise funds.\"Monday 4 Jun 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

for the public of the city centre landmark, which has undergone a multimillion-pound renovation.The hour-long tours would cost \u0026pound7 for adults and \u0026pound4 for children and are set to take place on Thursday afternoons, and possibly Tuesdays, and would run until the end of September.It follows a special doors open event which attract 3000 people to the Town House in February.Highland Council\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas and High Life Highland\u0027 (HLH) principal cultural manager Judi Menabney have outlined the proposal in a report for the local authority\u0027 city committee, which will decide whether to give it the green light on Thursday.\"From the outside alone the town house is acknowledged as the most visually impressive building in the city centre and the lavish interior within is a stunning example of Victorian opulence and swagger,\" the report stated.\"It is regarded by locals and visitors to the city as the jewel in Inverness\u0027 architectural crown, particularly since the stunning renovation work was completed this year.\"However, while loved by many, the town house is accessible to just a tiny minority. Providing guided tours would remedy this missed opportunity and provide a further new visitor attraction in the city centre with real \u0026lsquowow\u0026rsquo factor.\"A maximum of 12 places would be available for each tour, which would be led by staff from Inverness Castle Viewpoint and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery (IMAG). The \"modest scale\" will allow for \"fine tuning\" and an evaluation would be carried out before tourist season 2019.\"The limited capacity of the tours, coupled with the high staff to visitor ratio, mean the tours will never be a \u0026lsquomoney spinner\u0026rsquo,\" added the report.\"The primary driver for offering town house tours is not commercial in any case it is to add a third, uniquely \u0026lsquoInverness\u0026rsquo, visitor attraction to the city centre. IMAG, the castle viewpoint and the town house would thus create something of a \u0026lsquocultural triangle\u0026rsquo around Castle Wynd, which will provide an excellent precursor for the planned future major development of the castle and its environs.\"If every tour was fully booked, the council and HLH would receive just \u0026pound1000 profit each. However, to break even each tour would need to have, on average, a minimum of two adults and one child.It would be marketed through the IMAG and viewpoint as well as social media and leaflets for city hotels and B\u0026ampBs.Monday 4 Jun 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"040ex0406eea_story__1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tGraeme Shinnie says his first start for Scotland is something he’ll “never forget”.The Aberdeen captain won his second cap for Alex McLeish’s national side in the 1-0 loss to Mexico.That was the second game of the Dark Blues’ South American tour after Shinnie made his debut as a sub in Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat to Peru in Lima.The 26-year-old says making his first start for Scotland in the famous Azteca stadium was an unforgettable experience.He said: “It was a tough atmosphere against a good team in Mexico.“But it is an experience I will learn from and never forget.“The stadium and the atmosphere was unbelievable and the game was good, we were playing against some top, top players.“It was different experiences to learn from and it’s something I’ve enjoyed.“I’ve enjoyed the whole trip. I enjoyed Peru as well, it was brilliant and something that I’ll definitely learn from.”The Scots found it tough against the World Cup-bound Mexicans whose side contained the likes of ex-Barcelona and Tottenham player Giovani dos Santos, former Arsenal man Carlos Vela and Barcelona legend Rafael Marquez.The performance of Shinnie at left-back and Don Scott McKenna skippering the team in just his fourth cap were two positives.Shinnie added: “We were trying to keep our shape as best we could.“We knew that they would move and pass the ball about well so when we turned the ball over we were trying to keep it ourselves and get ourselves forward.“It was tough to do it, but when we did do it, especially second half, we had a good go.“We’re disappointed, Oli McBurnie has one off the post and we were desperate for it to go in.“But I think second half we definitely came into it more and got forward a lot more and created a lot more problems.”Conditions were gruelling with the stadium in Mexico City being 7,200 feet above sea level. Shinnie said: “It was tough, at one point in the first half I felt like I was swallowing sand.“It was good, it’s different experiences and it’s something that I’ll potentially never experience again.”Scotland boss Alex McLeish has been pleased with the trip to South America overall, despite the losses to both Peru and Mexico.The Gothenburg Great said: “The trip has been great, the players have been very professional.“Normally they would be on their holidays. We would love to be going to the World Cup the same as Mexico.“But we have played a couple of games that can help us build for the future.“It was a very tough game for us at altitude and in these conditions.“I think the players that we had out there did the country proud.“We are trying to get better on the technical side and we have asked the players to look at their game and be brave, to make passes and receive passes.“It’s a big part of the plan going forward.”One frustration for McLeish was Scotland’s lack of threat in attack.He added: “We looked to be more of a threat, to get players forward in the box. I felt that we never had the best of deliveries. When we got into wide areas, we hit the first man a lot when we had good presence in the box.“You saw when we got a good cross in the second half, McBurnie had a good header, he was unlucky he hit the post. In the first-half, we had crosses potentially for the strength of Callum Paterson but we didn’t quite succeed.“Both teams made changes, that can upset the rhythm of the game, but both teams did what they could to impress the fans and the coaches.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shinnie and mckenna earn pass marks for scotland as manager mcleish takes first strides on road to lifting hopes of a nation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen’s Scott McKenna captaining Scotland was one of the few highlights from their 1-0 loss to Mexico.The Dark Blues finished their South American tour with defeat in the famous Azteca Stadium with the only real positives being McKenna as skipper and another solid display from Dons captain Graeme Shinnie who played the whole game.The superiority of the World Cup-bound Mexicans was clear with the Scots only creating one clear-cut opportunity in what was a largely forgettable 90 minutes for the Tartan Army as they watched a team lacking in creativity.The merits of Scotland’s trip to South America at the end of a long season have to be questioned – but the tour has been a successful one for the Dons in Alex McLeish’s squad.Pittodrie skipper Shinnie has finally been given his opportunity and he has shown what many of us have known for a while: that he is capable of playing at international level.While McKenna’s fairy tale continues.The 21-year-old had already had a dream season breaking into the Aberdeen team and winning his first two caps for the national side in March.But on this trip McKenna has doubled his tally to four and has now captained Scotland.Gothenburg Great McLeish seems keen to build his defence going forward into the Uefa Nations League and the European Championship qualifiers around McKenna.He clearly has total confidence in the youngster and for McKenna to skipper the Dark Blues in just his fourth cap is an incredible achievement and he was one of Scotland’s best performers in what was a disappointing display.He is following in the footsteps of Aberdeen legends like Martin Buchan, Willie Miller, McLeish and Jim Leighton in captaining his country.Seven changes were made to the side which lost 2-0 to Peru in Lima last Wednesday morning.Jordan Archer, Charlie Mulgrew, Lewis Stevenson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, Jamie Murphy and Matt Philips dropped out.McLeish drafted in keeper Jon McLaughlin, Jack Hendry, Shinnie, Johnny Russell, Callum Paterson, former Dons loanee Ryan Christie and Oliver McBurnie to start.The changes were necessary due to the heat in the famous Azteca Stadium as well as the altitude, with the ground being 7,200 feet above sea level.But after only 13 minutes the Scots found themselves trailing.Edson Alvarez crossed from the right, Giovani dos Santos slipped the ball on to Carlos Vela just inside the area, he turned and Hendry’s slip allowed the former Arsenal man to square for Dos Santos who fired a low shot past McLaughlin from 18 yards with his left foot.The Scots were struggling to get the ball and string more than two passes together as the first period wore on.Former Aberdeen man Kenny McLean was the only player in Scotland’s midfield who seemed to have the confidence to try to keep possession and build attacks.Mexico could have doubled their lead just before the half hour when Miguel Layun’s 25-yard curler came back off the right post.McLaughlin made a decent save from Hirving Lozano’s long-range effort as the one-way traffic towards Scotland’s goal continued.At the start of the second period sub keeper Scott Bain made saves from Lozano and Hector Herrera in the opening 70 seconds.Then on 49 minutes McBurnie hit the right post with a powerful header from 10 yards after Russell crossed from the right.After not creating a chance in the first half this was more promising from the Scots.But on 53 minutes they were fortunate not to concede when Mexico broke at speed from a Scotland corner.At the end of the move Vela was free and could have shot but opted to cut back for Layun, but Shinnie and Bain smothered his effort.Scotland were given another let-off with 25 minutes left when Lozano blasted off the crossbar from 10 yards after getting away from sub Charlie Mulgrew.Sub Oribe Peralta had the ball in the Scots net with 18 minutes left but he was flagged offside.Despite Scotland’s best efforts in the closing stages they were unable to salvage a draw.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos

falsely claiming cash for hotel stays","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA nurse working at an Aberdeen hospital lied about doing a shift – and was caught out when a hotel told her colleague she had not stayed there.Lauren Hughes-Barr was working as a nurse for the Robinson Medical Recruitment agency in 2016 and 2017 and was occasionally based at Woodend Hospital.She was accused of claiming payment for work she never did, forging a signature and twice claiming to have stayed at hotels for work when she was actually elsewhere.The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) held a three-day hearing in Edinburgh on the matter, ending on May 25, and has now ruled Ms Hughes-Barr, who no longer works for the firm, will be suspended for three months.According to an NMC report, Ms Hughes-Barr filled in a timesheet claiming payment for work done on November 25 2016.According to the report, nurses sometimes need to stay in hotels when they are working far from home.Nurses pay for the hotel upfront and claim the money back.Ms Hughes-Barr was accused of submitting claims to the agency on December 20 2016 and January 3 2017 that she stayed at the Craighaar Hotel in Stoneywood, Aberdeen.According to the report, Ms Hughes-Barr told the NMC it was not a false claim, but a case of poor record keeping as she had stayed at the hotel but not kept receipts.It is not known how much money Ms Hughes-Barr attempted to claim and it is understood no NHS Grampian funds were lost as a result.The panel found all five allegations against Ms Hughes-Barr proved.Ms Hughes-Barr told the panel she had reflected on the incidents “every single day” while working as a nurse and had made every effort to ensure it will not happen again.Explaining its decision to suspend Ms Hughes-Barr, the panel said: “Behaving dishonesty on a number of occasions in order to gain financially fell far below the standards expected of a registered nurse.”A Robinson Medical Recruitment spokesman said: “Lauren Hughes-Barr is no

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Was that a bird\u0026#8230or something else? Just what might we find beyond the paths?The reserve’s new art trail, though, dials up the magic a notch.Just by the entrance, Jane Walker’s straw deer of willow and scraps greet the viewer. Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me. I see it as secret and unexpected treasure \u0026#8211 underwater kelp forests and ocean meadows gracefully riding the ebb and flow of the tides.’The influences of nature brought into a new light makes for a mysterious experience that will stay with you far longer than the trail can last.The art trail at Taynish National Nature Reserve runs until Sunday September 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.
