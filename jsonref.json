If you look at the odds, our risk is pretty low.\u0027         An employee sprays down the common areas of the Grand Princess cruise ship with disinfectant         Those being tested include passengers from the earlier Mexico voyage - on which the man who later died had travelled last month - who stayed on for the current Hawaii tripWright said the passengers - most of them between 60 and 90 years old - were in good spirits \u0027although that may change if we are stuck in our cabins for too long.\u0027 Health officials said it was unclear when or where the ship would be allowed to dock. Authorities raised the alarm after the 71-year-old California man who sailed on the ship in February died of coronavirus, becoming the state\u0027s first fatal case. Two other passengers from that voyage have been taken to hospital with the virus in California, while two Canadians who recently travelled on the ship have also tested positive after returning home. Officials say the dead man and another sick patient are likely to have contracted the virus while they were aboard the ocean liner. The second patient, from the San Francisco Bay area, was described by California governor Newsom as gravely sick.  However, the cruise line says there have been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the passengers currently on board the ship.  \u0027Public health officials have advised that no guests will be permitted to disembark until all results have been received,\u0027 it said. \u0027Out of an abundance of caution, all guests who have been identified for testing have been asked to remain in their staterooms.\u0027Overall, there are 3,533 people currently on board the Grand Princess, including 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew, of 54 nationalities. The majority of the guests - 2,016 of them - are US nationals. There are also ten American crew members. The ship off California was returning to San Francisco after visiting Hawaii. Some of the passengers remained on board after sailing on its previous voyage, to the Mexican ports of Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas.        The Grand Princess is currently 400 miles off San Francisco and heading for port having returned from Hawaii after 11 passengers and 10 crew reported symptoms of coronavirus          The number of cases rose above 96,000 worldwide with over 3,300 deaths in some 85 countries       Health authorities have had a suspicious eye on cruise ships in recent weeks after a number of voyages were disrupted by virus scares.In the most serious case, 705 people tested positive for the virus on board the Diamond Princess during a two-week lockdown in Japan.  Japanese authorities said last week that a British tourist who had been on board the Diamond Princess had died after contracting coronavirus.On Thursday, a patient with underlying health conditions became the first person in the UK to die after also testing positive for the virus. Separately, the cruise ship Westerdam was turned away at five ports last month before it finally arrived in the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville. There were no cases on board.  Several other ships have had their journeys disrupted by the virus after passengers required urgent tests or countries refused them permission to dock.  Experts have highlighted a number of reasons why cruise ships are vulnerable to the spread of disease, including the large number of elderly passengers in a confined space. There have also been fears that air-conditioning systems could spread the virus, with experts pointing out that ventilation systems were previously linked to the spread of SARS.  Some passengers have started to cancel cruise ship bookings or abandon plans to make them as the virus continues to spread around the world.  Cruise ships have also taken preventative measures themselves, with Royal Caribbean turning away guests with passports from China, Hong Kong and Macau and guarding against arrivals from Italy, Iran and South Korea.  "},{"url":null,"title":"NZ man coronavirus attended packed rock concert Auckland health authorities say","story":"Share this article The man and his partner had recently arrived back in the country from northern Italy.New Zealand so far has four confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, a much smaller number than Australia. In Australia, 60 cases have been recorded and two elderly people have died of complications from the virus.New Zealand has extended its travel restrictions for people arriving from China and Iran, in an effort to contain the outbreak of the virus.The virus emerged in China late last year and has now spread to more than 80 countries, leading to travel and other restrictions. It has killed more than 3,300 people and infected over 96,500.

The European commission stopped short of proposals to phase out combustion engine vehicles and has plans to consult on whether to include vehicles in its carbon-pricing scheme.Edward Collins, a director at InfluenceMap, said the document “represents yet another evidence piece” of ExxonMobil’s long-term strategy of delaying climate action by focusing on “long-term technical solutions” to try to avert “decisive regulatory action” that is urgently required to tackle the climate crisis.A  investigation last year found that Exxon has spent €37.2m (£32.4m) lobbying the EU since 2010, more than any other major oil company, according to the EU’s transparency register. It revealed that Shell spent €36.5m and BP spent €18.1m lobbying Brussels officials to shape EU climate policy.Exxon is also facing legal action in the US courts after accusations that it misled investors over the business risks caused by regulations aimed at addressing the climate crisis.The lawsuit claims that Exxon scientists told the company’s management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for increasing the levels of carbon in the atmosphere that lead to global heating. In 1981, an internal company memo warned that “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.Exxon’s latest lobbying efforts have surfaced after documents emerged earlier this year showing that BP successfully lobbied US policymakers to weaken a landmark environmental law to clear the way for fossil fuel projects to move forward.A spokesman for ExxonMobil said the company “complies fully” with the EU’s transparency rules and supports the Paris climate agreement. He added that Exxon, “like many companies”, had “a responsibility” to engage in a public policy dialogue that impacted its business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7026e2e38a631188a99f20a6e03d0d167157df5d/0_268_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51e5f812753974a06e4c8de367864624","title":"norwegian airlines shares plummet as coronavirus hammers travel sector","story":"Shares in Norwegian fell by more than a quarter on Friday amid investor fears over the airline’s resilience amid the coronavirus outbreak.The sell-off came as analysts warned that the airline’s cash reserves were slim.

The brand was bought by its Chinese franchise partner, Rebecca Feng, saving 21 stores, all the group’s concessions and 325 jobs. But more than 100 jobs lost with the closure of 15 stores.Patisserie Valerie: Had 200 cafes employing nearly 3,000 people when an accounting scandal prompted the chain to call in administrators in January 2019. About 70 of the group’s 200 stores closed immediately with the loss of 900 jobs. About 2,000 jobs were saved when about 100 Patisserie Valerie cafes were rescued by Causeway Capital, more than 20 of which have since closed. 21 Philpotts sandwich shops were bought by AF Blakemore \u0026amp Son. and four Baker \u0026amp Spice cafes a were bought by the Department of Coffee \u0026amp Social Affairs.Sarah ButlerThe crisis has made the calls for the reform of business rates – which will raise more than £8bn from retailers in the coming year – even more urgent. The commercial equivalent of council tax has been blamed for making a bad situation worse, with the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, expected to flesh out the Conservatives’ manifesto commitment to carry out a “fundamental review”.Tony Brown, the former chief executive of Beales, says the group’s punitive annual £2.8m business rate burden scuppered attempts to rescue the 23-store chain, which is now being closed down, leading to the loss of 1,000 jobs.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street,” said Brown, who explains that in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was 10 times as much as the rent, with councils unwilling to grant any concession. “The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy.”Retailers fear a review just kicks the can down the road when the industry is at a breaking point. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government looked at the issue in 2014 while the Treasury revisited it the following year. The government’s recent non-committal response to the Treasury select committee’s 2019 inquiry into the impact of business rates has also done little to inspire confidence.Business rates are calculated by multiplying a property’s rental value by the multiplier (the number of pence-per-pound of rateable value you need to pay in tax). Bills have risen steeply in recent years partly because the 2015 revaluation of property values was delayed until 2017. The multiplier has also risen from 34.8p in the pound back in 1990 to 51.2p this year for stores paying more that £51,000 in rent.Last month, more than 50 retail industry leaders, including the chief executives of M\u0026ampS, Boots and Debenhams, wrote to then chancellor Sajid Javid calling for action on business rates. With the Tories’ “levelling up” of the UK economy the order of the day, the letter, coordinated by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), claimed the business rates regime had effectively forced retailers outside London to subsidise those within the capital by £596m over the last three years. It added that retail had subsidised other industries by a net £543m over the same period.Retailers with premises facing sharp business rates rises after 2017’s revaluation, such as those based in London where rents have risen most sharply, could apply for upwards transition relief, which caps big annual bill increases after a revaluation by slowing rates rises.However, since the income generated by business rates will always add up to a fixed sum, set by the Treasury, upwards transition relief is funded by downward phasing. This is the slowing of the speed at which retailers with premises revalued at a lower business rate have their bills reduced.“The effect of this is to levy burdensome business rates on locations where demand is weak and rents are falling,” the letter said. These areas were often the most in need of levelling up with retailers in the north-west and Midlands effectively subsidising staggered bill increases in London, it said.John Webber, head of business rates at advisory firm Colliers International, says a review won’t change much if the government insists on raising the same amount of cash from the same companies (business rates will raise about £26bn this year).The 2017 revaluation hit big retailers particularly hard. They either experienced massive rates rises linked to historic high rents or, if their rates bills were due to fall, continued paying a higher rate because of the way downward phasing works. “This has kept rate bills in many poor parts of the country artificially high – something retailers can’t afford,” adds Webber.Critics of business rates argue they favour online retailers, which operate from cheaper out-of-town warehouses. Amazon’s business rates bill was just £63.4m in 2018, almost £40m less than Next. This is despite Amazon reporting UK sales of nearly £8.8bn – more than double that of Next, which has about 500 stores.The financial assistance schemes designed to smooth changes in bills meant struggling Beales essentially overpaid by £1.3m after the revaluation, which Brown said added to rising costs. “It’s not just business rates – although business rates was the key factor,” he says. “There’s the apprenticeship levy, pension contributions, minimum wage - all these things are making it impossible.”Real estate adviser Altus Group says Beale’s flagship store in Bournemouth should have been a big winner under the revaluation after its rental value fell by a fifth. However, the limit on reductions due to downward phasing meant it was effectively denied a £230,000 tax cut.Robert Hayton, its head of UK business rates, said abolishing these restrictions would put fairness back into the heart of the system. It was imperative, however, to continue to cap large increases as they acted “as an important shock absorber”, he added.With another business rates review on the cards retailers will be dusting off their submissions while hoping for a different outcome this time round. “Essentially we will be going over old ground with the tough questions having already been asked,” Hayton concludes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90185405b464236a43d6a147d746abbb4fe5abc/598_4_2757_1654/master/2757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40bcff00b40f513fb72c1425714b4fe9","title":"how small businesses can defeat the issue of late payments once and for all","story":"With some small tweaks, SMEs can better prepare themselves against the damage inflicted by late paymentsAfter one large online retailer paid Pietrasik late two seasons in a row, she decided to walk away and now prioritises small independent boutiques and her own website. “We’re focusing on staying strong and small,” she adds, “not needing to grow big and unstable. We grew very quickly and were stocked in all of the major department stores, but it didn’t necessarily mean larger or healthier profits.”And it’s not just big businesses taking advantage of their smaller suppliers, Torres says SMEs have a duty to pay each other on time, too: “Small business owners are busy people – and paying bills on time can often be a struggle. Paying a bill should be the first thing you do in the morning, whatever size business you are.”But it would be nice not to have to think about it at all, he adds. “My business isn’t chasing invoices.

The Democratic contender should take noteDespite being frail and confused, he won the trust of an oligarchic party nomenklatura in a declining superpower by promising no structural reforms, no curbs on special interests and no changes to an interventionist, hegemonic and overextended foreign policy.That’s a pretty neat summary of how the ailing Leonid Brezhnev held power in the USSR in the 1970s, or the ploy deployed by Konstantin Chernenko, the anybody-but-Gorbachev candidate, to become general secretary in 1984 before his death in office barely a year later. But the fact that it could also be read as an outline of Joe Biden’s pitch to the Democratic party establishment should give pause for thought.Think of this comparison, in true eastern European style, as a “serious joke”. First, excuse the silly part: there are leagues of difference between the intrigues of a totalitarian party state and the Democratic primaries. There were obviously no free and fair elections in the USSR. But there is a core similarity. The late Soviet Union was a complex system that the party establishment knew by the late 1960s was badly malfunctioning. Yet rather than rethink their role in the world or embrace what were considered radical structural reforms that would have threatened the vested interests of party chiefs and state corporations, the Soviet establishment chose an avoidance strategy – first with Brezhnev, then with Chernenko. The price they eventually paid, with the USSR’s collapse, was world-historic.This election cycle the Democratic party has been presented with not one but two compelling campaigns for structural reform in the shape of Elizabeth Warren (who dropped out on Thursday) and Bernie Sanders. Both candidates have offered a sustained critique of the country’s economic model and argued that it is to blame for the rise of Donald Trump at home and has fuelled authoritarian kleptocracy abroad. Their campaigns consistently highlighted the unsustainable nature of the current trajectory when it comes to not just the financialisation of the US economy, but the failed approaches to healthcare, college debt, climate breakdown and defence. And, issue by issue, the progressive diagnoses and treatments for these ills have shown themselves to be highly popular.Biden has effectively been the campaigner against structural reform: rather than articulating where he thinks the left flank’s analysis fails, he chooses to criticise their solutions as unworkable or unelectable. He was being honest when he told rich donors “nothing would fundamentally change” if he were elected president.But there is more to this than merely waiving proposed wealth taxes. Unlike the Obama administration, his would be a government with no policy roadmap, no reformist agenda and likely no executive energy. Biden’s visibly frail mind would be in the driving seat and, with it, his nostalgia for days of civility and collaborative politics on Capitol Hill that have plainly failed the Democrats for decades. There would be no rethink of the US’s role in the world, despite the country having spent $5.9tn on conflicts in the Middle East and Asia that have not demonstrably made it safer.Biden and his supporters’ desire to beat Donald Trump is laudable. He has clearly won the trust of African-American voters. But the fact that Biden has chosen to campaign for the presidency without presenting any goals beyond ejecting Trump should trouble us. By choosing to conceptualise Trump as an exception to the status quo and not as a product of the status quo, he fails to recognise that the conditions to produce another Trump still exist.Much of what is now attracting the Washington establishment to Biden is that he offers an image that resembles the mythic form of American leadership. But it lacks substance. What concerns me is that those in the Beltway establishment most committed to the so-called “rules-based international order” that Trump has undermined are forgetting that American power is built on a foundation of widely shared domestic prosperity allowing social stability.However when lower- and middle-class incomes have been stagnant for decades, nearly 140 million adults report “medical financial hardship” every year, life expectancy is in decline as personal, mortgage and college debt continues to rise, this foundation starts to crumble. Surveys show the national sense of wellbeing has declined. Key indicators like these were what the Soviet leadership chose to ignore when they decided they would rather retain Brezhnev in senility or choose Chernenko months away from death than confront the challenge of domestic reform.This is where this “serious joke” gets really serious. Biden – if he survives the media- and Republican-led onslaught that will highlight every agonising mental blank as closely as Hillary Clinton’s emails – could actually win in November. Head to head polls in swing states show this electability. But those now rushing to endorse him have to be honest themselves about what kind of presidency this will be – a kind of caretaker government that will swear fealty to superpower myths, and ignore the immense structural problems hollowing out the nation’s strength from within because they are too hard.• Ben Judah is the author of This is London and Fragile Empire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1431e30db093df4c1f0a5d02a78392bcabcac290/0_134_3722_2233/master/3722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bebed49c0c5eb28754f5ef5f954d4b49","title":"coronavirus plan new york stockpile","story":"As of Thursday morning there were 11 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York state (population: 20 million) and the phony war against the virus was well under way. In the city, people tried to find a proportionate response while honouring the need to be Doing Something. This mostly took the form of using an elbow to activate the elevator and finding somewhere to store 25lb of rice. Plus, of course, wondering if now was the time to buy Apple stock.Other questions remain. Does it make sense to cancel your spring break in Cancún when you pass through Times Square every day? How do you disinfect a phone? Are we supposed to be washing our hands multiple times even when we haven’t left our apartments? Does eating turmeric really work? And the big one: how much guilt should I feel for enjoying a massive sense of relief when a bunch of things I didn’t want to go to were cancelled?The real fear was – and is – the schools closing, but with the exception of some of the private schools in the city, which sent home notes advising parents to prepare themselves for the imminent possibility of a switch to teaching online – the disruption would be so vast that it seems unlikely. But while the Department of Education implores parents to respond to “facts not fear”, it could be hard to distinguish one from the other. The biggest threat to the city is irrational consumer behaviour, but it is also possible to wince at the cavalier attitude – even one’s own – that mocks it.Meanwhile, the thing we all said to each other was “people are losing their minds”. In my own building, the Dad’s Army-like response of the management committee was to put out a statement reassuring us that the front desk staff had washed its hands and cancelling an in-house meeting of the co-op board. Anyone in a uniform was appealed to as a source of authority. A friend downtown reported a conversation between her doorman and neighbour, who was soliciting him for advice on whether it was OK to touch a package that had been sent from China.Problems with hoarding became apparent, not just in the supermarket but also in what happened once you got home. Like eating your packed lunch at 9.30am on the bus on the day of a school trip, we all ordered mountains of dried apricots and then sat watching alarmist reports on television while compulsively eating them. So much for stockpiling.When concerned parents at the school gate asked each other “how are you doing?”, it was with enough wryness to acknowledge we were being ridiculous, while hoping we were activating the reverse jinx effect that by being prepared we could prevent something happening. A friend’s doctor on the Upper East Side, meanwhile, predicted “pandemonium” when the virus really takes off in Manhattan and it turns into the island equivalent of the Diamond Princess.Still, nothing happened. I thought about those history lessons at school where we learned about the folly of London parents who, after evacuating their kids to the countryside in the early stages of the second world war, brought them back to the city because no bombs had dropped. Then I turned on the TV and opened another packet of apricots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce255f2558a9a84b56a09390018204e150fffd4/0_126_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cff8b6be9a80744a9138b4101e42ca7","title":"flybe business coronavirus travel sector","story":"Other high-profile casualties that rely on the travel sector may follow – but smaller businesses will take the biggest hitAs the infection and death toll from coronavirus continues to creep higher, sending ripples of panic through communities and financial markets, the first high-profile corporate casualties are starting to emerge.Flybe, Europe’s largest independent regional airline, collapsed into administration this week, putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk immediately and imperilling the future of a host of regional airports and local economies. It will take months – even years – to gauge the full extent of the fallout.In truth, it wasn’t just coronavirus that brought Flybe down – but a plunge in travel demand in reaction to the outbreak was the final gust of wind that flattened a precariously balanced house of cards.Intense competition, debilitating taxes and a fares war with regional rival Loganair bruised Flybe even before a massive Brexit-induced slump in the pound dealt a body blow. In January the government extended a lifeline to the beleaguered carrier, but against the backdrop of Covid-19 that package became untenable.Airlines in general have endured severe turbulence in recent years. Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel firm, collapsed in September, triggering the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history. Now the International Air Transport Association estimates the potential financial cost of coronavirus for airlines to amount to between $63bn and $113bn this year. Last month it had pinned that figure at just $29bn. British Airways, easyJet, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and Norwegian Air are just some of those that have already warned about the financial impact of coronavirus. Hotel chains, cafes and restaurants are the next obvious corporate victims. Huge events and conferences, such as the Geneva Motor Show and Basel watch fair, have already been shelved. Facebook’s massive developers’ conference due to take place in May in San Jose, California, is off, too. InterContinental Hotels, which owns Holiday Inn, has been forced to close 170 of its 470 hotels in the critical Chinese market. As of Friday morning, shares in the company had lost a fifth of their value over the last month.Global stock market indices have suffered their worst drops since the 2008 financial crisis over the last fortnight. What’s also important to remember, though, is that as far as markets are concerned, the higher you’ve climbed, the further you can fall. Late last year, global stock indices were hitting record highs. So while the equity tumble looks extremely dramatic, it’s also likely to be symptomatic of an overvalued market. When overvaluation occurs, many investors will use any excuse to sell.So what happens next? Will the Bank of England cut interest rates? The outgoing governor, Mark Carney, this week implied that it’s certainly an option. And – after years of speculating about the extent of the financial impact of Brexit – will it actually be coronavirus that tips us over the precipice and into a recession? The next few weeks will tell.Ever since the beginning of trade, economies have moved in cycles, pushed and pulled by a rotating array of geopolitical, commercial, social and cultural forces. Occasionally we get what statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb termed “black swans”: rare and unpredictable events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations. Even though some sort of pandemic was always going to happen eventually, to my mind the precise circumstances surrounding coronavirus make it such a beast, but in history we’ve overcome worse. This won’t spell the end of humanity and it won’t knock the UK economy out cold. Companies may be battered, bruised or – in Flybe’s case – broken, but for the majority this, too, will pass.What perhaps won’t pass as easily, is if, in an effort to keep the shop running, a business develops a bad reputation. In an era of leaders parading governance strategies that put profit and purpose on par, this is their opportunity to prove what they’re really made of: honour employees, safeguard their rights, consider their needs and respect their expectations.

Anglers still remember catching them. We’re hopeful that recent work to improve water quality and to restore habitat has brought our rivers back to a good enough state to support England’s great lost fish.”The burbot, also known as the eelpout and the lingcod, disappeared at the same time as the otter vanished from waterways. In both cases, agricultural and heavy metal pollution may have played a role.Tosney said the cause of the burbot’s disappearance remained “a bit of a mystery” but was a combination of pressures including the disappearance of natural “messy” edges to rivers, including pools, flooded areas and back channels.“People did used to eat them but it’s more likely to be water quality and habitat quality slowly degrading since the second world war that caused their disappearance,” he said.The burbot, the only freshwater species of cod, once thrived at the bottom of cool lowland rivers across eastern England but leaves its preferred habitat for ponds and pools to spawn and so requires pools and other freshwater close to the river.Burbot could also be a beneficiary of beaver reintroductions, as the beavers create burbot-friendly habitat.The fish has been successfully reintroduced into Belgium and Germany, and Tosney said there were several river valleys in the East Anglian Fens with good floodplains that could be ideal habitat.Before the fish is brought back there will be further feasibility studies and also an environmental DNA survey to check there are no traces of burbot DNA in rivers, which would prove that a few survivors have evaded detection since the 1960s.The Norfolk Rivers Trust hopes to raise £80,000 to fund a five-year reintroduction pilot. Because of the high mortality rate for young fish, hundreds of thousands of young burbot will be first reared in captivity from eggs brought from European hatcheries.Dave Ottewell, a fish specialist for Natural England, said: “Over recent years great efforts have been made to restore our freshwater environment, rectifying some of the historic damage inflicted on these valuable and complex systems.“This work has focused on rebuilding the natural processes that underpin high quality freshwater habitats. It is the successful restoration of these habitats that has led us to a position where we can now realistically look towards the reintroduction of this recently lost species back into its native range.”The reintroduction may worry trout fishermen in particular because the omnivorous burbot will eat trout.“They eat pretty much everything – invertebrates, other fish, and trout, no doubt about it, but trout will also eat burbot,” said Tosney. “Anglers do not like predators but I can’t see any other reason to object – it’s a native species, it should be here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/158fd9d3b3778f8c14e044cb2d5d58e56aae5fb2/0_0_1920_2400/master/1920.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1fdb56021cb55d4461367b9d8dda603b 1400w","title":"cinema coronavirus projected 5bn loss","story":"Blockbuster releases remain largely on track, as do plans for the Cannes film festival but unease increases behind the scenesA spokesperson for Cineworld, which owns multiplexes throughout Europe as well as UK arthouse chain Picturehouse Cinemas, pointed to the fact that most releases remain on track, with studios apparently reluctant to change schedules unless it becomes absolutely necessary.“Admissions remain high,” Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK cinema association told the . “In line with the advice given by the deputy chief medical officer this week, all sites will remain open,” he said.A similar defiance was demonstrated by the Cannes film festival, which said it remained committed to proceeding as planned in mid-May.On Thursday, the French government extended a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of May.“It’s a confidence thing,” one industry source added. “You can’t start saying you’re worried. It has to be very on until it’s suddenly very off. In part, that’s just a legal and insurance thing.”More than 12,000 delegates attended Cannes last year, but the largest cinema at the Palais des Festivals seats only 2,300. Invitations to the Cannes lineup press conference in Paris on 16 April were sent out on Friday morning.Cannes regained credibility as a launchpad when three of its 2019 premieres – Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire – performed well during awards season.This followed a couple of underpowered editions for the festival in which its programme was overshadowed by Cannes film festival director Thierry Frémaux’s row with Netflix, whose films he barred from awards eligibility.Pressure on festival directors not to skip a year would therefore be considerable, despite both unsettling government advice and increasing industry precedent.On 4 March, organisers of the Cannes MIPTV content market – which also takes place in the Palais – announced they were cancelling this year. Forty of France’s cinemas have been closed and the number of confirmed cases in the Cannes area has reached double figures.More than half of Italy’s cinemas are closed and regulations prohibit people from sitting less than a metre away from each other in public.Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the national association of exhibitors, has unveiled a system he hopes would comply and enable cinemas to remain open: allowing the booking of every third seat in a row, with empty seats directly in front and behind.Lorini said his team had been “working round the clock” to try to make the plan viable.On Friday the International Indian Film Academy Awards were postponed because of “sensitivity” over the mounting health crisis. Originally due to take place on 27 March, the annual gala is Bollywood’s version of the Oscars.The inaugural Red Sea international film festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was cancelled earlier in the week, and increasing numbers of attendants – including Amazon and Apple – have withdrawn from the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. SXSW has a significant film sidebar, and is still scheduled to take place for 10 days from 13 March.But it is the mainstream end of the film industry which is likely to be hit hardest by the spread of coronavirus, while smaller films and streaming sites such as Netflix could be set for an unexpected boost.MGM’s decision to delay the release of the Bond film was applauded by many, despite a potential $50m bill to cover logistics – as well as costs and share falls for the many sponsors whose tie-in campaigns have already begun.In earmarking an alternative window quickly, the studio has bought dominance over a key date in the cinema-going calendar – No Time to Die opens in the US over Thanksgiving weekend – while the seven-month hiatus allows time to redraw plans.“That feels like a safe amount of breathing room,” said a source close to the production. “Tentpole movies live or die on large audiences going out of their houses and watching them in cinemas with hundreds of other people. Right now, nobody wants to do that.”“In China infections seem to have peaked but you can’t see them opening cinemas before June,” said another industry insider, “nor people being keen to go for a while after that. Add three months for the rest of the world and November starts looking very attractive.”Widespread cinema closures across China, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan and South Korea have already done drastic damage to the global box office, with one consulting firm suggesting that the loss during China’s new year holiday alone amounts to around $1bn.Among projected big-hitters yet to be released in China’s 70,000 screens are Dolittle, Sonic the Hedgehog and Oscar contenders such as 1917, Marriage Story, Jojo Rabbit and Little Women. When cinemas do reopen, the backlog will cause further delays and local titles will be prioritised.Bond’s distributors did not directly mention coronavirus in their Wednesday statement, instead saying that the decision had been taken after “careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace”.Two-thirds of the money made by Bond movies comes from outside the US, with east Asia increasingly courted by Hollywood producers.Forthcoming blockbusters such as Mulan – whose $200m budget makes it Disney’s most expensive live-action remake yet – and the ninth Fast and Furious film are highly reliant on Asian markets for their profits.The Chinese premiere of Mulan was cancelled some weeks ago and updates are anticipated from Disney on any changes to the worldwide launch, which is currently still scheduled for 27 March.Early estimates suggest that Mulan’s US opening weekend may still manage a $90m take, with some crediting coronavirus’s reportedly less dramatic impact on children as one reason that family films may not suffer as much as their adult counterparts.How Mulan fares will have substantial implications for the strategy surrounding Disney’s first blockbuster of the year: Avengers spin-off Black Widow, which is meant to open worldwide at the start of May.Should these films flop, many forecast a domino effect as studios scramble to reschedule tentpole releases. F9, Scooby-Doo movie Scoob!, Wonder Woman 1984 and Netflix’s Eurovision movie are all early summer releases whose release dates look vulnerable.Production disruption is already considerable, with Paramount halting a planned shoot in Venice on Mission: Impossible VII last week citing “concerns of the crew”.“Who is going to underwrite a movie which goes into production next week?” queried one source. “If an actor is due on set in say, late March, their agent might well forbid them from working, saying it’s too dangerous.”Nervousness was demonstrated by talent agency CAA on Wednesday when it clamped down on anything other than virtual meetings. The same day, Sony Pictures’ offices in London, Paris and Poland were shut for the remainder of the week after a UK employee was feared to have been exposed to the virus while travelling abroad.Paramount is, however, pressing ahead with the release of the sequel A Quiet Place Part II on 20 March. Just a 10th of the original film’s $340m take came from China the curious parallels between the plot – a family self-isolates to try to survive – perhaps boosting its box office appeal among populations relatively unaffected by illness.Contingency plans for mid-range releases may involve fast-tracking them to streaming services, where there is likely to be a substantial appetite from a captive at-home audience.Water-cooler titles such as Promising Young Woman – in which Carey Mulligan feigns drunkenness on nights out before taking bloody revenge on men who attempt to take advantage of her – are thought to be prime candidates for films that could do well online, if a cinema release appears optimistic.However, legacy inertia could make such innovation challenging. “The ecosystem of release strategies would be really damaged by that kind of thing,” said one source. “Everything is booked and lined up already. I don’t know if that tactic has real financial merit.”The industry’s structural makeup may also prove problematic, with studios and exhibitors prizing competition over collaboration, meaning strategy communication is limited.“It’s uncharted territory,” said one source, “but that also means there are lots of opportunities out there if streamers can move quickly.”Representatives for Netflix and Amazon did not respond to the ’s requests for comment, but a boom in users and dwell time over the coming weeks appears likely.Even long-established studios are seeing silver linings online. Contagion, Steven Soderbergh’s unfortunately prescient 2011 thriller about the global outbreak of a deadly virus, has proved such a viral hit over recent weeks that it’s already Warner Bros’ second-best-performing film of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0087589375aca97c9d204fff55d1da57c0631e94/0_369_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f410071f3654e1aade5cf731786886","title":"greg kinnear on misbehaviour and metoo where were human resources in the 1990s","story":"The actor is America’s Mr Nice Guy. So what drew him to play an out-of-touch Bob Hope in the Miss World protest movie?Can I ask you something?” says Greg Kinnear, slightly nervously, toward the end of our conversation. “Did you notice that I’m wearing a prosthetic nose?”He is not talking about right now – he is on the other end of the line in a hotel room in British Columbia, so he could be sporting nothing but clogs for all I know – but rather how he appears in the new film Misbehaviour. In this British comedy-drama about the Women’s Liberation Movement protests that disrupted the 1970 Miss World event, he plays the US entertainer Bob Hope, who hosted the pageant that year and made no secret of his disdain for the idea of gender equality. A month earlier, the comic had appeared in a TV special, Bob Hope Looks at Women’s Lib, in which he imagined how different the TV networks would be if they were run by women: no televised sport but the offices would be spotless.I tell Kinnear that I hadn’t noticed anything up with his schnoz after a few minutes of the showbiz smugness, the slight squint and the right hand pressed flat against his body as though slipping inside an invisible pocket, it is possible to see him as Hope, despite the disparity in age (Kinnear is 56, while Hope was a creaky-looking 67 in footage from the event).“Well, you sure know how to warm a guy’s heart,” he says. “But I’m worried about it. I said to my wife, ‘Is the nose too subtle?’ Because I think people are going to be asking: ‘What’s happened to Kinnear’s nose? Has he been drinking?’” It’s hardly Nicole Kidman in The Hours, I tell him. “Right. For her, it was like: ‘Oh my gosh, look at the nose!’ It was all anyone talked about. And here I am, my first interview out of the gate, and you’re saying: ‘I didn’t even know you were wearing one.’”Kinnear may have been acting for a quarter of a century, but he still has the joshing, laid-back bonhomie that made him such an effective television presenter, just the right side of snarky and smarmy – first on Talk Soup, an irreverent Clive James-style roundup of eccentric cable-TV clips from the early 1990s, and then as a chatshow host on Later with Greg Kinnear.“We went out in the wee small hours,” he recalls, “when you get your smokers and tokers.” It was from here that he was plucked by Sydney Pollack to star opposite Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in a remake of Billy Wilder’s Sabrina, which led to his Oscar-nominated performance in As Good As It Gets as the gay artist forced to fall on the mercy of his misanthropic, bigoted neighbour, played by Jack Nicholson. Playing Hope in Misbehaviour brought him back full circle to the sort of entertainer he used to be. Even before Kinnear’s TV career took off, he hosted a weekly hour-long show on Armed Forces Radio in his teens (as the son of a diplomat, he lived in Athens and Beirut before returning to the US to finish his education) on which he would, he tells me, “fill the hour with mindless talking and music.” While he has yet to acquire national-treasure status, there are certainly similarities between his career path and Hope’s. “It all began in radio for him, too, and that led to TV and a huge career at NBC – the same network where I worked – as well as movies. His job was so obviously a big part of who he was, part of his soul, even.” But as Kinnear is only too aware, Hope does not emerge from Misbehaviour with dignity. “We have a guy here living in a different era, which, when held up in today’s light and where we’re at, it does look, uh, slightly off.”The film makes no secret of Hope’s infidelities even before the feminist campaigners (Keira Knightley and Jessie Buckley among them) are pelting him with flour, his wife Dolores (Lesley Manville) is bracing herself for a repeat of the personal Miss World humiliation of a decade earlier, when he returned from his hosting gig with the winning contestant in tow. And that was only the mistress she knew about. His agent, Louis Shurr, once told a publicist: “Our mission in life is to keep all news about fucking and sucking away from Dolores.”“I wasn’t so familiar with that side of him,” Kinnear says, “but I thought this was an interesting aspect of the movie. You’re taking this beauty contest, this event that was so commonplace and accepted, you know – ‘This is what we do, people.’ And to bring that up in 2020, it’s like I can’t think of anything that signals more clearly the cultural changes and shifts that have occurred, even just in the past few years. I tried to find the reality of who he was in that day and age and what he was there to do – to be that smiling, winking guy with these bathing-suit-clad beauties. And I think the movie shows that the times were changing around him, and he was caught off-guard by that.”Does he think a persona such as Hope’s can be a straitjacket? “Well, you either change with the times or you don’t. And you can see he was very flat-footed in that moment and he doesn’t quite understand it. You see that situation all the time now and maybe in a more accelerated way in our current environment. It does show that progress is being made, whether or not we’re ready for it.”Kinnear, who is in the middle of shooting a nine-part television adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand, says that film sets are a very different place to be now. “The other day someone said: ‘Oh yeah, human resources are on set today.’ You know, a person who’s there to make sure people are feeling safe and following the rules and aren’t being compromised by someone who’s doing shit they shouldn’t be doing.’ And I thought: ‘Wow, where were human resources back in the 1990s?’”Even setting aside the infidelities and his sexism, Hope is a prime candidate for “cancel culture”, which seeks to strike from the record the achievements of anyone whose moral and behavioural standards fall far below our 21st-century expectations. In the 1980s, for instance, Hope was using homophobic slurs and cracking Aids jokes. Kinnear asks me for a quick definition of cancel culture but it’s evident immediately that its principles are at odds with what he as an actor relishes in a role. “A person’s imperfections are always part of the great work of studying any character, showing all sides and finding the truth. Even the most noble, regal character still has flaws. For me, it’s a case-by-case basis. Egregious behaviour, where someone should have known better – well, I’m not sure you can write that off as: ‘Hey, the times were different!’ But I do think also there are many examples of behaviour where you can say: ‘Listen, this was a time when things were different and it’s unfair and ridiculous and pointless to some degree to pretend that their contribution was not meaningful.’”There is a line that Kinnear delivers in As Good As It Gets that sums up the sentiment: “If you look at a person for long enough, you can see their humanity.” He practically trills when I mention it. “I love that line and I’m so glad you’re citing it. It’s true. There is always something to be discovered if you give it time.” To Kill a Mockingbird is much on his mind at the moment – he takes over from Ed Harris as Atticus Finch next month in Aaron Sorkin’s sellout Broadway adaptation – and he invokes that character here also. “Atticus says that you can’t really get to know a person until you get inside their skin and crawl around.”As a father of three daughters aged between 10 and 16, he is keenly aware of the male bias in the movies that are greenlit. “It’s like turning an aircraft carrier around. It’s very slow. And you do feel that the inherent maleness of showbusiness for so many years is reflected in the vast majority of stories that get told. Misbehaviour I look at as a really entertaining story but it also has a strong female voice that I love and it isn’t told like a two-hour civics lesson. It’s just honest and powerful and it makes a dad of three daughters feel good.”Will he show them the movie? “Oh my gosh, yes. The oldest one wants to take it to show at her school. In general, they are not particularly keen on watching anything that wasn’t made in the last four-to-seven minutes. For them, if a song didn’t drop in the last 15 hours, then it’s old.” I have to point out, though, that he said “drop” rather than “come out.” “How about that? They’re gonna be so proud of me. That’s the most contemporary term I’ve used in the past seven years.” The air of the bumbling dad is endearing. “I don’t do any social media and they are always telling me I don’t have much of an online footprint. They’re just used to me being a goofball.”His self-effacing nature, and those smiley, sad-eyed features, worked a treat in the likes of As Good As It Gets, Little Miss Sunshine and Ira Sachs’s heartbreaking Little Men. But his trustworthy image has also been used to subversive effect, such as in Paul Schrader’s disturbing Auto Focus, in which he played another beloved Bob – in that case, Bob Crane, the star of the US sitcom Hogan’s Heroes, who happened also to be a sex addict with a compulsion to film himself in the act. “Yes, well, that was a slight shift for me there,” he concedes. “I love that film. I was really surprised I got tapped to play the guy. But I didn’t think: ‘How are people gonna perceive me?’ It was just a damn good story. I try not to be too persona-oriented. Some actors are good at knowing where their sweet spot is and, for the rest of us, it’s a work in progress. I still have the excitement in my career of not knowing what the next page will be.”• Misbehaviour is released in the UK on 13 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7f10cc8e1b230c629b2b2aedb0cd8c91528ceb0/0_161_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffd51bc272ca82c57eb38f9f40ff278f","title":"how to eat supermarket sandwiches","story":"This month, How to Eat is digesting a variety of supermarket sandwiches. Which flavours work? Which combos tank? And is it sensible to eat the same one every single day?Forty years ago this spring, the supermarket sandwich was born. Despite a deeply unappetising start (M\u0026ampS’s debut salmon and tomato filling reads like a dire omen), the packaged sandwich proved irresistible. Today, it is a £5.6bn-a-year industry that dominates the to-go lunch market.Yet bizarrely, given the scale of that penetration, the subject of this month’s How to Eat is rarely discussed in detail. Perhaps that is the insidious genius of what Sam Knight brilliantly christened “the sandwich-industrial complex”. It so neatly fulfils a need in time-poor late-capitalist societies that we meekly accept it without objection.If it is impossible to see a future without the supermarket sandwich – its convenience is often invaluable – there is nonetheless a case to be made that Britain should wean itself off its sandwich habit and try to make its own lunch more often. The industrial sandwich market is a huge culprit in creating unrecyclable food packaging waste and, it is calculated, the same CO2 annually as 8.6m cars. If not for the planet, act to save yourself a few quid, rather than accepting supermarket sandwiches as an inescapable, functional necessity.Could the way forward be to eat fewer supermarket sandwiches but get more out of them when we do? In that case, How to Eat (HTE) – the series exploring how best to enjoy our most popular foods – has a plan.It is difficult to believe Dominic Raab could be right about anything. He is a man to ruin rather than capture the public mood. But, in 2018, when it was revealed our foreign secretary eats the same lunch every day – a Pret chicken caesar baguette – many will have nodded in knowing approval. In repeated surveys, as many as one in eight of us have confessed (is this anything to feel guilty about?) to eating the same lunch every day. For years and years.A more generous reading of that predictability is that supermarket sandwiches are almost universally terrible. Why experiment, when from routine disappointment at Boots to Waitrose’s frequent woeful inability to fulfil your expectations, most store-bought sangers are hangers, misery encased in malted granary. We have all found the nearest store, its least worst sandwich, a tolerable filling, and will hang in there until it shuts. We cling to Nurse for fear of something worse.HTE is convinced that each supermarket is only capable of producing (sorry, sourcing from a huge sandwich manufacturer), one truly good sandwich at any one time. Finding that sandwich is fraught. You have been stung. You do not want to try new things. But, occasionally, a filling presents itself that, in terms of offering savoury depth, acidic poke, moistness and textural heft, is clearly going to operate at a higher level. It will actually deliver discernible flavour straight from the chiller cabinet.Even if you only ever eat these sandwiches in an emergency, it is useful to know that the top three currently on sale in Britain are:1. Sainsbury’s ham hock and mature cheddar, £3 Juicy hock and a genuinely beery, fruity ale chutney dovetail nicely with the cheddar, and simultaneously ensure a refreshing moistness.2. M\u0026ampS New York deli pastrami, £3.30 M\u0026ampS used to do a posher, better, bagged version, but this combo of pickles, sauerkraut and peppery pastrami still delivers relative bang for your buck.3. Waitrose Heston from … salt beef pretzel sub, £3.60 The lone star in the inky blackness of Waitrose’s sandwich range. But grab a really fresh one or that pretzel sub is like chewing through the arm of a sofa.It is crucial to have a mental road map in place that, in the absence of the rare examples above, will help you navigate this gastronomically barren terrain.The list of generally reliable fillings is short. For instance, egg mayo (andor cress), triple cheese or tuna mayo and cucumber are all familiar nursery flavours that withstand the rigours of the chiller cabinet reasonably well (eg, sliced cucumber stays crisp). Smoked ham and cheese is similarly difficult to ruin entirely. And while it may be hard in 2020 to justify regularly eating the beef they traditionally accompany, any sandwich that contains pickles, sauerkraut or mustard will usually deliver some flavour. Look out for rye bread, too, for an additional layer of interest.Anything involving salad should be avoided (it inevitably delivers zero flavour), while, conversely, attempts to inject va-va-voom using a pickle, stuffing or chutney should be approached with extreme caution. Not only are such components poor when mass-produced, they are unavoidably prominent in sandwiches, the dominant flavour usually. That can be ruinous if they clang with your palate.Two perennially popular and appalling sandwiches worthy of special mention are the all-day breakfast and the BLT. Serving cold, leathery bacon in any circumstances should be a criminal offence. Worked into the general all-day breakfast slurry, it is particularly awful. Note: experts have concluded that the all-day breakfast sandwich has the largest carbon footprint of any sandwich, equal to driving 12 miles. That justifies a two-mile detour to buy a tastier, greener lunch (a salad, say, from M\u0026ampS’s Plant Kitchen range).As for the BLT, can there be a convenience product that has travelled so far from its original conception? The still-warm, toasted BLT, full of newly fried streaky bacon, thick with mayo and properly seasoned, room-temperature lettuce and tomatoes, can be wonderful. The drab, cold supermarket version (the volatile compounds that give tomatoes their flavour chilled into inertia), is more a deliberate provocation, a faint echo of the original just recognisable enough to make you acutely aware of the pleasure you are being denied.Oh … and never eat any supermarket sandwich described as low-calorie.In short, the struggle against under- and meanly filled sandwiches is real. Yet, having settled on a flavour, HTE has found no easy way to judge the sandwiches on the shelf against one another, to find the fullest. You can try the pinch test (gently squeezing the cartons to gauge plumpness), while some swear by examining the cut ends of sandwiches to find those that look as if they have a thicker filling. But in HTE’s experience neither test is particularly reliable, another reason to avoid supermarket sandwiches. That surge of resentment on opening a dramatically underfilled one is an unhealthy emotion.This is difficult, given they are usually eaten in transit, away from home. But most supermarket sandwiches benefit from a (filling-dependent) extra layer of salt’n’vinegar or ready-salted crisps. It adds the seasoning and textural contrast so many manufacturers neglect. Additional pickled gherkins, homemade coleslaw or mayo can also elevate a mundane supermarket sandwich into the heady realms of acceptable.HTE has a rule that, when eating outdoors, cold weather requires hot food (soup, pasty, pies etc), and vice versa in summer. In winter, on your lunch hour, it is possible to sit in a freezing, windy shopping precinct and feel you are stealing precious me-time back from The Man if you have hot, warming food in your hands. In contrast, speed-eating a cold sandwich on a cold bench on a grey Tuesday in March is likely to trigger a full existential crisis about the cosmic unfairness of the nine to five.Better to flee back to the warmth of the office or save that sandwich for the bus or train where you will at least be able to feel your own fingers. But please remember that, on public transport, folding your sandwich carton flat and stuffing it down the side of the seat is (second only to leaving the box and half-eaten crusts on the seat) an absolute no-no.While gourmet sandwich restaurants blaze a trail for the adoption of the sandwich as an evening meal, the push by high-street sandwich slingers to conquer “the evening day part” feels like a fait accompli. Dreary as it may feel at 7pm or 10pm, in frenetic, time-warped, overworked 21st-century Britain, we increasingly find ourselves relying on the supermarket chiller cabinet. You may find that sad. You may find that liberating. But it would require a radical restructuring of society to alter that reality, not merely some inspirational recipes for better homemade lunches.Pop of some description. That is a lot of malted granary to masticate. You need fizz and that extra hose pressure to swill your mouth out.So, supermarket sandwiches, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a67349515afffd044038ffdf4ae083a5cfd5a842/0_138_2763_1658/master/2763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1465fbc3ca31bd722cc3e557636da97","title":"lauren hemp gives lionesses hope with feisty performance against usa","story":"The 19-year-old shone despite England’s 2-0 defeat in their SheBelieves Cup opener and says once she’d beaten Kelley O’Hara ‘you want to do it again’If there were hopes England would have the bit between their teeth in their first match of the year, they were short-lived. Yes, the Lionesses held out against the world champions for longer than most, but a ramshackle performance lacking structure, accuracy and ideas in their 2-0 defeat by the US at the SheBelieves Cup meant Phil Neville’s team picked up where they left off before the winter pause.It was not all negative though. The much-anticipated first start of Lauren Hemp provided cause for optimism. In the 19-year-old Manchester City forward Neville has a player who did not look out of place going toe-to-toe, head-to-head or shoulder-to-shoulder with the strong and powerful Americans. In fact, there was almost an air of the steely unbeatable resolve of the four-times World Cup winners about Hemp.Up against one of the best right-backs in the world in Kelley O’Hara Hemp more than held her own and not long after kick-off found herself well and truly under the skin of an initally frustrated Rose Lavelle, a World Cup final goalscorer.The tussle with O’Hara in particular was fun for Hemp. “I really enjoyed it,” she said. “The referee wasn’t on our side at times and I gave away a few fouls that were 50-50. But I really enjoyed playing against her. I grew in confidence as the game went on – once I got the beating of her I got more comfortable. Once you beat her once you want to do it again.”It worked. With England’s full-backs run ragged by Christen Press and Tobin Heath, Hemp offered a smidgeon of relief when she got on the ball.“It was surreal for me,” Hemp said of the step up to top-level international football. “That’s probably the biggest game I’ve played in. Standing out there during that national anthem with all the fireworks going off, it was the moment where I was like: ‘Wow, this is what international football is really like.’ I’d love to be in more occasions like that and be one of the stars.”With England struggling to find fluidity and form and the pressure ramping up it could be perceived as a tough time to enter the fray. Hemp, though, said it was “possibly the best time to come in”.She added: “As a young player you have no fear, no pressure and just do what you can to help the team. It’s obviously a new group of players, there’s young people coming in like myself and it’s hard to gel when you’ve only been together a few days. I’ve only been in a few camps myself but I think we’re still training hard and working hard to improve every day and it’s just sad we couldn’t get the result we wanted.”Without taking anything away from the standout performance of Hemp, there has to be a concern that England’s best player, in a testing match against the world champions, was a teenager making her fourth appearance and first start.England’s senior players need to match the fight and ambition of the new crop snapping at their heels, otherwise there is an argument to say Neville should make more wholesale changes and look to the generation below to restore much-needed fearlessness and confidence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c7995c6c417f1b09693fe27a9242748dced32b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67be1be8ab22fb1db7c3349ed51ef46b","title":"norwich won the championship why are they 19 points off sheffield united","story":"Promoted teams meet on Saturday and a difference in transfer spending is not the whole story behind their ergent pathsProgress in the FA Cup apart, when Norwich City travel to Bramall Lane on Saturday the conversation among both sets of supporters will share a common theme. How come a club that won the Championship by five points last season are bottom of the Premier League, while the side that finished runners-up lord it over them, 19 points better off and, given that Sheffield United have a game in hand on most around them, still hopeful of reaching Europe?The obvious answer is money. The Blades broke their transfer record four times between gaining promotion and playing their first fixture back in the top flight, while the Canaries spent next to nothing. It would appear you get what you pay for in football, though that is by no means the whole story. Even though the only Premier League club in Yorkshire dominated the local headlines over the summer, spending money while rivals such as Leeds, Wednesday and Huddersfield kept their powder dry, the extent of the outlay only came to a shade over £40m.Admittedly that is extravagant investment compared with the £4m or so Norwich spent, though it is nothing remarkable by prevailing Premier League standards. Norwich seem to be attempting to follow the Burnley model of gaining a foothold in the top ision anyway. It might not be possible to put down permanent roots in a single season, so it is not necessarily a good idea to go out on a financial limb the minute promotion is achieved. Relegation need not be calamitous as long as you can still live within your means, especially if you are able to retain the manager and keep the same core of players together.Although very few clubs other than Burnley spent as little as Norwich last summer – although perhaps significantly one of them was Liverpool – Sheffield United’s £40m outlay did not make them the ision’s biggest splashers of cash. Far from it many bigger clubs paid out more than twice as much and United were not even the most conspicuous spenders among the three promoted clubs.Aston Villa, who came up through the play-offs, immediately set about restructuring their entire side, keeping Jack Grealish but bringing in virtually a fresh set of players to play alongside him at a cost variously estimated at between £110m and £140m. But Villa’s reward for keeping pace with Manchester City and Manchester United in the transfer market is currently a place in the bottom three. Villa too have a game in hand on immediate rivals as a result of playing in the Carabao Cup final, but even if they win it they are likely to be worried about survival for the rest of the season.Some of their performances have been impressive, others much less so, and it was interesting that Tyrone Mings suggested last week that trying to bed in so many players at the same time might be a clue to their inconsistency. Villa have unquestionably been unlucky with injuries to key players such as Wesley and Tom Heaton, but the point Mings was making was that many of the new intake are new to the Premier League as well, at least as regular performers. “Half a dozen or more of us are learning on the job,” the defender said. “We have to learn quickly.”Norwich have the same problem. Their players may be familiar with each other but most are new to the Premier League, and though they managed to beat Manchester City back in September they have found the overall standard in the top flight a challenge most weeks.Sheffield United, on the other hand, are thriving, despite bringing in a clutch of players in summer and a couple more in January. They have reached the traditionally significant total of 40 points, and though Europe may prove a stretch, both in terms of finishing high enough in the table and buying more players to bulk out the squad if necessary, they are definitely not going to be relegated.Credit must go to Chris Wilder for his acuity in the transfer market, therefore, for apart from picking up Phil Jagielka on a free United did not go for established Premier League names or prominent overseas talent. Their team even now does not contain many players with vast Premier League experience, though you would never know that from watching them.They broke their transfer record again in January to bring in the Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge from Genk, though that was in the knowledge they had made a solid start in their new ision. They have done so without plunging themselves into unmanageable debt too, for Wilder is proud of spending just the money their rise in status allows. Perfectly appropriately given the club nickname and the industry for which Sheffield is famous, the Blades have proved themselves steely competitors. Not naive or soft-centred, but sharp and resilient from day one.Very few newly promoted teams in recent years have managed to find the magic formula quite as quickly, and Norwich’s and Aston Villa’s ergent paths but similar experiences would suggest Sheffield United are the exception rather than the rule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/377caeb70215dbeaa26e52374c0b0c95d81081ab/0_150_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=926ad3046873ad3116e7dc5a2bef85cc","title":"steve clarke in scotland sweep sectarianism under the carpet euro 2020 play offs mourinho","story":"Scotland head coach on Euro 2020 play-offs, being Mourinho’s No 2 and why he checked his bank balance before becoming a managerSteve Clarke speaks with an occasional undertone of menace that suggests he could have starred on an alternative career path. It is easy to envisage the 56-year-old immersed in a Glasgow crime drama.This is not to suggest Clarke is not cut out for his chosen environment. An icy exterior – sometimes, perhaps, put on for effect – is useful in his line of work. The Scotland manager is not boastful about the iniduals he has worked alongside but a list that includes Glenn Hoddle, Gianluca Vialli, José Mourinho, Kenny Dalglish, Frank Lampard and Ruud Gullit emphasises his status.Should Clarke take Scotland to Euro 2020 via the play-offs those in his homeland may hold him in loftier esteem than that sextet combined. Israel on 26 March, then potentially Norway or Serbia, lie between the Scots and a first finals appearance since 1998.“I knew the magnitude of these games and in a strange way that was one of the draws,” he says of being coaxed from Kilmarnock last summer. “It was an attraction because this is a good opportunity but listen, Israel, Norway and Serbia will all be saying the same thing.“The public are a bit disillusioned with the national team. I don’t want to say that’s nothing to do with me but that’s from previous years. I’m reasonably new in this job. It’s important neither myself nor this squad of players take in that it’s been 22 years of doom and gloom. We have to see this as our chance, do our best and not worry about what has gone before.”It is fitting to glance back through Clarke’s fascinating journey, a rugged defender for whom missing out on Scotland’s trip to the 1990 World Cup hurt. “I went in the pre-squad in February, to Italy. I was in the 26 or 28 but dropped out of contention between then and the tournament. It was disappointing to be so close.”Clarke was a Chelsea fixture 10 years before the financial revolution at Stamford Bridge, his last appearance a winning one at right-back in the 1998 Cup Winners’ Cup final. Vialli floated the idea of a player-coach role. “That suggested he was going to bring someone else in to play in my position,” Clarke says. “I wasn’t too happy.”Chelsea would have demanded a fee if Clarke moved to Newcastle with Gullit as a player so he hung up his boots and took a coaching role at St James’ Park. A switch back to Chelsea involved youth-team duties before José Mourinho took a shine to Clarke and hired him as his first assistant in England in 2004. “I think he just wanted someone who knew the club, the league,” Clarke says, somewhat bashfully. “Right place, right time.”He adds: “José was a breath of fresh air for the Premier League. He was great for the players. I liked his enthusiasm, his intensity. His training was really structured. He didn’t have a great deal of time for fitness coaches and measurements, he just put on training sessions the players enjoyed.“We had a great three years together. In football you tend to drift away and on to the next job you bump into someone after two or three years and it’s the same as seeing them yesterday. It’s a little bit like that with José. We had text messages, eventually that dried up, then he has been away working all around the world. He isn’t going to be that bothered about whether or not I’m keeping in touch. We were really tight knit when we worked together.”Clarke had the chance to remain at Chelsea after Mourinho departed. The appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari in 2008 was instead the precursor to Clarke’s second Chelsea exit. “I could have stayed. That would have been the easy option. I wasn’t comfortable at being the perennial No 2. That didn’t fulfil my ambition. I wanted to put myself under pressure.”Still, it took until 2012 for Clarke to step into management at West Brom after coaching roles at West Ham and Liverpool. Typically, there was method to that approach. “You know when you take a manager’s job it could be terminal. I was making sure there was enough in the bank to cover that, making sure myself and my family would be all right when I took the plunge. That’s not to say if the chance had come up earlier I wouldn’t have done it. I knew I was ready.”Clarke took West Brom to their highest Premier League finish and points total before a “strange ending” that included being placed on gardening leave. “For the first time in 18 months we lost four in a row and the chairman was obviously nervous. His club, his choice. I can be pleased with my work there.”Clarke took Reading to the FA Cup semi-finals and coached alongside Roberto Di Matteo at Aston Villa. Management might have passed him by before the umpteenth call from Kilmarnock in October 2017. Clarke’s brother Paul played more than 400 times for the club. Steve left Scotland – and St Mirren – at 23.Clarke was branded a miracle worker at Kilmarnock, dragging them from the perennial threat of relegation to a third-place Scottish Premiership finish in the 2018-19 season.“Kilmarnock had been on the phone a few times over the years,” he says. “I’d decided I was finished. I was happy working on my golf and doing a bit of fishing. My wife started nagging that I needed to go and work again. Everything just clicked.”Everything within his control. Clarke made headlines across Britain last February after vehemently criticising sectarian abuse from Rangers supporters during a defeat at Ibrox. A year on he is candid when asked whether the landscape has improved. “I don’t think it has,” he says. “I had been so far out of it and came back – for me it was very clear.“I always put it on the line as the racism one: if you call someone a black bastard, that’s not good if you call them a fenian bastard or an orange bastard, that’s all right. What’s the difference? It exists in society but it manifests itself in football grounds. I don’t understand it.“There was obviously an amount of frustration on the night … It’s pretty normal that you get an outburst then everything just quietens down, people sweep it under the carpet and it goes away again. That is how they deal with sectarianism here in Scotland.”The Scotland manager’s job should carry a health warning. Alex McLeish used it as a platform to move to Birmingham 13 years ago, but he is the clear exception to an inauspicious rule. Manager after manager has seen prospects reduced as Scotland struggled.“You could have said that same about Kilmarnock because if I’d gone there and it hadn’t gone particularly well, I probably wouldn’t have got another job,” Clarke says. “So it’s not really any different here. I’ve gone in with my eyes wide open. I didn’t think this was a job I could turn down.“If it doesn’t work out, you are looking at a contract until 2022 and hopefully, everything being as it should be, no matter what happens with these games I’ll get the time to build and shape the squad over a number of camps that can get us a qualification.”Clarke has sampled changing attitudes towards international football. “I didn’t earn fortunes but the pinnacle was always to be capped by your country,” he says. “Now I think the pinnacle is securing the next contract.”Pending coronavirus developments, Israel’s visit on 25 March should see Hampden Park at, or close to, capacity. “When I bump into Scotland supporters they are pretty positive. They just want a little bit of success. I don’t think that’s too much for them to ask.”Woe betide any fan who believes Israel will offer a free pass to Oslo or Belgrade. “If I was the Israel manager I’d be looking at how competitive they were against Scotland in their last two games,” Clarke says. “Israel are dangerous, their front players are top-level. I’ll be delighted if we get through that one.”He might even show it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cafaf3fa901fb11fa8b5b5175f4733be9198dc98/0_66_2337_1401/master/2337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49fd51897907e2a5ac278a8906c81bad","title":"the fiver handshakes coronavirus premier league","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Eager to be seen to be doing something to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, however useless it might be, the Premier League and Football League have decided to dispense with the “Fair Play handshake” between players and match officials until further notice. Despite obvious concerns that the absence of these mandatory, utterly insincere and tokenistic pre-match pleasantries, introduced 16 years ago for reasons that still remain unclear, could result in a nationwide pandemic of “unfair play”, the two governing bodies are pressing ahead with an anti-social initiative that will be severely tested during Sunday’s Manchester derby at Old Trafford.Asked if he was concerned about the likelihood of trouble at the game, after United midfielder Fred was hit by a missile thrown from the stands during the closing stages of their win at the Etihad in December, Pep was more circumspect. “We have to try to behave good as managers and professionals and then as supporters,” he tooted, as mobile phone footage of cerebrally challenged knuckleheads – who’d taken time out of their evening to wait by the United team coach and relentlessly eff and jeff at Jesse Lingard, while also appearing to racially abuse the midfielder, following his side’s FA Cup win at Derby County – circulated on assorted social media disgraces.While it remains unclear whether the troglodytes in question are home or away fans, United are understood to be furious that their player was subjected to such appalling brickbats. They plan to enlist the help of both the Rams and local constabulary in a bid to identify the culprits, who are hopefully trembling with fear in their parents’ spare bedroom as they contemplate whatever unpleasantness is about to be visited upon them. You don’t need to be a virologist to know that washing their filthy pottymouth mouths out with soap and water might not halt the spread of such toxic abuse, but it might help to slow it down.“Following unacceptable behaviour of the Ultras supporters group over a number of games this season we have taken the decision to ban this group from home games. They will be able to gain entry inidually if accompanied by a parent” – as pay-offs on club statements go, this from Fort William is quite the zinger.The latest Football Weekly Extra podcast is right here.

I like how he stands up for his family, for himself, and you know we all get criticism and we have to take it in different ways.“There have been many events recently where they haven’t taken it well but footballers and football managers have to get it regularly. I know Eric well as he was with me at Everton, he is a great boy. Really good professional from a really good sporting family and background who understands all the issues in sport.”Eddie Howe said that, while Dier’s post-match reaction was unfortunate and regrettable, the behaviour of some football fans needs to be subjected to more scrutiny. “It is very easy to focus on the reaction of the player, and I don’t think anybody wants to see players, coaches or anybody confronting supporters in that way,” the Bournemouth boss said. “But the world of football needs to look at what is said and what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. It is almost anything that is said from the terraces: ‘Oh, that is just football banter, that is the world of football’, but I don’t think it should be like that.“I think it is an opportunity to look at this and maybe review what is acceptable and what is not, highlighting it for everybody who goes to games.”Tottenham’s investigation of the incident is on hold until politan Police finish their own enquiries, while the Football Association will also wait to see the outcome before acting.Blackburn Rovers taking no risks regarding coronavirus. Blackburn Rovers have issued a statement saying they will be obeying the EFL diktat banning pre-match “Fair Play” handshakes, but are going further in their efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In addition to the Government advice, Rovers have opted to implement additional precautions at Ewood Park, as well as the club’s Senior Training Centre and Academy – and we have advised our players and coaching staff not to shake hands, sign autographs or pose for photos with supporters before or after games – in order to help mitigate the risk of the virus spreading further,” they say.“We apologise for any inconvenience caused, but hope that supporters understand the reasons behind these measures being taken. Additionally, any supporter who has recently returned from an affected country should seek professional medical advice before travelling to any upcoming Rovers fixtures.” Harry Maguire is “touch and go” to feature in Sunday’s Manchester derby.Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says centre-back Harry Maguire may not be ready to face Manchester City on Sunday.The United captain missed Thursday’s FA Cup win at Derby after rolling his ankle in training on the eve of the game and will be assessed ahead of the match.Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James have not trained this week with knocks so will also need checking over.

It’s not ideal. I don’t know the financial situations of other clubs but I would say it would be very detrimental to the financial well-being.“I think we are maybe getting a little bit too far ahead of ourselves at the minute and we will have to take it week by week. Yes, we want to play the games and obviously we want to play them in front of full houses, that’s what football is all about. Behind closed doors isn’t ideal and, like I say, the club will guide me on how to guide the players and staff on that.”Barça coach Quique Setién echoed Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp widely-shared response to a request for his opinion on how football will deal with coronavirus.Klopp won plaudits after carpeting the journalist who asked the question, asking how the words of those with no specialist medical knowledge were of any value during a health crisis.Setién said: “I think he gave an extraordinary answer. The reality is that I have dedicated my life to football and so has he. I don’t know what value my opinion has when I know nothing about this situation.“There are much more competent people out there who can talk about this issue, it’s as if people want to know everything but I don’t understand these questions. I guess people feel they have to ask something.”Well that’s this liveblog of football manager responses to questions about coronavirus told. Eesh. Probably as well that Barry’s returned to take the reins back here. Daniel Farke this week enjoyed back-to-back wins for the first time this season, at home to high-flying Leicester and away in the Cup for the spot-kick success at Spurs.Speaking as he prepares his side to face fellow promoted side Sheffield United, he said: “Success is no coincidence. Even when the odds are against you there is no reason to give up. We will keep going and try to make something extraordinary.”“We are realistic and know we are bottom of the league. We have to earn the right to play here next season, so we are not carried away. I don’t want to stop the feelgood factor we have, but I don’t see any danger of us being over confident or losing the ground beneath our feet.”Speaking of the derby, this from Jamie Jackson has just landed …Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City will on Sunday face an “incredibly aggressive” Manchester United enjoying their best moment of the season.Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team are unbeaten in nine matches, a best run for a year. The trip to Old Trafford will be City’s fourth meeting with their crosstown rivals this term, having lost two of the previous three.Ole Gunnar Solskjær has been harrumphing at the fixture list. He’s unhappy that his side had to play in the Cup last night and then strap up their aching bones for the derby on Sunday, while rivals City got an extra days’ rest.He said: “It’s that help we get from the FA again, the extra 24 hours that they’ve had … I cannot believe there’s a derby on Sunday and we’ve got to play on Thursday night. What’s the point in that? That doesn’t level the playing field.Jamie Vardy is closing on a return for Leicester in Monday night’s match against Aston Villa.Having missed the defeat to Norwich and Wednesday FA Cup win over Birmingham, the forward “looked very good in training and he’s still on track for Monday”, according to Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers added: “He’s a very important player for the club and has been for a number of years, particularly since I arrived here. It’s very important he’s available for us for this final part of the season.”Full-back Ben Chilwell is more of a doubt, however, with the club monitoring “a hamstring twinge”.Roy Hodgson has been talking about his one-year contract extension (see 11.09), and said securing his backroom colleagues’ future at Crystal Palace was the “crucial factor” in re-signing.He said: “I’m very pleased. We talked about it for quite a long time … It was more a case of making sure everyone around me is going to be looked after as well, and receive new contracts, because you don’t work in isolation at a football club. You’re very dependent upon the people you’re working with, and I happen to think we have a very, very good team who work with the players and prepare the games.“That was a crucial factor for me. People can’t give you assurances and guarantees, but everyone at the club – Steve Parish and the American owners – we’re all pretty much aware of the fact it would be nice to have some investment in the team and to strengthen in certain areas. That’s what we’ll be trying to do.”John McGinn is closing on a return for Aston Villa after suffering a fractured ankle late last year. The midfielder’s fine early-season performances caught the eye but in his absence Villa have won only two of nine games in the league and now find themselves second from bottom.“Once he gets on that training ground he’ll move quickly and he’s certainly progressing quickly now. Obviously, there will be a lot of pressure put on him because of the pressure on him before his injury, but we have to make sure he’s right when he actually comes back.”West Ham’s manager has responded to Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin’s suggestion that the League Cup be scrapped with an alternative.David Moyes said: “I’ve always thought we should have included Scotland. I think it could do with a revamp, maybe there’s a way that then a certain amount of Premier League teams wouldn’t enter.“I understand the fixture pile-up and there are an awful lot of games for the top players … a lot who will be playing in the Euros and just off the back of playing long seasons, Saturday-Wednesday, and are then expected to start again in the Premier League with only two or three weeks’ break, so I don’t think that’s correct. The players are going to have no time off at all.“It’s in need of some way of being revamped. Call it the British Cup. A couple of teams from Northern Ireland, maybe two of the Welsh League clubs.”Here’s Andy Hunter’s full story on Liverpool’s goalkeeping gah …“Unfortunately Ali is out,” Klopp said. “He had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game. We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway the plan was he was on the bench.More on Chelsea’s injuries. Willian feels Mateo Kovacic’s achilles pain and requires a late fitness test. Jorginho starts a two-match league suspension after racking up 10 yellows this season, while N’Golo Kanté still has adductor ouch and Tammy Abraham’s ankle knack continues.Lampard said: “It hasn’t been spoken about that much, but we’ve had probably the worst injury list of certainly the top group of the table I think, lots of numbers injured, important players injured, Kanté, Loftus-Cheek etc.”However Lampard added that Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic played in an “in-house game” at Chelsea’s training ground earlier today: “It was great to see Christian get some minutes, he’s still short of match fitness, but it’s the first time the injury’s gone up to a level to get him on a big pitch in a relatively competitive match, so it’s a big step forward hopefully. Ruben played half of that game himself, and is trying to find match fitness.”Dominic Calvert-Lewin is just a pen, paper and photographer away from committing more of his life to Everton, says Carlo Ancelotti. The club this week nailed down defender Mason Holgate on a five-year deal, and the Italian said: “Holgate is going to be the future of this club. It’s important for him and for us to renew the contract, to have stability here with this player.“We are close to Dominic Calvert-Lewin also and I hope he’s going to sign soon. The idea for the future is really clear for us.”“The players follow him – the commitment they have – and it’s getting better,” he said. “Right now maybe is the best moment in the season there … I always have a great opinion and a good respect for Man United.”Our first few match previews are in for tomorrow’s matches …Frank Lampard has been asked about coronavirus things, and how it could affect how Chelsea approach the rest of the season, starting with Everton on Sunday …“It wouldn’t affect anything in terms of preparation – you would take on the opposition in front of you. Obviously it would affect the atmosphere, clearly. It obviously takes a lot away from the game when you don’t have fans in the stadium. There are some things that are more important, and if that’s the path that’s chosen by the authorities then you would go with that.”Lampard is injury-hit, with up to nine players out, after Callum Hudson-Odoi suffered a recurrence of his hamstring twang on his return to full training. Mateo Kovacic is also sidelined with an achilles problem.Afternoon all. Just emptied a tin of Vim over Mr Glendenning’s workstation, but straight off the bat there’s this just in from Spurs, in follow-up to this from earlier … Dier will play against Burnley tomorrow.José Mourinho, when asked if the versatile midfielder would feature, said: “Of course, the only thing that matters is nothing really big happened and secondly he played so, so well. Of course he is going to play. The only thing I can say is that if I see something happen to my son I would do the same. I would think two seconds about doing the same.”In further keeper news, Hugo Lloris is a mild doubt for tomorrow’s game but is expected to play.Important handover news: Stuart Goodwin will be taking over for an hour or so. Please be gentle with him. Liverpool news: Andy Hunter is at Jurgen Klopp’s press conference and brings reasonably good tidings from the Liverpool manager. Fitba: Interested in seeing what happened when a famously dour, occasionally belligerent, crotchety and temperamental Scotsman sat down to interview the manager of his national football team? Ewan Murray sat down with Steve Clarke so you could find out ... Fitba: Steven Gerrard admits he is facing one of his most difficult periods in football - but says that challenging himself was exactly why he opted to begin his managerial career with Rangers.After advancing to the last 16 of the Europa League by beating Braga over two legs, his side has lost twice in five days - their Scottish Cup exit against Hearts followed by a home defeat by Hamilton.“The whole 20 months has been challenging but of course when results are not good enough in a short space of time there’s more heat and more pressure on myself, which I accept,” he said, when asked if this was the most challenging week of his professional career.“In many ways, yeah, it probably has been challenging but even when we were winning, this job is challenging because you have got to do everything you can to continue that. This is one of the most challenging jobs out there. I knew that and it hasn’t disappointed.”Meanwhile in Barcelona: Over in La Liga, Barcelona have the chance to regain top spot on Saturday night when they host Real Sociedad at Camp Nou. But in the buildup to the match their manager, Quique Setien, has been bogged down by chatter about the behaviour of his assistant Eder Sarabia, who has made headlines with his language during Barca’s 2-0 defeat by Real Madrid. Setien has since apologised to his Barcelona squad. For a sample of effing and jeffing in question, click here.Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur: James Tarkowski has rejected the suggestion Burnley’s chances of recording yet another clean sheet when Tottenham visit Turf Moor this weekend will be easier in the absence of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.The frontline pair are both injured and will miss Spurs’ trip to the north-west at teatime on Saturday as they look to arrest a slump that has seen them lose ground on the Premier League top-four.Burnley could leapfrog them with a win following a six-match unbeaten run that has carried them into the top half of the table, in part thanks to the effectiveness of their back-line. On 11 occasions this season, Burnley’s opponents have drawn a blank in front of goal, but Tarkowski is not taking another clean sheet for granted.“Yes and no!” said Tarkowski, upon being asked if now was a good time to be playing Tottenham. “Maybe there’s more expectation on us because they are missing two of their big hitters.“When they are missing Harry and Son then obviously there may be a chance there for us to put a good performance in. I don’t think it makes easier. Maybe from your perspective it does but not for me, no.“There is still a player in front of me I have got to stop from scoring goals and there is a team of 11 players we have got to go and beat.”Tarkowski, fellow centre-half Ben Mee and goalkeeper Nick Pope have started every match in the top-flight this term, bolstering the impression that familiarity has bred success. “We’ve had quite a consistent back four this season which is nice,” he said. “The full-backs have chopped and changed a little bit but me, Ben and Popey have been there all season and that sort of consistency helps. It sort of comes more natural with each other, we know each other’s game, I expect where Ben is going to be and he expects where I am going to be at times and we cover round each other.”More on that Jesse Lingard abuse: As we mentioned earlier, Manchester United have launched an investigation into the shocking abuse aimed at Jesse Lingard following Thursday’s FA Cup fifth-round victory at Derby.The 27-year-old was among six changes made for the 3-0 win against his former club at Pride Park, where video emerged on social media showing the midfielder being abused as he made his way onto the team coach.Lingard is heard being sworn at repeatedly as he signs autographs, before boarding the coach as another fan shouts “zero goals and zero assists”. United team-mate Luke Shaw confronts supporters from the doorway of the bus and what appears to be a racist remark is allegedly uttered by someone waiting outside the coach.You can see and hear the footage below, but please be advised that it is not safe for work and contains lots of loud “effing” and “jeffing”, as well as other depressingly unsavoury and unimaginative, possibly racist abuse.Some massive games in the Championship this weekend too. Yorkshire derby, Fulham away to Bristol City and Charlton Boro at the bottom. As a partial follower of Leeds I think this weekend is massive. If they can win their next two they should be able to build a cushion that can take the pressure off. Problem is historically they\u0027ve always slipped up when on the verge of pulling away from the chasing pack and home against relegation strugglers are Leeds\u0027 particular favourite bottle job. They just cannot deal with teams who play with men behind the ball. If Fulham can get the win and Leeds do drop points it blows the race wide open but if they drop points and Leeds can find a way of farting the ball into the goal one more time than Huddersfield and West Brom don\u0027t slip up against a Swansea side who\u0027ve gone off the boil at the worst possible time, Fulham will have start thinking about the prospect of another foray into the playoffs with Brentford up next.The fair play handshake... Never has a more meaningless phrase ever been uttered in the context of football.Covid-19 aside, an enforced handshake or one out of habit is an empty gesture that diminishes both fair play and handshakes.Sheffield United v Norwich City: Two of the three promoted teams meet on Saturday and a difference in transfer spending is not the whole story behind their ergent paths, writes Paul Wilson.Brighton news: Brighton boss Graham Potter intends to take it one match at a time as his team prepare for a daunting run of fixtures which could decide their Premier League fate.This weekend’s trip to sixth-placed Wolves being followed by successive matches against Arsenal, Manchester United, Norwich, Liverpool and Manchester City. It is a formidable challenge awaiting the south-coast side, but Potter prefers not to look too far ahead or worry about what could happen elsewhere.“We have to focus on ourselves and not think about external things too much. You can’t look any further than the next game, otherwise you overthink,” Potter said. “Rather than worrying about what might or might not happen we will make sure our attention is on our game.”Potter knows just what a tough ask it will be to leave Molineux with a good result. “They have done amazingly well and full credit has to go to the manager for getting them promoted and then stable in the Premier League,” he said. “Wolves have been on a good European run and maintained their level. They are well organised and are competing for a top-four spot.

Matchday operations at EFL grounds are set to continue this weekend with Clubs being advised to take appropriate prevention measures as per the Government guidance. “It is understood, however, that inidual Clubs may take decisions at a local level to help mitigate the risk of the virus spreading further ahead of this weekend’s matches.“The EFL continues to remain in regular dialogue with the Government regarding the ongoing developments and is being appraised on a regular basis of developments that could potentially impact our Clubs and Competitions“We will continue to provide EFL Clubs with updates and advice as it is issued to ensure that they have all the relevant up-to date information so that they can continue to advise their players, staff and supporters.“These matters are subject to constant change and we will update as appropriate.”Coronavirus update: The Football League is to follow the Premier League in banning pre-match handshakes between sets of players in a bid to halt the spread of the virus. As gestures go, it could scarcely be more pointless, but it does at least allow both governing bodies to be seen to be doing something.Neither the Premier League nor the EFL have mentioned if they will also be forbidding players from spitting, blowing their noses, screaming in each other’s faces. For the time being at least, they will also allow tens of thousands of spectators to sit together in close proximity to each other and the pitch, coughing, sneezing and shouting.Coronavirus is spread via droplets from the nose and mouth and can be transmitted on to the hands and passed on via a handshake.Coronavirus update: Denmark has become the latest country to announce that all football matches will be played behind closed doors for the rest of March. The country has also banned events that involve gatherings of over 1,000 people.All sport in Italy, including Serie A games, will be played behind closed doors until 3 April in an effort to contain the disease, the government has said.Manchester United news: The club have condemned what appears to be racist abuse suffered by Jesse Lingard after Thursday’s FA Cup win at Pride Park, and will contact Derby for help in investigating the matter, writes Jamie Jackson.Women’s football: England’s Lionesses continue to be nowhere near as good as their delusional manager Phil Neville seems to think they are and were beaten by the USA in their SheBelieves Cup opener in Orlando yesterday.

Newcastle news: Steve Bruce fears it is “pretty inevitable” that Premier League games will be played behind closed doors as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.The authorities in Italy have introduced a ban on mass gatherings which has hit sports events, and Bruce believes it is only a matter of time before the same happens in the UK.Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, he said: “It’s hard to imagine, isn’t it? But obviously, they’re doing it now in Italy and it’s something we’re probably going to face. We all know football is a way out for everybody, but people’s lives are at stake and we’ve got to go by the authorities. But it looks pretty inevitable that could be on the cards.”The potential for some respite then, for disillusioned Newcastle fans who remain unhappy with their team’s style of play under Bruce.Newcastle duo ink new deals: Jonjo Shelvey, 28, and Matt Ritchie, 30, have both signed new three-year contracts which will keep them at the Premier League club until 2023.Our chief football correspondent writes: David Hytner has penned an interesting comment piece on the furore surrounding Eric Dier’s spirited, fraternal foray into the White Hart Lane stands in the wake of Tottenham’s FA Cup defeat at the hands of Norwich City on Wednesday night.While no supporters were harmed in the making of this controversy, Dier almost certainly regrets his actions and is apparently resigned to whatever ban he inevitably receives from the Football Association for angrily making his way over 15 rows of seats with intent. His manager, however, has stood by him and urged Tottenham to do the same.Meanwhile, Dier’s rush of blood to the head has intensified the focus on fan behaviour, specifically the behaviour of those entitled dunderheads who think buying a ticket for a football match entitles them to scream toxic abuse at the players putting on the show. Read on and feel free to add your two cents in the comments section below ...The Manchester derby is probably the pick of the bunch, although the eye is also draw to wobbling Liverpool’s game against Bournemouth at Anfield and Tottenham’s trip to Turf Moor as they attempt to halt a run of four consecutive defeats.The only manager in football history ever to lose players through injury, José Mourinho has been getting his excuses in early, having told the BBC the club hierarchy must choose between prioritising the weekend’s clash with Burnley or the upcoming Champions League visit to Leipzig.“In this moment I have to think about what’s next and I have to speak to my club because I think some of these boys to have a chance to fight Tuesday for a Champions League position they just can’t play on Saturday,” he said, somewhat bafflingly.The spread of coronavirus means it is likely matches will be played behind closed doors this month, writes Paul MacInnes.Sasha Ryazantsev, the Everton chief financial officer, said banning fans from games in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus would be a decision imposed on clubs. However, with Italian authorities having taken the decision to play Serie A games behind closed doors until April, the possibility of something similar here is increasing.“It would be a forced decision rather than one we would proactively engage in,” said Ryazantsev at the FT Business of Football Summit in London. “But the whole situation goes far beyond the world of sport. Nobody wants to play behind closed doors and I don’t think it’s inevitable that it will happen. But we feel it is quite likely it may happen in the coming weeks.”Welcome to your one-stop shop for all the news and build-up ahead of another weekend’s piping hot football action.

Abandoning the stereotypical castles, creatures and grizzled beardy wizards of high fantasy, the game took place in a quasi-futuristic world the likes of which had never been seen in this style of game before. The revolutionary 3D modelled characters, the sci-fi stylings and detailed, often cinematic visuals, led critics and fans to declare it one of the greatest video games of all time.This April, the Final Fantasy VII Remake promises to redefine the genre again, and developer Square Enix has been keen to point out that this is no shot-for-shot remake. Much will be familiar – the opening cinematic, with Cloud Strife, the game’s iconic, big-haired, big-sworded mercenary hero, arriving at the train station – has been lovingly updated, and the game’s first chapter, of which a demo has been made available this week, takes players on a beautifully re-created version of the original’s Mako reactor bombing mission.But Final Fantasy VII Remake expands greatly on that world, and will be released in multiple episodes, each providing a unique experience. In the opening release arriving in April, the whole adventure will be set in the slums of Midgar, a sprawling metropolis that is home to the mighty Shinra corporation, which was only seen for a couple of hours in the original. According to the development team, this expansion will “fill in the blanks” from the original, adding depth and detail that wasn’t possible 23 years ago.“The philosophy behind the remake wasn’t to do something completely new,” explains the remake’s co-director, Naoki Hamaguchi, who has worked on the Final Fantasy series since 2003. “The original game was grounded in the technology of the day. And because of that, there was a lot of storytelling that the player had to fill in with their imagination. In the original, for example, when you travelled between areas, the screen would fade to black players didn’t see the journey.While staying faithful to the original narrative and locations, Final Fantasy VII Remake will add intricate environmental detail. Midgar now feels like a living, breathing city with fascinating new elements to discover. Take the posters on the train platform in that first mission: “We thought, who comes to this platform? What kind of information would they want? Who’d want to put up posters here? I really hope players see how deeply we’ve gone into the world,” says Hamaguchi. Elsewhere, the game’s second chapter introduces us to deadly villain Sephiroth, and plants the seeds of the history between him and Cloud, which the game will contextualise.Some additions are more nuanced. In the first chapter of the game, as in the original, your team are on an eco-terrorist bombing mission to take down Mako Reactor 1, which is being used by the nefarious Shinra Electric Power Company to exploit the planet’s essential natural Lifestream and threatening life itself in the process.“In the original, the character performances had to be very over-the-top,” explains Hamaguchi. Now, we get a subtle picture of what your team are thinking, breaking down the motivations of returning fan-favourite character Barret. “You don’t just see his gung-ho attitude. After they blow up the reactor, he has doubts and internal conflict. He obviously believes in his cause, but he’s wondering if he did the right thing.”Together with the extra storytelling time, refined voice acting performances will add to the authenticity of the world. Battles, too, are faithful to the original’s gameplay – but more dynamic. And importantly, more fun, employing a hybrid of the original’s complex Active Time Battle system with real-time combat. It’s a clever combination that is both fast-paced and strategic.In line with the classic ATB setup, you must wait for your character’s gauge to build up in order to use magic and to heal, but can use real-time battling to thrash your other weapons at enemies in the meantime. You must switch wisely between those in your party to use their move specialities against appropriate boss weak-spots, too. Cloud’s huge sword is as satisfying as weapons come for close-quarters melee attacks, while Barret’s machine gun (handily also part of his arm) is best used for long-range attacks Tifa employs martial arts skills, and Aerith uses support-style magic to aid her allies. It’s a lot to think about in the heat of a boss fight, but the complexities make battling rewarding.“We really did look at what made the original Final Fantasy VII what it was: all the characters, the story, the mini games.” says Hamaguchi. “We’ve definitely got mini games …” Considering the remake is all about nuance and naturalism, it is surprising to hear that mini games will return: it’s difficult to imagine the retro, old-school hangover of this convention being part of the industrial, gritty, highly-defined Midgar world. And yet, some of the most abiding memories of the original game are tapping buttons in a specific order to do squats in the gym at the Wall Market, slicing left and right on your motorcycle in the G Bike game, or tapping furiously to arm-wrestle a sumo warrior in the Wonder Square. And who can resist a Chocobo race?“They’re all in there,” confirms Hamaguchi. “We didn’t just reproduce the ones from the original game there really are a lot of different mini games there.”Now that the first episode of Final Fantasy VII Remake is almost here, the team is working on its sequel, which will take us further into the world beyond Midgar. There’s no word yet on how many more instalments there will be beyond that, but the developers have been open about the saga continuing for not years, but decades, with producer Yoshinori Kitase, another Final Fantasy veteran, announcing that he plans to work on it for the rest of his career. And there is certainly rich enough material to carry it on for as long. It is clear, once again, that there is nothing at all final about this fantasy.• Final Fantasy VII Remake is released on PS4 on 10 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da591d12e459aaa3900b1e071307dc87d8d1fb6a/0_51_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76548c097fbf2a5c631e6fe2f6bd71ab","title":"from sous chef to security guard how the nation uses its smart speakers","story":"While more than one in five households now own a smart speaker, not everyone is getting the most out of their device. We asked some Amazon Echo users to share their most-used commandsSmart speakers have become a fact of life in the UK in 2019, so much so that in March this year, they were added to the list of items the government uses to accurately measure the cost of living.For some, the Echo is the perfect device to keep children entertained on a regular basis. Laura Moross, a PR consultant from London, explains that her family’s Echo is placed in the kitchen, so that she can use it when playing with the children or helping her kids with their homework.“At breakfast we can shout out song requests – everything from Baby Shark to G-Love and Special Sauce,” she says.Last Christmas, she says, she used the Echo to amuse her children by asking Alexa to track Santa’s whereabouts around the world, as well as asking: “Alexa, how many sleeps until Christmas?” Meanwhile, her children are also amused to hear the Echo’s various fart noises on demand.Meanwhile, Govind Dhaliwal, 31, from Milton Keynes, uses the device while he cooks – to convert units of measurement, and also as a timer.“I can run multiple Alexa timers simultaneously – and I can identify each one by giving them names, that way I know when to check on the food,” he says.Dhaliwal also uses the BBC Good Food skill from time to time to get specific recipes read out to him. He says that the “hands-free” element helps him to focus on cooking without having to keep washing his hands to revert back to a screen to read the recipe again.“It’s especially helpful as you can ask Alexa to pause the recipe while you carry out each part of the method and then carry on from where you left off,” he says.Kate Smith, 35, from London, asks Alexa to turn on her downstairs lights when she walks into the room. This works using a smart plug, which she has connected to her lamps.“It’s quite nice to walk in and be able to turn on the lamps to provide mood lighting, as we don’t use the main lights as much,” she says.In addition, Smith asks Alexa to add items to her shopping list, which can also be viewed on the Alexa app on her phone, meaning she doesn’t have to worry about forgetting her shopping list anymore.For Paul Granger, 67, from Derbyshire, the main reason he uses the Echo is to listen to Audible in his living room.“Since retiring I have more leisure time, and I enjoy being able to sit down and listen to one of my favourite books, while taking in the view of my garden at the same time,” he says.In addition, Granger uses Alexa to remind him to take his medication and to ask for the latest news from the . To do this he asks Alexa to open the , and then asks for the latest cricket headlines and the latest news on Brexit.There are also those that rely on Alexa to control their smart homes.Kelly Morgan, 23, from Hull, has connected her smart speaker to her smart lights, doorbell, camera and lock. This means she can ask Alexa to lock her front door without the need for keys. It also gives her peace of mind when she’s on holiday.“We keep the Echo on when we’re away, as the doorbell triggers Alexa announcements, and we also have scheduled the lights to go on at certain times to give people the impression that we’re at home,” she says.As our world becomes more connected, smart speakers will only prove more useful – perhaps, one day, even vital. But even in 2019, a mere five years since Amazon Echo first hit the market and took smart speakers mainstream, the question is less “What can I use my Echo for?” and more “What can’t I use it for?”Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b22eeab50acc7b9dfd2966c05a8568c6abde54/0_317_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df671746e64d79ac6e90201c3a3e058f","title":"can a shaman cure my insomnia","story":"I always rejected my mother’s ideas of chakras and balance. But on holiday in Bali, I saw a sign: healing this way“At the end of the session, Sami will tell you all your problems,” reads the outline of my meeting with a traditional Balinese healer, the fifth generation of shamans in his family. All my problems? How long has he got?I did not expect that a holiday in Bali would lead me to a healer, in search of an insomnia cure. The idea of chakras has never really appealed. I grew up with these concepts, having been raised in a mostly Asian community, by a mother who evangelised about mind-and-body balance. To this day, the smell of incense conjures up my childhood. But that was all the stuff of my elders who, in my teenage eyes, seemed stuck in the past. Later, I’d smirk when people called this stuff “new age”. New for who, exactly?But in Bali I saw a sign on the street: Healing This Way. And, perhaps moved by the sight of exquisite temples and their devoted attendees, combined with a when-in-Rome attitude and worsening sleeplessness, I followed that sign.As I write, I don’t know if it worked (Sami said to wait three days). I know that the full-body procedure was painful: the fingers prodded deeply for pressure points. And I know that when he “cleansed my energy” and said I shouldn’t criticise myself too much, nor worry about things I might have done wrong in the past because I did everything right, that I felt tears rush to my eyes. (Although I had also been punched in the butt for an hour, so that might explain it.)In the taxi home, I read about the placebo effect – how it is no longer seen as a medical failure, but an effective treatment for conditions in which the brain controls symptoms such as insomnia. If you can trick the brain into thinking it’s healed, it is.

The miniature poodle, who won the utility group presentation in which dogs are assessed on their weight and measurements, could be mistaken for looking slightly dejected.Much has been written about the impact of Brexit on education and the arts, but few have been concerned about another industry affected by new immigration rules: the world of canine performance competitions.Crufts, the world’s biggest dog show, held at Birmingham’s NEC Arena, experienced a significant drop in overseas dog entries this year, with organisers blaming the fall on Britain’s recent departure from the EU.As the first agility contests got under way, several rows of seats in the arena stood empty, and stallholders noted the venue’s halls were less busy than usual.The Kennel Club, which organises Crufts, said notification from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that travel regulations for pets would remain the same during the Brexit transition period was only received after entries had closed on 20 January.A spokesperson said: “Crufts is a British institution with an international feel and is a great celebration of dogs, regardless of where they live.“As with many areas of British life, the future movement of dogs across the Channel in a post-Brexit world is a concern, and many dog owners – who needed to enter the Crufts by 20 January – could have been put off by the uncertainty around pet travel.”This year, 42 overseas countries will take part in the gundog, working and pastoral, terrier and hound, and toy and utility categories, down from a peak of 55 in 2017.Kathleen Roosens, from Belgium, who owns last year’s best in show winner, said she believed Brexit was the only reason fewer Europeans were entering Crufts.“Some people I spoke to feared they needed rabies tests, and others didn’t enter because of not knowing what ‘worse case’ could be,” said Roosens, who won best in breed for Papillons on Thursday with her dog Simon, the brother of last year’s winner, Dylan.Until 31 December 2020, when the transition period ends, dogs will still be able to travel to the show without quarantine using a passport introduced under the pet travel scheme in 2002.After that, new arrangements for pets to travel around the EU will be made by the government.Annick Provost, 57, a bus driver from Belgium, said if regulations were to be toughened, she could be priced out of the competition.Many of those selling dog merchandise said crowds were sparser than usual on Thursday.Kelly Clifford, a sales manager for the sustainable dog food brand Beco Pets, said the event was “very quiet”, while Angela Pinder, who owns the cruelty-free pet grooming product range Paw Naturel, said she had been surprised by the lack of footfall.Elain MacDonald, preening her shih-tzu Willow’s impressively sleek hairdo in between competitions, said she had been coming to Crufts since 1976 but had “never seen it like this”.Although more than 160,000 people are expected to attend the event over the weekend, a Kennel Club spokesperson confirmed ticket sales had been down on usual numbers, and that some ticket holders may not have attended on Thursday because of coronavirus fears.Earlier in the week, the major sponsors, Royal Canin and James Wellbeloved, pulled their staff from Crufts in line with a temporary policy that they should only attend large events if it is “business critical”.Inga Finsell, a spectator from Eastbourne, who has been attending Crufts for more than 40 years, seemed unfazed. “It’s nice because it’s a lot quieter because people haven’t come. It was miserable trying to get around last year,” Finsell said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e0ced5796cc9b79df841d325b4c2fc7a8605331/0_7_1172_703/master/1172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83b2796ebd5ba15d1908e3ef5dca96c5","title":"not learning portuguese romesh ranganathan this is europe","story":"I am still being lazy and ignorant, but this time it’s for a reasonThis summer I will be visiting Portugal for the fifth year in a row, which is either a huge compliment to the country’s hospitality or a true illustration of the rut into which the Ranganathans have descended. We even go so far as to stay in exactly the same place every time, considering it adventurous to pop to a beach we haven’t been to before.The reasons for this are mainly to do with how great Portugal is: it has sunshine and beautiful beaches and lovely food and welcoming locals, like many holiday destinations, but without wanting to sound like one of those wankers who’s just been travelling, we just like the vibe. I also love familiarity. I like turning up to the house and knowing whose room is whose. I know that we unpack quickly and head to the local supermarket to stock up. I know that I text my mum to let her know we’ve arrived safely, and she replies telling me to remember that children go missing there.The one thing I haven’t done, much to my chagrin, is to learn any Portuguese whatsoever. The truth is that there is no real need, as everybody is used to tourists and speaks impeccable English, but still it feels lazy. The first time I went, I didn’t feel bad I’m not going to start learning a new language for a single trip. But having been many times now, the decision not to try to at least pick up some key phrases seems wilfully ignorant.Before my wife and I had kids, when holidays were about having a nice time, we visited Barcelona for a weekend. I speak a little bit of Spanish, and used it when we went to restaurants and bars. The main effect was impressing my wife, because she speaks no Spanish and it looked as if I knew what I was doing. In order to keep her impressed, I had to pretend that what arrived at the table was what I thought I had ordered, and that, yes, I had decided that tonight she might like the squid she had always told me she hated.Learning Portuguese would be a wonderful way of connecting with the locals and engaging with the country in a deeper way. But I know this is not what will happen. What is more likely to happen is that I will try to learn Portuguese for a couple of weeks, forget about it for ages, and then start again in the two weeks before the holiday. Then my wife and children will watch me offend a series of locals by struggling to say something basic, and then being completely unable to understand the response.For this reason, I would strongly argue that not speaking Portuguese not only makes the holiday better, and subject to fewer logistical errors, but is also better for Ranga–Porto relations. And so I have resolved not to learn the language, and this time feel much better about it, because it is a considered rather than a default position. I am still being lazy and ignorant, but for a reason.What I could do instead, over the next few years, is learn at my own pace. Gradually pick it up with no deadline, until one summer, as we head to the first supermarket shop of the holiday, I start smashing out fluent Portuguese, understanding responses, and engaging with grocery items in a way that previously seemed impossible. My wife and children will look on in awe as one of the shop assistants unlocks a door accessible only to people who speak the language – where the bread is fresher and the prices lower.Far more likely is that I don’t, and instead use my one Portuguese word in every interaction and wait for the locals to be impressed, in a way that I haven’t been by the fact they speak completely fluent English. And then I will kiss my new blue passport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae78408689938bf0317cbc740debb89912e5ef46/561_293_3578_2147/master/3578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592500ff2c56b12dfb20da94aa23b873","title":"canine stars at crufts in pictures","story":"More than 26,000 dogs and 166,000 fans are expected over the four days of Crufts this year at the NEC in Birmingham.

The corporation said the move would save tens of millions of pounds a year, helping it to reduce its spending in line with cuts imposed by the government after 2010.Much of the channel’s budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three became an online-only commissioning strand in the belief that younger audiences were better reached online.Sharon White, the recently departed boss of the media regulator Ofcom, previously said the broadcast channel was closed “probably a number of years too early”, suggesting the corporation jumped the gun in terms of where younger audiences watch their content.The view inside the corporation is that BBC Three has produced far more interesting and innovative programmes since it was taken off traditional free-to-air television, where its broadcast audience was often propped up by reruns of EastEnders and the US import Family Guy.It is now seen as a key incubator of new talent at the BBC, while the growing use of co-productions – where a foreign company, often a US streaming service, shares some of the upfront production outlay – has reduced the cost of making dramas.The BBC is facing a battle with the government over its future, amid calls for non-payment of the licence fee to be decriminalised. The corporation needs to show it can remain relevant to younger audiences who have drifted away to commercial services such as Netflix. The average viewer of the BBC’s television channels is now in their 60s, while fewer than half of under-35s watch BBC1, BBC2, or BBC4 in a given week.As a result, the corporation is prioritising extra resources for programmes that appeal to younger, more erse, and less middle-class audiences.On Thursday, the BBC director general, Tony Hall, praised the quality of BBC Three’s output, which has won it a reputation for commissioning bold documentaries and hit shows such as Fleabag and This Country. Upcoming drama includes adaptations of Sally Rooney’s novels.Hall told a conference that taking BBC Three off air “was a brave decision and it seemed absolutely right at the time”.

For some, it is the night Thee Oh Sees played in the games room and had people dancing on the pool tables. For Lyndsay “Lins” Wilson – who used to live opposite and wheeled her amplifier over to play in bands such as Grammatics and Mother Vulpine – it is the time that the Israeli punks Monotonix “set fire to the drum kit, wrapped the drummer up in a rug and carried him outside on a stool while the audience formed a conga line around the car park”. Licensee and promoter Nathan Clark laughs as he recalls how a cab driver once got onstage during a gig and grabbed the microphone to yell: “Taxi for Cooper!”The 107-year old venue encourages colourful things to happen. To walk through the old wooden doors of this innocuous looking concrete building is to enter a Tardis. It reveals two 400-capacity live rooms (one an amphitheatre shape, the second – square – added recently), a games room laden with historic plaques of former club presidents and a bustling bar that reflects its origins as a working men’s club. Johnny Marr calls it a “special place”. Evening drinker Martin Trippet, 59, who has been coming here for 20 years, describes the “Brude” as “the best local in the world. Where else can you come for a few pints after work, and walk into another room and see Sebadoh?”In mid-February, I spend a few days watching the comings and goings at the Brudenell. It is a in a stronger position than many. It is a nonprofit enterprise, with any surplus cash reinvested into such things as the topnotch sound system. Crucially, the club owns the building and land so “there’s no rent and no nasty landlord”, says Clark. Its LS6 location – a bus ride from the city centre – means it avoids higher rates and lies in an area densely populated with students and young people.“The Brudenell’s part of the reason I moved to Leeds,” says Sarah Statham, 32, who has never lived more than a 10-minute walk away since relocating from Manchester in 2007. She has played the Brude 34 times in bands such as Esper Scout and Fig By Four. She has met friends and partners here and was approached to form the indie-folk act Crake when she was here playing Flaming Lips songs wearing a bear costume. “There’s something very community-spirited about the hybrid of 18-year-old students and 70-year-old people who’ve never left Leeds,” she says, sitting in the snug area by the games room. “It’s a comfortable place to be for a lot of erse people.”Clark sees his venue as “first and foremost” a community hub, and staff and punters alike make unusually personal connections with the place. Chris Tyrer, who works the door, courted his wife here. The couple had their wedding reception in the club free of charge as their “wedding present”. When Statham was unable to insure her van, Clark let her park it on the premises for a year. He mentions a recent incident when a regular texted him from the bar on a Saturday to complain about a new slimline tonic. “I said, ‘OK, we won’t buy that one again,’” he chuckles. “What other place could people message like that and know that they’re being listened to?”Clark grew up in the terraces behind the Brudenell. One of his earliest memories, aged seven, is of kicking a football around at the Rock Against Racism all-dayer at the adjoining Royal Park pub while bands played on an outdoor stage. “Growing up I saw a lot of punk bands, weird stuff,” he says one afternoon, seated in what will later become the merch area. “People with different hairstyles and clothing became the norm and everyone was in a band so in the next street I’d hear guitars. You just don’t get that in most streets in the UK.” His builder father loved nights in the Brudenell and, in 1992, when the declining social club faced a potentially terminal tax bill, he paid the debt off and changed career to run the place (“He felt ownership and cared about it”). In 1995, when riots erupted and the nearby Newlands pub was burned down, the Brudenell hosted the planning meetings for Hyde Park Unity Day, a free outdoor gig (now in its 24th year) that brought the community together. Gradually, the venue’s entertainment focus shifted from comedy to the DIY scene. “My father was very open to letting people use the space,” Clark says. “It was never: ‘That’s a fucking racket.’ It was a blank canvas for everything from Termite noise club to weird art projects.”By the late 90s, Clark was following his other lifelong passion – football – as a trainee at Sheffield Wednesday before landing a professional contract in the US with MLS side Portland Timbers. Then came the bombshell news that his father was dying with lymphoma. “He’d put so much work into this,” Clark sighs. “So there was a desire to not let someone else come along and wreck it.”After helping his mum run the venue while he was studying for a business degree, Clark took over in 2003. His mum cooked for the bands. Joanna Newsom’s monitor rocked on a beer crate. The Fall’s first dressing room consisted of a sofa in the kitchen. When the venue was teetering over the cost of mandated soundproof fire doors, the community rallied to raise the money. “Competitions. Gigs. We even did a musical Bullseye one night,” Clark recalls. “But every penny counted.”Clark thinks the venue may put on more gigs than any other in the UK – as many as six bands a night. Artists are often greeted by the main house soundman, Trevor Baines, 53, who spent years in tribute bands and understands “what bands have been through to get to that place where they might be grumpy with you,” he says. “You have to be patient with people, but most are not off their face on drink on drugs. They’re nice.” Baines has mixed the sound here for 17 years and admits to “long days” but unexpected rewards: “You might get to see Thurston Moore pay guitar with spoons, which I’d never get in an arena.”Bands from Liars to Nightmares on Wax have shot album covers here and the bigger recent Leeds bands – Hookworms, Eagulls et al – emerged after playing the Brudenell. Meanwhile, it hosts everything from children’s concerts (with quieter sound and heightened lighting) to televised football and even giant games of Risk. Over three nights in the club (the first, unusually, has no gig, but the bar is still very busy), I watch Joe Gideon do a free gig, Rochdale singer-songwriter Kirk McElhinney and Dubioza Kolektiv, a surreal Bosnian version of Madness, whose rave-ska and wild-eyed instructions on “how to tango, Bosnian-style” bring the house down.Clark knows what is right for the venue (“Music we think is great or we think people should be listening to”) and otherwise. When an outside promoter wanted to use search dogs outside a drill gig, he told them, “We’re not that kind of venue” and the gig was moved. Clark booked one of this week’s turns – Laurence Fox – before the actor-singer’s infamous Question Time appearance. He is fearing protests, but admits that cancelling could have led to legal action over the fee and possibly defamation. “So we thought the best thing would be to just let the gig take place to 50 people or whatever.” Which is precisely what happens.Prior to locking up for another night, Clark admits that sustaining the Brudenell can be a burden and that he is already making plans to future-proof the venue from developers. He does have some days off (“for Leeds United matches”) but with no children and “no ties”, the venue is his life. Could the 39-year old ever contemplate doing something else? “I don’t like to think about it,” he admits, “but it’s not: ‘What am I getting out of this?’ It’s about building memories and bringing people together for more than a night out. There are people coming here and working here who’ve made bonds for life. That’s rewarding. I like to think we do some good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b53bd4eeb36e25121208ee6ed1c26b7c75ff7ab/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=679223d6941ccb59dc4e57f9b0db6d3b 2020w","title":"labour faces claims members yet to receive leadership ballots","story":"Several campaign teams for leader and deputy say that many people are still waitingLabour is under pressure to step up its efforts to ensure party members receive their leadership ballots amid widespread reports of glitches.Several leadership and deputy leadership campaigns have told the  their canvassers are picking up a large volume of party members still awaiting their ballot.The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),\u0026nbsp Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).The ballot of members and registered supporters was due to open on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a £25 registered supporter by 16 January.Corbyn’s successor - Starmer, Long-Bailey or Nandy - will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.The issue appears to be particularly acute for new members who joined the party after December’s election, believed to number more than 100,000, who are being subjected to a verification process that involves checking their address against the electoral roll.Polling suggests this group, as well as those who joined before Jeremy Corbyn became leader, are less likely to support his preferred candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey.Some may have joined in the hope of voting for Jess Phillips, who was campaigning for new members to sign up, but withdrew from the contest as it became clear she was unlikely to receive the endorsement of any of the major unions.A second campaign described a “large scale failure”, with “many, many people” having to reapply for their ballots.Another Labour source, with knowledge of the process, claimed queries had been raised about the eligibility of thousands of new members, with staff unable to match their details with the electoral roll. Members are then contacted, and given the opportunity to resolve the discrepancy.Labour’s website warns members they may have to wait up to 10 days for a ballot to be reissued if they have missed out. Members can also use a self-service portal to make the request, but there are claims of a backlog.Chris Matheson, the MP for Chester and a Starmer supporter, said: “It is very worrying that two thirds of the way into this contest many Labour members appear not to have received their ballot papers. The general secretary needs to provide urgent assurance that all outstanding ballots will be dispatched as soon as possible.”Lisa Nandy supporter Louise Haigh, the MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: “Lots of new members who have joined our party since the devastation of the general election to have a say in our future have a right to their vote and it must be exercised. The party need to sort this out immediately and make sure all members are reassured they will get a chance to vote.”Voting opened last week, and will continue until noon on 2 April, with the result due to be announced at a special conference on 4 April. Labour officials declined to comment, but pointed out there is still plenty of time for queries to be resolved and ballots issued.Long-Bailey has sought to shake up the race in recent days by challenging Starmer over how his well-oiled campaign machine is being funded.Pressed on the issue by Andrew Neil on Wednesday, the shadow Brexit secretary revealed that the £100,000 donation from a fellow barrister he reported earlier this week was the largest he has received.Long-Bailey told Neil: “I think there’s always an assumption that you don’t get something for nothing in this world. And those who donate to your campaign will expect to be repaid in some way in the future.”Her campaign has received significant contributions from the Unite trade union, and from leftwing Labour group Momentum, whose founder, Jon Lansman, is chairing her campaign.Wigan MP Nandy, who has been more critical of Labour’s policies and approach than either of her two rivals, told HuffPost on Wednesday she remained confident she could still win, saying there were “a lot of members who are undecideds, who haven’t made up their mind who their first choice is”.She hopes to nose ahead of Long-Bailey, whose second preferences she would then hope to pick up.There have been few stark policy disagreements during the campaign, with Starmer adopting 10 markedly leftwing “pledges”, including widespread nationalisation, abolishing tuition fees and passing a new law to prevent illegal wars.Starmer received the backing of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown on Thursday, who said he, “has all the qualifications that are necessary for a prime minister of the future”.“A vote for Keir Starmer is a vote for hope. It’s a vote for the future. It’s a vote for the values that all of us believe in deeply,” Brown said.Long-Bailey has prioritised the environment, saying she would seek to make it a part of Labour’s constitution, in a new clause IV. And she has also focused on party democracy, calling for open selection of all parliamentary candidates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/595a73a897f9653562186042333d1349027240d5/0_235_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07cc9fbfe377c75d057d70743d14243e","title":"alun wyn jones dan biggar to face england wales rugby union","story":"The Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, tried to dampen down injury concerns over Dan Biggar by insisting the fly-half will play against England on Saturday.

He joined a group of alien chasers, but being a black Dominican among mostly white believers was challengingThe first time my dad ever heard someone talk about aliens and objetos volador no identificados, or UFOs, was when he was 13. One day in high school, an older student described a sighting to my dad. “The first thing I thought was, ‘This man looked like an alien to me!’ He was so out of the ordinary: blonde hair, white skin, blue eyes, in a sea of black bodies like mine,” my dad recalls being told.The talk with the older student validated a curiosity first sparked by a walk to school about five years prior. On an empty road in Cristo Rey, a lower-middle class, industrial neighborhood in Santo Domingo, a ball of light the size of a car tire appeared about 80 to 100 feet above him. It pulsated, moved steadily, horizontally, away from him, then vanished.“I was paralyzed for like 30 seconds. I didn’t understand what it was. I was so scared,” he told me. “I didn’t tell anyone because no one would have believed me.” He marks that day as one that changed him forever. “I started looking up all the time, looking at the sky,” he said.For my dad, a black teen growing up poor in the Dominican Republic, trying to learn everything he could about extraterrestrial life proved nearly impossible. There was no extra money to buy books, and no reliable public transportation to the Biblioteca Nacional Pedro Henríquez Ureña. Plus, his religious household – Seventh Day Adventists with a belief system that classified alcohol, tattoos, piercings, and rock music as satanic – inhibited him. “If you do something wrong, I would often hear, the devil is going to come for you,” he told me. “It made me fearful of being curious and asking questions.”But by 19, paychecks from his job at a bank allowed him to buy books on UFOs, aliens, the Bermuda Triangle. He watched local and international news, which is where he first learned about the alien abduction of Freddy Miller, who disappeared in Santo Domingo in 1959 and reappeared in 1973.It was not until his move to America in 1991, however, that my father’s curiosity – and by extension, my own – truly took root.Growing up in what I affectionately call the Segura Alien Household meant family trips to Barnes \u0026amp Noble to buy books on astronomy, physics, Area 51, and government cover-ups. By 11, I could discuss things like the reptilian conspiracy theory – which alleged that governments around the world were controlled by aliens disguised as humans – as easily as I could discuss Steely Dan, my father’s favorite band and the soundtrack to our reading and talking about outer space.Alien pictures my father drew and painted – aliens with white skin, long arms, black eyes, and a grimace creatures with pointed ears and fangs – lined the walls of our home. He drew an alien race with long arms and slanted eyebrows titled “the Pamelians” for my younger sister, Pamela, who, by age 13, was convinced she would be abducted by extraterrestrials it was only a matter of when.My dad would become so rapt watching the History Channel’s UFO Files and Ancient Aliens that my sister and I weren’t allowed to ask him questions until an episode was over. Still, I wondered: how many aliens exist? Where did they live? How did they live? Were they, like me, listening to their fathers talk about life beyond the world that they saw?It was during an episode of Ancient Aliens that my father first heard about the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of alien enthusiasts who study alleged UFO sightings.In 2015, he became a member. As a shy man, local chapter meetings never appealed to him, but as a truck driver on the road five to six days a week, whether in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, or Charlotte, North Carolina, he connected to a hub of others who shared his unusual theories. It offered a refuge, company. Mufon allowed my dad to feel like he belonged, no matter where he was originally from.Then in 2018, Newsweek reported on a wave of resignations within Mufon after John Ventre – the state director for the organization’s Pennsylvania chapter, one of the largest in the country – posted on his personal Facebook that white men in America were being attacked by “illegal affirmative action” and “interracial couples in every show and commerical”. Despite apologizing the day after his post, Ventre resigned as state director. “I don’t hate anybody, I apologized for what I said” he told Newsweek. “I’m feeling like because I’m a 60-year-old white man I’m getting totally unfairly attacked here.”The fallout continued. Mufon board members and other chapter leaders resigned after learning of Mufon’s ties to JZ Knight, an author and New Age teacher, who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, has made derogatory comments about Mexicans, LGBTQ people, Catholics, and Jews.“It’s very disappointing to me to hear about these people, and the organization should be more careful,” my dad told me. “But I’m not going to move away from a place where I am able to get access to a world that I love.”My father cherished the digital space this organization allotted him, and with my encouragement, was even considering attending local chapter meetings after he retired. But after learning about Ventre and Knight, I was worried. I wondered if Mufon was actually not safe, not a sanctuary, for a black man like him. So, I went to a meeting myself.Windsor Locks, Connecticut is two hours north of New York City and home to just under 13,000 people. The town, according to Mufon, has one of the highest numbers of reported UFO sightings in America. On a Saturday in February, I joined about 70 members – almost entirely white – at a pizzeria to discuss sightings that had occurred nearby, and hear a psychic talk about the secret space program called Solar Warden. “Solar Warden is a program based in Dahlgren, Virginia, run by the US navy that is responsible for monitoring all traffic in our solar system,” the psychic told us, as people around the table nodded knowingly. “It was developed in the 1960s and 70s and deployed by earth governments to protect Earth from hostile aliens.”Once the meeting was over, I wanted to talk to some members, many of whom have been attending for years. There was Pat, a woman in her 60s with bright red hair and married to another member, Mike. I met Mickey, an intense man who ranted about my iPhone giving me cancer and how aliens were, at that very moment, all around us. “Their technology is so advanced, we wouldn’t even be able to see them,” he said.And there was Geoffrey P Whittum, who calls himself “the Woods Walker” and believes that there is evidence of alien habitation in the forests of Connecticut. Although many were fervent in their attempts to convince me that the government was poisoning Americans through spacecraft – a common belief shared by all the members I talked with – not one of them seemed racist. They all seemed to enjoy gathering and creating a space where they could express their obscure thoughts about life beyond our world.After those initial greetings with members, I eventually worked up the nerve to ask everyone I talked with if they were familiar with Ventre and other allegations of racism within Mufon. They all said no. “Everyone is welcome here, no matter what you look like or believe,” Pat said.I left pleasantly surprised by the camaraderie I found. It felt almost spiritual. I wanted to return with my father to introduce him to a space that he has only known digitally but that proved more welcoming than I expected.On the ride back home to the Bronx, my thoughts about my father had become clear. I guess I’ve always known that he’s brilliant – he can play instruments, write songs, knows a lot about history, excels in math. Aliens are just one of the many facets of who he is. But what if he had arrived in America sooner – before marriage, before kids – and had the resources my sister and I enjoyed? Would he have been an astronomer? Written sci-fi? Worked for Nasa?That night, I told him about the Mufon meeting and the people I’d met. He seemed relieved and happy because there I was, over 50 years after he fell in love with space, enthusiastically rambling about government cover-ups, UFOs, and extraterrestrial life. “They’ve got a skywatch in the spring, and I’m invited,” I told him. “Let’s go and look up at the sky together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253717d7d054a2ec9e06c95b406fb38a1973198d/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7c7db2074ece8b75a3899d1284fdd1","title":"before and after coronavirus empties worlds busiest spaces","story":"Aerial images reveal impact of outbreak on famous holy sites and capital citiesEmpty public squares, a highway with no cars on it and deserted holy sites – a series of striking satellite images have revealed the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on some of the world’s busiest spaces.The aerial photographs, released by Colorado-based space technology firm Maxar, show normally bustling spots from Mecca to Beijing thinned of people.One image shows a handful of pilgrims circling the granite Kaaba at Mecca’s Grand Mosque – a sacred site usually thronged with worshippers from every corner of the Muslim world.Saudi Arabian authorities have suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage to Islam’s holiest place, in a bid to stop the spread of the virus which has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide.An image above the Hazrat Masumeh Shrine in Qom shows one of Iran’s most hallowed places virtually empty as its famed golden dome shimmers in the sunlight.Streets and courtyards around the shrine are similarly vacant.Photos above Wuhan, China – the epicentre of the global outbreak – show an empty street, normally busy with traffic.A photo of Tiananmen Square only a couple of dozen cars passing by and no pedestrians to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d1e02cf6256db33c5dc7e13eafd9dabdba6109/0_303_4548_2729/master/4548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c6d3f9c6c8b8a56a37d90198180f015","title":"chinese schools reopen as coronavirus cases in europe continue to rise","story":"Big rise in number of confirmed cases comes as global tally passes 100,000 markIran has said it may use force to stop people travelling between cities, as it reported a big one-day rise in cases, while globally the number of confirmed cases rose above the 100,000 mark.The possible measure was announced during a televised press conference by a health ministry spokesman, who said the authorities had confirmed 4,747 cases of the virus, a rise of 1,234 on the day before.While he did not elaborate on the threat to use force, the spokesman acknowledged that the virus was present in all of Iran’s 31 provinces.The threat may be aimed at stopping people from using closed schools and universities as an excuse to go to the Caspian Sea and other holiday spots in the run-up to the Persian new year, which falls on 21 March.Semi-official news agencies in Iran posted images of long lines of traffic of people trying to reach the coast from Tehran on Friday despite authorities earlier telling people to remain in their cities.Checkpoints on roads in Mazandaran and Gilan provinces were being operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in perhaps the most visible intervention by the state yet.

Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.The number of confirmed cases of the virus worldwide passed 100,000, according to a tally by the Johns Hopkins University, and the World Health Organization warned some countries were not showing the political commitment needed to “match the level of the threat we all face”.Tehran has been stung by criticism of its handling of the outbreak, pointing to WHO assessments that have not challenged the government’s official figures. Health officials said the new figures may reflect the availability of more accurate testing kits.In two further signs of rising concern about the situation in Iran, Christoph Hamelmann, the WHO country director, told senior overseas diplomats in Tehran that funding was urgently needed for a “rapid upscaling” of laboratory and clinical components, and Saudi Arabia called on citizens to declare visits to Iran in the past 14 days. Members of the kingdom’s Shia minority tend to keep their visits to Iran secret because of the bitter rivalry between the two countries.Elsewhere in the Middle East, 12 new cases were reported among workers on a cruise ship in Egypt. A tourist who travelled on the same ship sailing between Luxor and Aswan tested positive for the virus on her return to Taiwan a week ago.In Europe, Germany, France and the UK have all reported big rises in cases in the past 24 hours. A second death was reported in the UK on Friday, as was the first death in the Netherlands. Meanwhile the first confirmed cases were reported in Cameroon, Togo, Serbia, Bhutan and Vatican City.In Asia, a diplomatic row erupted between Japan and South Korea after Tokyo said it would quarantine all passengers arriving from the country, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases outside China.From Saturday, anyone arriving in Japan from South Korea will be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated sites, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Thursday.Seoul described the move as “unreasonable, excessive and extremely regrettable”, accused Japan of failing to address its own outbreak properly, and threatened retaliatory measures.The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have insisted the Games will open as planned on 24 July, but speculation is growing that they will have to be cancelled.Meanwhile, schools in parts of China are set to reopen as the central province of Hubei – excluding the provincial capital Wuhan – reported no new cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours for the first time since the outbreak began last year.In a sign that parts of China are returning to normal, schools in provinces that have logged no new cases for more than a fortnight began to set dates for school reopenings.On Thursday night, the WHO repeated its warning that inidual countries were responsible for dealing with the disease within their borders – and that some governments needed to do more.“This is not a drill,” said the organisation’s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “This epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor.” While he did not single out any culprits, Tedros said not all countries were demonstrating “the level of political commitment” required to “match the level of the threat we all face”.As the outbreak continued to spread in the US, the Trump administration was forced on to the defensive, amid criticism of its approach to the virus. The president, who last week claimed the risk in the US was “very low” and that the number of cases would be zero in “a few days”, faced questions at an election town hall event in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Thursday night. His vice-president, Mike Pence, who is in charge of the US response, admitted the country did not have enough testing kits to meet demand.Additional reporting by Lily Kuo in Hong Kong and Justin McCurry in Tokyo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf91c3056f38b3edf2134c5ab6e42cd176bf8e2/0_40_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26de6279e8ce706d3557627ff44d5971","title":"coronavirus facts what is the mortality rate and is there a cure covid 19","story":"Covid-19 essential guide: can it be caught on public transport, how is it different from the flu, and how sick will I get? The Covid-19 virus is a member of the coronavirus family that made the jump from animals to humans late last year. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans – current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus’s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two – the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy.If you have symptoms or think you might have been exposed to the virus when travelling or through other contacts, call the NHS 111 service or visit the online service, or contact the equivalent service in your country. Do not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube – though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes.Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial by the end of April. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months “was not unreasonable to assume”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c739560c67d5c36913b54ef4704b58e641da13/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5636d2bce2191a23354311b4999df1b5","title":"coronavirus symptoms what is covid 19 wuhan doctor","story":"What is coronavirus, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

On a crisp winter afternoon with an expansive blue sky above and hardened snow underfoot, the area is criss-crossed with the tracks of hares, deer and wolves. This is the south-eastern tip of Belarus, home to sleepy villages steeped in tradition, where people hang their Christmas trees upside-down from the ceiling and eat raw pig fat as an afternoon snack.It is also part of Polesia, Europe’s largest wilderness. More than two-thirds the size of the UK (18m hectares) and spread across Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, in spring this brittle landscape blooms into a labyrinth of gigantic bogs and swamps that supports large populations of wolves, bison, lynx and 1.5 million migratory birds. It has been called “the Amazon of Europe” for its extraordinary bioersity.Now another catastrophe could be about to befall its people: the construction of the E40 waterway, a 2,000km (1,240-mile) inland shipping route linking the Black Sea and the Baltic that would slice through the wilderness and involve dredging inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Experts say this will destroy vast ecosystems and stir up radioactive sludge that accumulated on the bottom of the river following the explosion, potentially contaminating the drinking water of millions of people.Dredging is due to start in the coming months following what campaigners have called a “quick and dirty” feasibility study that failed to consider the potentially catastrophic loss of bioersity, radioactive contamination of drinking water, or loss of carbon from draining wetlands.“We call E40 the death of Polesia. It would completely kill the south of the country,” says Alexandre Vintchevski, founder of APB-BirdLife Belarus, the country’s largest wildlife NGO. “Very few people know we have our own mini Amazon in Europe which is threatened by the construction of a waterway that no one has heard of.”The ambition to link the Black and Baltic seas dates back thousands of years. The ancient Greeks knew about this region and thought it must have been a sea because there was so much water, while Vikings paddled through Polesia’s rivers during repeated attacks on Constantinople.Small vessels can already pass through regulated stretches of the route but the rivers would need to be significantly broadened, with dams and dykes built and meanders cut off to allow ships at least 80 metres long to pass. The water will need to be at least 2.5 metres deep along the whole route. Up to seven million tonnes of cargo (mainly oil, fertilisers and wood) would pass through each year.The E40 would stretch from Gdansk in Poland to Kherson in Ukraine, impacting five rivers en route: the Vistula, the Bug, the Pina, the Pripyat and the Dnieper, according to the feasibility study led by the Maritime Institute in Gdansk. At its closest it would pass only 2.5km from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, potentially contaminating a reservoir downstream that provides water for 2.8 million people in Kyiv.The E40 project is being pushed by a coalition of organisations and government ministries from Belarus, Poland and Ukraine, which is being led by the the Dnieper-Bug Republican Unitary Maintenance and Construction Enterprise. A coalition of wildlife organisations led by APB-BirdLife Belarus, Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) and the National Ecological Centre of Ukraine is trying to stop the E40 going ahead.The Mid Pripyat Reserve covers 120km of the river and is designed to protect the largest area of natural river floodplain in Europe. Along this stretch alone, 182 bird species have been recorded, many of which are rapidly losing habitats elsewhere.One town within the reserve, Turov, has stood on the site for 1,000 years. The name is believed to originate from tur, the Slavic word for the aurochs, an ancestor of the cow which once would have been common here. These towns are the “bloodlands” of Europe where some of the worst crimes of the 20th century took place, including early Nazi pogroms. In Turov, 500 Jewish people were executed by the Nazis. Today it is home to about 3,000 people, has an ageing population and limited opportunities for the young. Like many towns in Belarus, it has kept Lenin-related street names, statues of Lenin and Soviet murals.It is also one of Europe’s most important sites for migratory birds, and just outside the town is a 144-hectare meadow managed by APB-BirdLife Belarus.Over winter it looks like a large, unremarkable field where cattle are grazing. Networks of shrew tunnels and packs of stray dogs looking for trouble are the main signs of life. Volunteers regularly cut the scrub because wading birds like low grass as it allows nesting females to have a better view of potential danger.In spring, the grassy island comes to life as it is swallowed up by the Pripyat. Globally threatened birds such as lesser white-fronted geese and black-tailed godwits flock here. More than 30 species of birds nest on Turov meadow, including half a million ruff, which have extraordinary mating rituals with some males disguising themselves as females to improve their chances of finding a partner. It has the highest breeding densities of northern lapwing and redshank in the world. There’s an annual party in the village to celebrate the arrival of spring migrants and Vintchevski says international birders are also starting to show an interest in the region.Four hours’ drive downriver is the 190,000-hectare Pripyat National Park, nestled between the rivers Pripyat, Stviga and Ubort. It is visited by 256 bird species and contains rare alluvial oak forests unique to eastern Europe. The spring floods spread nutrients over the forest floor, making it particularly fertile. In winter the woods are still, but tracks in the snow show they are home to hares, wild boar and deer. It is completely silent except for the shrieks of siskin in the canopy.Dr Helen Byron, the Save Polesia campaign coordinator at the FZS, explains that in spring the Pripyat floods in a similar way to the Amazon. “The rivers, the meanders and the marshes are all similar to those found in the Amazon. Its size and importance as a stopover for a large number of birds is widely unknown. There are no other places in Europe where creatures can have so much space, and yet because it was behind the iron curtain people just don’t know about it,” she says.Climate change has already had an impact on the flooding, which means Polesia is becoming an increasingly fragile environment. Between 1955 and 1965, the river initially flooded in the first week of March but now it happens 16 days earlier. Fish are spawning between five and six days earlier. Winter floods are also becoming more frequent, with less flooding in spring, causing large areas of floodplain meadows, marshes, old lakes, wet oak and black alder forests to dry out.Normally in January everything is frozen, but the last January snow fell in 2014, according to Vasil Blotski, who lives in the village of Verasnica with his wife Anastasia Blotskaja, head of Zhytkavichy APB-BirdLife Belarus branch. For Blotski, the river is a good place to take his two children fishing (they once caught a two-metre long catfish). He points out marks on the reeds that show the water level is more than two metres lower than it should be for this time of year.Today he’s caught a small perch, bream and roach in the space of 15 minutes which he’ll cook for supper. He passes around chocolates and raw pig fat as he guts the fish. An eagle owl can be heard hooting in the background. “I’m worried that my children will no longer be able to enjoy this,” he says. “The beauty of this local nature reserve is that it’s unspoilt. It would be absolutely terrible if the E40 went ahead as I’m afraid we’re going to lose this river and it will just become a channel for ships.”Further downstream, the Pripyat glides into the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Despite being the “worst nuclear disaster in history”, the official death toll is 54. Researchers believe the actual number could be as high as 200,000. Sizeable amounts of radioactive contamination fell far from the exclusion zone and thousands of deaths have not been properly investigated.Polesia experienced a spike in cancers and birth defects following the disaster – the “Belarusian necklace” refers to the horizontal scar after surgery for thyroid cancer. Some estimates suggest one in five people in Belarus still live on contaminated land. Poor people have the greatest exposure to radiation because they eat locally sourced food such as wild mushrooms, berries and milk.However, for many people life carries on as normal. “Because radiation is invisible no one was scared of it. I went to the 1 May parades after the explosion and had no idea it had happened. We still have very little information – the only bits I get are from the TV,” says Siarhei Stasienok, 65, a retired policeman who lives with his sister Tatiana, 64, in Kalinichy, just outside the exclusion zone.“I was happy with Chernobyl and it would have been nice if it had exploded 10 or 20 years earlier. Everything was polluted after the explosion and money was put into the village to get better roads and clean water. We got new fences and there was generally a lot of investment in the village.”Stasienok has a 3D portrait of Lenin on the outside his house. Inside, doilies cover the windows and an old-fashioned rotary dial telephone sits on the windowsill. There is still no running water.Before Chernobyl there were 100 people living in Kalinichy, now there are 10. “People have been dying in this village but not until a few years after the explosion. We don’t know if they were killed by the radiation because doctors are not allowed to officially put cancer on death certificates,” he says. When someone dies their house is destroyed to prevent others moving in.Stasienok had heard about the E40 plans but didn’t know much more than that. “I only believe things I can see,” he says.Down the road from Stasienok’s house is the village of Smalehau, which had such high levels of radiation the entire place was wrapped in plastic and buried. Only the road down the middle and the graveyard at one end remain. Former residents are only allowed to return in a coffin.Soviet experts have long maintained there is no need to further study the effects of radiation in this area, but many international scientists say we still know very little about it. Prof Wladimir Wertelecki, of the University of South Alabama, who has been studying birth defects in northern Polesia since 2000, says: “It is fundamental to study the rivers. Nothing is known without that. Dredging will stir up nucleoids that have been concentrated in the silt for decades. Radiation is not only airborne, rainborne and windborne but also waterborne.”Kate Brown, a specialist in nuclear history from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future, describes Polesia as a “layered toxic landscape”. She agrees there are likely to be high levels of radiation at the bottom of the river. “Part of the reason radioactivity in that region keeps getting suspended is because it’s a floody, swampy terrain. That was a wonderful ecological system in the past because it fertilised the pasture every year. Now what it does is that it re-suspends radioactivity in the soils,” she says.The International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended that the Kyiv reservoir remains undisturbed.Brown adds: “The zone of exclusion should stay a zone of exclusion as it was designed. We have such impatience these are long-lived contaminants, but we want everything to decay on a normal biological timescale.”Despite these concerns, discussions around E40 have been going on since 2013 and are now gaining momentum. Ukrainian and Belarusian government officials have agreed to start dredging the Dnieper and Pripyat rivers.Speaking at a press conference in Minsk last September, the Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the Dnieper-Pripyat waterway could become an important part of the E40, which would essentially give Belarus access to the Black Sea. In Kyiv in the same month, Ukraine’s prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, said the project was “absolutely real” and ready to be implemented. Ten million UAH (£315,000) has been allocated to dredge 64.5km of the Pripyat river in Ukraine, according to the minister of infrastructure, Vladislav Krikli.Official documents suggest the Polish government has requested investment through China’s “belt and road” initiative, although it is not known if it has been granted.The waterway will have a direct impact on more than 70 wildlife reserves. In Poland, the waterway will pass through Natura 2000 sites, which are protected under EU law. As a result, the feasibility study suggests a canal should be built adjacent to the river Bug this is the most expensive part of the project. However, such attempts at mitigation are not afforded to reserves in Belarus and Ukraine.“For me the E40 project is similar to a project on turning northern rivers to southern deserts: idends to a small group of developers and builders and irreversible consequences for the wildlife in Polesia will take place. Some of the local inhabitants will get jobs at the E40 but most will suffer from the artificial changes in the region’s ecosystems,” says Vintchevski.Maasikas said the waterway would have “devastating consequences” for ecosystems in all three countries and would result in a “critical loss of bioersity”. Economically, he said, the project (with an estimated cost of more than €12bn) was “unsound” and posed a serious threat of secondary radioactive pollution. He also criticised the feasibility study for ignoring the issue of climate change, which makes the construction of new waterways “unjustified and uneconomical”, especially given the E40 would need to be at least 2.5 metres deep along its entire route.Without EU financing Poland, Ukraine and Belarus are now looking to implement the project in inidual sections. Maasikas raised concerns that fragments of E40 infrastructure were being developed “as if the project was already approved by all interested parties and supported by the public”.When APB-BirdLife conservationists requested a meeting with the Belarusian ministry of transport and communications to discuss the environmental implications of the E40, deputy minister Natalia Alexandrovich said there was nothing to discuss because no decisions had been made.Przemysław Daca, the head of the Polish State Water Enterprise, says that the E40 would be a “pro-environment” development. “Waterborne transport is environmentally friendly, reduces CO2 emissions and other gases and particulates in the air. It also reduces noise emissions, the number of vehicles on roads and thus the number of road accidents.” Ministers in Ukraine and Belarus declined the ’s request for comment.Ivan Shchadranok, director of a sustainable development NGO Interakcia Foundation, which has lobbied for the E40 since the beginning, acknowledged that there has not been an adequate survey of the environmental implications of the project. However, he does not think the impact of the waterway would be as dramatic as some environment NGOs seem to think. “As a member of the cross-border commission I always tried to involve environmentalists in the creation of the feasibility study … Environmentalists are against such a study as they consider it as the first step to approval of the E40 restoration. So the situation is quite complicated,” he says.Shchadranok believes there should be scientific research on the waterway before dredging starts but he thinks this is unlikely and environmental issues will continue to be overlooked. “Without a highly credible and accurate environmental assessment in place, environmental supporters have no leverage over those who are moving the E40 project forward now.”Shchadranok says the issue of radioactive contamination is considered “quite serious by some water experts” but that he does not have the expertise to comment further.Researchers from FZS are now rushing to help officials in Belarus and Ukraine have Polesia declared a Unesco world heritage site on account of its bioersity. They believe it is in the same league as Yellowstone or Serengeti national parks.“Nobody cared about protecting the Pripyat until someone outside the country said it was important,” says Vintchevski, who is working with FZS to get the project stopped. “We have been living next to something extraordinary without even noticing. Polesia is special, but few people saw it like that and now it could be too late.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d988f54a2bd5dc5288b763970fa012509bb3ef4c/0_81_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38d406bd9b2bf565dd605462cf7da42c","title":"worrying keep coronavirus in perspective","story":"Ever the optimist, the Upside looks for silver linings to the global health scareThe most annoying question news anchors ask their correspondents is: “How worried should we be?” Not just because worry is hard to quantify (“er, very”?) not just because it’s a leading question.But because the answer should always be: “We shouldn’t worry at all. Worry is pointless. There is bound to be something better that we can do.”Indeed, psychotherapists might go on to say that if we are eaten up with worry, we should ask ourselves about the worrisome thoughts we are having: are they actually true? And are they helpful to us? If the answer to either is no, then worry is not serving us well.However serious a threat coronavirus poses, it’s important to retain perspective. More people die of tuberculosis each day – and of air pollution every five hours – than have succumbed in two months of Covid-19.If that game of morbid calculus is not exactly reassuring then try this: the vast majority of people who have had the illness have recovered. Children seem to be largely untouched. A vaccine is in the (admittedly fairly long) pipeline. We know where the illness came from, and the situation in that country is improving. The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic. You can kill it with antiseptic spray science is all over it clinical trials are under way.This is not to minimise what has happened, or predict what will. It is merely to keep a sense of proportion about coronavirus. There is no point succumbing to a fear pandemic before a disease pandemic has even taken hold. And besides, there have been a number of silver linings. Experts are back. Emissions are down. Personal hygiene has had a much needed overhaul …Otherwise, this week was all about Europe.

We are doubling down on European journalism, trying to get under the skin of issues that affect the whole continent – and, yes, hunting down solutions.

According to the webpage: “Public Health England (PHE) will publish data by upper tier local authority, one day in arrears, to allow local public health and health colleagues to plan their services.”So far no single authority has any more than four cases, with the specific number obscured. But it will be worth checking back as the outbreak develops to see which areas become hotspots. A fifth patient has died from Covid-19 in Spain as the number of people infected with coronavirus rose overnight by 102 case to 365, according to the country’s health officials. All the victims so far in the country have been people in high-risk categories, elderly or suffering from a pre-existing condition, AFP quoted Fernando Simon of the Spanish health ministry as saying. Madrid and the surrounding area has the highest concentration of cases, at 137, after health officials found clusters at two elderly care centres. Both have since been closed. Spain reported its first Covid-19 death on Tuesday, although the victim had died weeks earlier, on 13 February, with the illness diagnosed only as a result of a postmortem examination. The number of cases in Germany have climbed to 600 by 3pm local time, reports Kate Connolly in Berlin. So far there have been no deaths, while 16 people have recovered, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the foremost advisory body to the German government on health and safety issues. At 7am this morning there had been 534 confirmed cases.The government’s announcement that it is to ban the export of its protective clothing including masks, gloves and medical overalls, is being examined closely by officials at the European commission in Brussels, according to a commission spokeswoman, who said the move was being treated with “special urgency”. According to EU rules, member states have the right to restrict exports within the single market under certain circumstances, including public health concerns. Belgium’s health minister, Maggie De Block, was highly critical of Germany’s decision, telling a meeting of her EU colleagues in Brussels that “this is not in the spirit of the EU” and calling for more solidarity, according to German media.Thieves in Germany have been stealing protective masks as well as disinfectant, from trains, hospitals, hotels and public toilets, according to media reports. Large quantities of disinfectant and masks were also stolen from a children’s cancer ward at the Berlin hospital Charité. A workshop for people with disabilities has been training its employees to make the masks to try to meet demand. “We tried out a couple. Now we’ve got the hang of it, we’re turning out as many as we can, we’ve made 100 so far,” Julie Bloedorn of the Workshop Altnoythe in Cloppenburg said.Most German protective masks are imported from China, which has halted the export of them to Germany because of high domestic demand.It has been reported that a 24-year-old German who has an online fancy dress shop has made a small fortune, buying up masks from other countries including Poland and China before the growth of the virus, and selling them on for a tidy profit.The number of cases in Greece have also jumped today with the health ministry confirming coronavirus had been detected in 15 people – up from 31 on Thursday, reports Helena Smith in Athens. On Monday, the figure was eight. The new cases could be traced to a pilgrimage taken by a group of travellers to Israel and Egypt – bar three described as people they had come in contact with, the health ministry spokesman, Sotiris Tsiodras, told reporters. A 65-year-old man who had also attended the trip, and with whom all 21 of yesterday’s new infections were connected, was in serious condition in a hospital in the western port city of Patras, Tsiodras said. With the continued rise in infections, Greek authorities announced they would extend containment policies in three western regions – Achaia, Ileia and the island of Zakynthos – for another two weeks to try to prevent the outbreak spreading to other parts of the country.In an unprecedented step on Thursday, the government announced it was shutting all schools, cancelling sports events and prohibiting large public gatherings in the regions. Organised tours to and from the areas have also been shelved. Given the spread of infections across Europe, the health ministry says a ban on school trips abroad will also be prolonged until at least the middle of the month. The US president just reiterated his lack of concern about the spread of the novel illness in the US, reports Joanna Walters on our US politics liveblog. Perhaps problematic, though is that, to many he’s coming across as casually dismissive and posturing, not measured, and reassuringly presidential.“You have to be calm,” he said at the White House this morning before departing to tour the tornado damage in Tennessee and shortly after signing an $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus.“In terms of cases, it’s very very few because we have been very strong at the borders.”He also said he thinks the financial markets will “really bounce back” from the see-sawing of recent days over concerns that the virus is spreading and on governments’ abilities to contain it.“This came unexpectedly, it came out of China, we closed it down, we stopped it, it was a very early shutdown,” he added.There has been no official evidence provided to date that the novel coronavirus illness Covid-19 has been “shut down” in the US.Hello, this is Damien Gayle taking over the liveblog - with thanks to Sarah Marsh for keeping us updated with the developments in the global coronavirus outbreak throughout the day.

The men are based at Heathrow airport, west London. A spokesman for the airline said: “Public Health England has confirmed that two members of our staff have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus. The colleagues have been isolated and are recovering at home.”Baggage handlers work in teams and are responsible for loading, unloading and transporting luggage at airports. They do not generally have any interaction with passengers. British Airways is one of many airlines that has offered unpaid leave to their employees, amid a drop in passenger demand due to the coronavirus outbreak.It has cancelled hundreds of flights on routes to New York and short-haul destinations across Europe.The airline said in a statement: “We continue to closely monitor the situation, and as a precaution we are taking steps to control the costs in our business.”The west African country of Togo has registered its first case of coronavirus, its government said on Friday.The patient is a 42-year-old female resident of the capital, Lome, who had visited Benin, Germany, France and Turkey in late February and early March.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4194400.1583437146!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus hundreds of irish cases expected within fortnight","story":"The World Health Organisation has warned governments that this is not a drill as  coronavirus infections near 100,000 worldwide. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn emergency department nurse during a demonstration of the coronavirus pod and Covid-19 virus testing procedures at Antrim Area Hospital.

It followed another case confirmed in Northern Ireland earlier in the week.The teenager had become ill after returning from Italy and was placed in isolation in a Dublin hospital.Sunday, March 1stA north Dublin school with 400 pupils announced on Sunday it would close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus. Public health officials order the closure as a precautionary measure and to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.Tuesday, March 3rdThe second case of the coronavirus in the Republic was confirmed on Tuesday evening after a woman who had recently travelled from Italy tested positive.Wednesday, March 4thOn Wednesday, it was confirmed that a family of four in Co Clare had tested positive for the virus after returning from a skiing holiday in northern Italy.One of the family members, a healthcare professional, had worked in University Hospital Limerick’s emergency department before being diagnosed nine days after returning from the holiday. Efforts to trace people who came into contact with the four people are ongoing.These include patients who attended the minor injuries zone of the hospital’s emergency department between 10am and 2pm on Wednesday, February 26th.The hospital closed for three hours on Wednesday for a deep clean and patients were directed to other hospitals.These cases, the first cluster of positive tests in the Republic, forced the closure of three schools in Co Clare as a precautionary measure.Northern Ireland also reported two new cases on Wednesday, one of them a student from Queen’s University, bringing to three the total number of cases in the North. Neither of the two new cases in the North involved travel through the Republic.One of those who tested positive had travelled from northern Italy while the other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who had subsequently tested positive for Covid-19, said the North’s health minister Robin Swann.Thursday, March 5thOn Thursday evening, the Provost of Trinity College Dublin sent an email to its 17,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students and about 2,600 staff members informing them that a positive case of Covid-19 had been confirmed “within” the university.Another three new cases of the virus were confirmed among men from the east of the country who had recently travelled from Italy.Two women who were connected to the cases reported in Co Clare earlier in the week also tested positive.A man who had been in Cork University Hospital (CUH) for up to a week was also diagnosed. It is understood the man, who received treatment in the hospital last week and was discharged, may have had contact with a large number of staff and sick patients before he was tested. However, it is not clear how he came into contact with the virus.CUH has cancelled elective surgeries and imposed visitor restrictions along with the clearance of further space for isolating patients.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The In the middle of a national health crisis no less, a senior politician currently contesting his party’s leadership was clearly observed doing the Hucklebuck on the Leinster House plinth.Alan Kelly, what were you at? The man who hopes to take over from Brendan Howlin as Labour leader was utterly unapologetic.Alan was acting on warnings to avoid handshaking while the coronavirus threat is active. Fist-bump, elbow-rub, foot-shake – there are other ways for politicians to remain hands-on without extending their germ-riddled appendages.He hailed passing Senator Diarmuid Wilson and tried out a few of his new moves. Diarmuid proffered a hand, Alan feinted to the right and then brandished a knee. Very effective.If a little worrying. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, his leadership rival, will have to go one better now. He’ll probably head-butt a nun. The two contenders are shadowing each other everywhere during the campaign in a sickening display of fraternal conviviality.True to form, they sat side-by-side in the Dáil chamber when business temporarily resumed in the absence of a new government to discuss the recent European Council meeting and the continuing threat posed by Covid-19. The party leaders said their bit during the Order of Business.Speakers included Brendan Howlin, outgoing Labour leader. As contributions drew to a close, one of the men who wants his job chanced his arm and tried to speak. He caught the Ceann Comhairle’s eye.“Deputy Alan Kelly, you’re offering. Sorry, I can’t take you because this is only for party leaders and you’re not at this time leader of the Labour Party.” Aodhán snapped to attention. “Same applies to you, deputy Ó Ríordáin” added Seán Ó Fearghaíl. When it was announced that the Dáil would take the time it was not using to elect a new Taoiseach to discuss the virus, a grateful nation heaved a sigh of relief. Salvation was at hand.Not only was it the only subject on the Order of Business, but more than 2½ hours were set aside later in the evening for statements on the issue. It was a long slog.By two hours in and the maiden speech of Verona Murphy, the urge to self-isolate had gone far beyond the realm of the virus. The independent TD from Wexford completely ignored the designated topic and spoke about her election, the economy and the state of the building industry.Twice, the Ceann Comhairle had to ask her to finish as she was over her allotted time. At the tail end of her irrelevant speech, Verona threw in a couple of throwaway lines on the virus and sat down.On the plus side, after a day of talking, we can be confident that our politicians are virus-ready. At this worrying time in Leinster House, Independent TD Catherine Connolly spoke for almost everyone.“I welcome the fact we are not forming another committee.” It’s bad enough living under the threat of a viral pandemic without a special Dáil talking-shop blundering in and making things worse. The vast majority of TDs agreed. Brendan Howlin was the exception.In his book, there is nothing which cannot be considerably enhanced by the addition of an all-party Oireachtas committee. “I am strongly of the view that this is necessary,” he declared, particularly because we are in “the unusual situation of an interregnum”.What will happen if significant policy decisions have to be made? Who will provide “political underpinning of the legitimacy” of these decisions? He was referring to Leo Varadkar’s caretaker Government, which is neither here nor there in the context of the general election result but is still, crucially, in power.Words are very important in these anxious days when people are feeling personally vulnerable and very apprehensive about the future.The acting Taoiseach, who is a medical doctor, explained what we really need to know. “It is worth reminding the House that under the Constitution the Government continues until a new one is elected. The terms ‘caretaker’ or ‘acting’ are not used.” The very thought of it.He is a Trinity graduate. You won’t see Leo Varadkar in a brown shopcoat, toting a sweeping brush. How dare they.Until whenever, Leo stressed he remains in charge. But he’s not the boss of Mary Lou McDonald or Micheál Martin anymore.The Sinn Féin leader made it clear that the other main parties must not “be left as an afterthought” when decisions about the coronavirus strategy are considered.The Taoiseach (he’s no caretaker) readily agreed with Mary Lou. “I am happy to give exactly that assurance.”The Fianna Fáil leader was in favour of some sort of committee, but is happy with “a mechanism” allowing public representatives, for example, to have access to information which will help them answer questions from the public.“The psychology of a public health scare is at times as important as the scare itself” Micheál said. His TDs have discovered that when the virus is connected with their locality, “basically the phone explodes.”Social Democrat Róisín Shorthall provided some helpful information. The Business Committee met earlier on this committee business and decided it was not a good idea to establish a new one to monitor the situation. There is no point in dragging senior public health officials into Kildare Street to answer questions when they are needed at the coalface.Briefing sessions should suffice. If emergency legislation is needed, she has “no doubt that all members will make themselves available to return here at short notice”.Catherine Connolly wanted to talk about context. Primary care facilities are being closed at an “unprecedented” rate in the west of Ireland, said the Galway-based TD. “We have a current crisis. There are major closures planned in primary care and we are talking about capacity in relation to this virus. We really want to get real and put it in perspective. There is a crisis as is.”This time, though, the chequebook is coming out. The Taoiseach said money over and above the HSE’s budget for this year will be available to fund whatever actions are needed to fight the virus. Closed intensive care units are to be opened up and extra beds will be made available. Because you see, people are dying all the time but this is different.“The HSE has been given the green light to use additional resources, staff and financial, as needed, so that we are able to contain Covid-19 for as long as we can.”Richard Boyd Barrett had a helpful suggestion. As this is a crisis, there should be no “two-tier system” in operation.

Photograph: Francois WalschaertsAFP via Getty ImagesIt will be tough to reach a deal between the European Union and Britain to govern their post-Brexit relationship but it can be done, negotiators said after the first round of talks concluded on Thursday.“To be completely frank with you there are many ergences ... and they are very serious ergences,” said the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. “I think, sincerely, that the agreement is possible, even if difficult.” A UK official close to the talks said the sides were far apart on issues of fishing rights, on what governance system could resolve disputes, and on the so-called level playing field. “Basically it’s going to be tough but it’s just the first round. Overall it was constructive,” said the UK official. “Our vision is of a trade relationship between sovereign equals.”Mr Barnier stressed that irrespective of whether a deal was reached, Britain’s decision to leave the single market and customs union meant that big changes lay ahead for trade on January 1st, 2021. All goods imported or exported between the EU and Britain would be subject to customs formalities, UK financial firms would lose their passporting rights to sell across the EU, and UK certification of goods would no longer be valid in the bloc.“It will not be business as usual ... it will be very very different,” Mr Barnier said. “The difficulties that will be linked to that, my impression is that they are still very often underestimated.”Britain hopes to achieve a free-trade deal with the European Union that allows it to export easily into the world’s largest economic bloc.The EU says free access to its single market can only be granted if the UK aligns with EU norms, in order to avoid giving its companies an unfair competitive advantage, something Britain has rejected since agreeing to it in principle last year. Prime minister Boris Johnson’s government now argues that erging from EU norms, or at least the freedom to do so, is the entire point of Brexit. This rules out the close trade relationship pursued by his predecessor Theresa May. Customs checksMr Johnson secured Britain’s leeway to sharply erge from EU norms in the withdrawal agreement of last year, which guaranteed Northern Ireland would remain in line with the EU as a default, in order to avoid a land border.This entails that checks and customs formalities will take place between Northern Ireland and Britain.The EU has made the future relationship agreement contingent on the implementation of that deal, and chief UK negotiator David Frost has assured Brussels that Britain will uphold its commitments.The practicalities of what this means for trade between Northern Ireland and Britain is to be studied by a joint EU-UK committee, which will meet for the first time on March 30th.Businesses in the North, which are strongly reliant on easy trade both across the sea with Britain and with the Republic, have appealed for clarity on what the arrangements will be.“Business likes certainty and at the moment we don’t have that,” said Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium. “It needs to be something that’s deliverable in the nine months we have available.”Britain is in a transitional arrangement until December 31st, continuing to follow prior norms. There will be four more rounds of negotiations in Brussels and London before May. UK negotiators say if they judge insufficient progress has been made by June, they will abandon talks to prepare for a no deal scenario. In that case, World Trade Organisation default tarriffs would apply to imports and exports between the EU and UK from January 1st, delivering an even greater jolt to trade than if a deal is reached.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It’s difficult to know where to startThe Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, didn’t beat around the bush in his first major speech yesterday. He said the BBC must do more to reflect the country and avoid providing a “narrow urban outlook”. There must be genuine ersity of thought, he added. In other words, the BBC is a London-centric, liberal-minded broadcaster that is no longer in touch with the public.Many people would consider that to be stating the obvious. The BBC is in serious trouble. It is losing viewers and listeners in their thousands to online streaming services and to commercial rivals. It is feeling “got at” by the Government. In his role as lightning rod for the Prime Minister, Dominic Cummings has seen fit to ban ministers from going on various BBC programmes, including Radio 4’s flagship Today, because of anti-Tory bias. It is a bias that hasn’t escaped the notice of some viewers and listeners, either.And yet the BBC’s response has not been to reflect, but largely to double-down, repeating its usual mantras about the good value offered by the license fee. If the broadcaster was in a healthy state, it wouldn’t need to be told by a politician to think outside the metropolitan, liberal box.So how out of touch is the BBC? It’s difficult to know where to start. Most obviously, it failed to gauge the public mood on Brexit, constantly obsessing about a second referendum and only paying lip-service to those who gently pointed out that the demand for one didn’t really exist outside Remain-supporting London – coincidentally where most BBC producers and editors live. It even sought to “correct” the views of Brexiteers, with its “Reality Check” journalists, a service that was rarely performed on claims made by Remainers.The election result, therefore, came as an almost total surprise. To be fair, the BBC wasn’t alone in not seeing the Boris majority coming a mile off, but its reaction showed little understanding of what brought it about. Indeed, it was partly the BBC which brought it about. It has consistently struggled to reflect the public’s views on touchstone issues like crime and immigration, which it views as deeply reactionary.Its London-centricity is best illustrated by the Today programme. It regards getting out of London once a month to broadcast from a top tier university as somehow being enough to reflect the mood of the country. Why does it never broadcast from a factory or a call centre?Then consider the BBC’s obsession with going on about what we now are obliged to refer to as the “climate emergency”. Preaching to us all about how terrible we are for the lifestyles we lead does little to endear the broadcaster to its non-Islington audience. Radio 4’s token doff of its cap to its audience is to provide a whole half an hour, yes, 30 minutes, to hearing the views of listeners on Any Answers. Perhaps if it became more like LBC and had a daily phone-in show, it might realise where it’s going wrong.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisThe BBC, however, does not seem very interested in local opinion. It is set, for example, on turning its so-called “local” radio stations into carbon copies of each other. In the last few months they’ve all been given identical jingles with the universal strapline of “All the music you love…”.It is also panicking about losing young viewers and listeners, while failing to see that other demographics will not remain loyal forever. To take one example, BBC Radio London is turning its 10pm-1am phone-in into a youth-oriented music show. BBC Radio London has long been a basket case of a station, yet its controller has mysteriously clung onto his job for more than 20 years. Maybe it’s the unique way the BBC is funded. For now, anyway.I want the BBC to succeed. I admire a lot of what it does. But it is threatening to turn in on itself. It’s being held back by an institutionalised management more interested in covering their own backs than promoting innovation and giving viewers and listeners what they want.The battle for eyeballs and ears has never been more cutthroat, and if the BBC fails to acknowledge that it has no ine right to exist in its current form, there will be further trouble ahead.Iain Dale is an LBC presenter.

The 27-page document sets out the UK-wide response, with possible measures including the cancellation of non-urgent operations and retired NHS staff being called back to duty.The \u0027s map below plots where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK. It is sourced from Public Health England announcements and will be updated regularly based on trustworthy data.On Wednesday, Public Health England confirmed 36 new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK.And on Friday the Department for Heath and Social Care said an additional 47 patients had been infected - the largest single day rise to date - bringing the total across the UK to 163.Of those located in England, the largest number has been detected in London, with 29 cases recorded in the capital.Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said 29 of the new cases this week had travelled from recognised countries or clusters under investigation.He said three contracted the virus in the UK, but it was not yet clear if they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone returning from abroad. An elderly patient with underlying health conditions was the first person to die in the UK having been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to the Royal Berkshire NHS Trust.A second death was confirmed on Friday.The unnamed patient in his 80s is thought to have succumbed to COVID-19 on Thursday night while being treated at Milton Keynes, Hospital, Bucks.Prof Whitty said all UK cases were being investigated and contact tracing has begun.He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do extreme things to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions in the event of a UK epidemic.He said the NHS would cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic.He said: For the great majority of people this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days rather like with mild flu.And there are some people who will get it with no symptoms at all, but for a minority of people - and this is particular in people who are older people or people with pre-existing health conditions - the risk is higher.The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, then it will put very high pressure on the NHS and there could be several weeks which could be very difficult for the health service and wider society.Prof Whitty said he believes there is now onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - although only two cases of this nature have been identified so far. Mitigation efforts in the UK will be driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 and fall into four main areas:At the end of December, the Chinese authorities sent out a public alert warning that a pneumonia of unknown cause had been identified in Wuhan, central China.Some 10 days later, on Jan 7, scientists announced that a new coronavirus was the source of the outbreak – quickly adding that it did not appear to be spreading between humans. At that point, fewer than 60 cases had been found. But now the virus, which has since been named Covid-19, has spread to well over 70 countries, infecting more than 93,000 people and killing nearly 3,200. Scientists believe that the virus has mutated into two strains: the older ‘S-type’ appears to be milder and less infectious, while the ‘L-type’ which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. This map, which updates automatically, shows where the disease is now, how many cases there have been and how many people have died: More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"taiwan sets gold standard epidemic response keep infection rates","story":"Taiwan sits just 81 miles from the coast of China, more than 800,000 of its citizens live there and hundreds of daily connecting flights normally service business travel and tourism, but it has defied predictions of a widespread coronavirus outbreak and kept infection rates to just 44 isolated cases. As nearby Japan and South Korea reel with thousands of infections, experts say Taiwan, an island of 23 million, has kept the virus at bay through early intervention, a slick command structure, well-rehearsed epidemic strategy and transparent communication that other countries including the UK could learn from. By late December, before the coronavirus was on the world’s radar, Taiwan’s government was already sensing danger from rumours of a new respiratory disease emerging from Wuhan, and officials began boarding flights to check the health of passengers from the Chinese city. Taipei began to block flights from China and quarantine people from infected zones before other Asian capitals chose to do so, and Taiwan’s Centres for Disease Control issue daily updates and regular warnings about the locations infected Covid-19 patients visited before their diagnosis. Public buildings including schools, malls and office blocks require anyone entering to disinfect their hands, and the government quickly averted panic over a face mask shortage with rationing an official stockpile of 44 million masks that ensured a steady flow to the public. Audrey Tang, the digital minister, topped the strategy with an online tracing system that allows people to search for pharmacies that have remaining stock, to avoid queuing in vain. Taiwan’s alertness and expertise were borne out of the trauma of the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) that ravaged the island in 2003, and out of a deep mistrust of China and the World Health Organisation who, senior officials claim, delayed vital assistance to counter the disease. China claims the island, which functions like any other democratic nation, as its own territory which it intends to annex. Beijing has pressured international forums, including the WHO, to exclude Taiwan, claiming it has no right to forge independent diplomatic ties. In the case of epidemic disease control, Taiwan argues this policy endangers lives. On the plus side, it has forced the authorities to gameplan robust self-protection measures. He added: “The establishment of the national health command centre was really critical. It’s like a little compound where all the information comes from local and central government and it all gets integrated. You get the data, process it and then you can tell people what’s going on.”In a paper published by the Journal of the American Medical Association this week, Professor Wang and co-author Robert Brook, a professor of medicine, praised Taiwan’s response, highlighting its use of big data, new technology and pro-active testing of patients with severe respiratory difficulties.  Taiwan combined tight border control from the air and sea with swift identification and quarantine of suspicious cases.  National health and immigration information was integrated to track iniduals at high risk because of recent travel to affected areas and their home quarantine was monitored through their phones. Meanwhile, a hotline was set up in each major city for citizens to report suspicious symptoms. “Through early recognition of the crisis, daily briefings to the public, and simple health messaging, the government was able to reassure the public by delivering timely, accurate, and transparent information regarding the evolving epidemic,” they concluded. “Taiwan is an example of how a society can respond quickly to a crisis and protect the interests of its citizens.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/05/19/container.jpg","title":"coronavirus business impact britain no deal brexit","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.While large multinationals may be able to ride out the economic turmoil on the horizon, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspBen Chapman reportsBritish manufacturers say they are summoning up the “wartime spirit” to deal with anticipated staff shortages and supply disruption caused by the coronavirus.But for some, the major concern is a short, deep shock from the outbreak followed by the longer, more drawn-out pain of a hard Brexit.While large multinationals may be able to ride out those twin problems, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government warned this week that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick at the height of the Covid-19 epidemic, a scenario that would present serious problems for manufacturers.“We may have a few people off or we may be decimated,” says Donald Pow, a manager at Allied Vehicles Group in Glasgow.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitAround 250 of Allied’s 670 staff work in manufacturing, mostly in Glasgow. They operate 15 stages of a production line which transforms ordinary vehicles to make them accessible for people with disabilitiesWorkers at each stage have specialised expertise which can’t necessarily be replaced if significant numbers are off work. Clearly working from home is not an option.“It’s very difficult. We can move people from other parts of the business but at some point we would not be running efficiently,” says Pow. “We’re not just going to shut our doors and say, ‘Things are a bit difficult, let’s stop working.’\u0026nbspThere’s a bit of that wartime spirit.”For Allied, Brexit, and the\u0026nbspuncertainty over what it will entail, represent bigger concerns than the virus, says Pow –\u0026nbspat least for now.The company exports vehicles to countries across western Europe. It is already concerned about tariffs and the effect of a highly uncertain future. “Brexit is affecting both the reality of our business and our customers’ confidence,” says Pow, who is concerned the company will be less competitive in future with rivals based inside the EU.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Costs have shot up around 15 per cent so far as the company struggles to find enough ships to transport its products, says commercial manager\u0026nbspJohn Stephenson.\u0026nbspTudor Rose is losing sales as ships stay stuck in Chinese ports, causing a major backlog in the key arteries of world trade.\u0026nbspWith many Chinese factories shut down to contain the virus’s spread, there is much less to ship and so freight companies have cancelled sailings. That leaves British firms facing a shortage of containers to put their goods into, pushing up prices.“It has an effect all along those routes via places like Mumbai and the Middle East,” says\u0026nbspStephenson.Shipping is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for economic shocks to come. With a vessel taking about a month to make its way from China to Europe, the sharp drop in activity in China is still working its way through.Stephenson estimates that there are about 100 fewer vessels on the global routes along which Tudor Rose ships its food and drink. That may not sound like a lot but each one is vast, carrying an average 20,000 containers.Two million fewer containers has a real impact, says Stephenson. “It’s already been quite pronounced.

The company anticipates some rebound in demand when the outbreak calms down but for the most part, sales lost now are likely to be lost for good.If Chinese ports open up fully again things will improve, but Tudor Rose fears there may be further shutdowns at other key points along the route as governments seek to contain the virus.“We are at the early stages of this.

To cover themselves for when unexpected and hugely damaging shocks like disease outbreaks hit?The UK government this week, under pressure from industry lobby groups, designated covid-19 a “notifiable disease”, in order to make it easier for affected companies to claim insurance.So can we expect an avalanche of claims and big losses for insurance companies as a result of this outbreak?Or are companies in for disappointment if they expect to be compensated for the economic damage wreaked by covid-19?It’s worth drawing a distinction between two broad categories of business insurance, say experts.First, there’s event cancellation insurance, which is a type generally offered by sophisticated insurance markets like Lloyd’s of London or major insurance conglomerates.Torsten Jeworrek of the German insurer Munich Re\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspReuters\u0026nbsplast month that his firm had provided cancellation insurance for the Tokyo games “in the hundreds of millions of euros”.Second, there’s the more general cover for “business interruption” offered to companies by smaller insurance firms.But if a firm is covered it’s covered, isn’t it?Not necessarily. It all depends on the wording of the inidual insurance contract.But it’s important to bear a broad principle in mind, namely that there’s a difference from the perspective of the insurance company between “definable” and “undefinable” risk.And insurance firms are unlikely to have written an insurance policy that covers a firm from the impact of an undefinable risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Think of a hotel that sees its bookings slump because people change their travel plans. Or a company that suffers because it’s staff don’t turn up to work because of illness.In any case, industry experts caution that “notifiable disease” clauses (the classification the UK government updated this week) are not standard in insurance contracts.“Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks, not those that are very unlikely, such as the effects of covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers.So what’s the bottom line: are insurers going to be hit hard or not?Crawford Forensic Accounting Services produced a report last month on the likely impact of coronavirus on the insurance sector.It concluded that “successful claims under business interruption coverage for infection are not common”.Crawford director Frederique Hardy also told The Independent that event cancellation insurance contracts tend to be very bespoke, making it difficult to generalise about the ability of event organisers to make claim.Yet the general view of the industry – at the moment – is that coronavirus is unlikely to result in an explosion of costly payouts.If that’s correct it points to a lot of disappointed firms.And, as a by product, it’s likely to increase further the pressure on governments to give stressed companies economic relief in the form of more time to pay tax and perhaps forbearance on debt repayments to banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Since those stars have been used to track the history of the universe as it expands, our measurement of fundamental processes such as the Hubble constant and the amount of dark matter\u0026nbspcould be wrong\u0026nbsptoo, scientists have said.The new findings come from a team of astronomers led by Maria Bergemann\u0026nbspfrom the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy. They measured the chemical make-up of stars and came upon unexpected results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAstronomers had previously believed that a specific kind of supernova – known as “type Ia” – usually came about when a white dwarf orbited around a normal star and pulled away its outer layers. However, new measurements show that they largely come from other scenarios.That, in turn, suggests that we may be wrong in our understanding of how bright such stars can be, how the brightness changes over time, and how long they can stay bright. In the other kinds of explosions, the brightness is not as neatly constrained, and so we cannot know as definitively how bright a star should appear.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It has underwritten work that helped suggest that our universe is made up of about 70 per cent dark energy, and the measurement of the Hubble constant, or the speed at which our universe is expanding.In some ways, the new measurements might prove useful to scientists. It could help explain the apparent discrepancy in the Hubble constant, which has arisen as scientists have found that different measurements – some using type Ia supernovae and others looking at the universe through the cosmic microwave background – do not match up.Further work is expected to help check the new findings against observations of other parts of the universe. One important test could be the third data release from the European Space Agency’s Gaia programme, which will come next year.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within an hour, I was heading up Interstate 5 to Everett, to talk to health officials and get reactions from residents. (Summation of interviews: Not concerned. Trying to stay calm.)Six weeks later, the nation’s first fatality was reported in the suburb of Kirkland. This time it was a dash northwest on Interstate 405 to talk to people stocking in a supermarket close to the hospital where the person had died and where the LifeCare Centre nursing home was located. (Summation of interviews: Increasingly concerned. Trying to calm, but anxious.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow the death toll has reached 11. More than 100,000 employees of companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook, among them my wife, have been told to work from home to reduce the spread of the virus. \u0026nbspResidents over the age of 60, or people with underlying health conditions, have also been advised to stay at home. Officials have ordered school districts to close. They have also suggested community groups cancel events involving more than ten people.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaImages from stores such a Costco show massive lines.

Mike Pence is visiting the state capital.And yet people in the neighhourhood coffee shop this morning appeared to display little concern. One customer, Lindsay Berger, who was chatting to two other women, said she was stunned by how people were “overreacting”.“It makes me worry what we’d do if there was a real crisis,” she said. She said friends in New York had sent her images of the Union Square branch of Whole Foods Market with the shelves bare.\u0026nbsp“This is contagious, but mild.

It feels an exercise in indulgence and privilege to report people’s concerns about whether to take a flight on their vacation. It hardly feels like a crisis if people can click a button to restock their food cupboard.\u0026nbspAs with so much of today’s world, privilege will likely emerge as a defining faultline as the coronavirus crisis plays out.If you have health insurance you know you can be treated if you fall ill. If you have a place to live, you can work from home, assuming you have a job. Unless, that is, you work in one of the warehouses filled with canned food, or are a delivery driver, or work in a coffee shop or fast-food restaurant.But what about the estimated 5,0000 of Seattle’s homeless, their plight worsened by the shortage in affordable housing those thousands of well-rewarded tech employees\u0026nbsphave helped to create?How do you get treatment for coronavirus if your home is a tent under the interstate, or next to a new construction?

You should beNot enough coronavirus tests to meet US demand, Pence admitsThis morning, many people in the area were jolted by a story in the New York Times that suggested in the six weeks between the first outbreak was reported\u0026nbspin Everett\u0026nbspto the first death, in Kirkland,\u0026nbspanywhere between from 150 to 1,500 people may have had, or contracted the disease.Mike Famulare, a principal research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modelling in Bellevue, said it was most likely 300 to 500.\u0026nbspThe most genuinely frightening thing is that people do not know where the virus is or who has been infected. Is it that person sneezing on the bus? What about that person walking their dogs?For reporters, the challenge is identifying the locus. What is the essence of the story we’re trying to cover?As health officials step up their testing, many cases will be reported. We are almost certainly likely to see more deaths. At some point, those numbers will start to reduce, but that may be some time away.A heartening comment came from a member of staff in that coffee shop this morning when I expressed some surprise to find it open. She said it had been “business as usual” but that “everybody is making an effort to be super friendly”.Was that the employees or the customers, I asked.

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds. So together they are . . .A right pain in the ar*e.Tala Gouveia is ambitious, no-nonsense DCI Lauren McDonald, who’s come down to Bath, from London, saying things like: “I’m here for two years, tops. Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other. We all want to be healthy and so much of that starts from being clean.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world. Very grateful, thank you. My le is enriched.It seems that Stace is getting tired of “trolls” telling her she’s not bringing up her kids right. Not dressing them in appropriate clothing and stuff.Can’t say I give a monkey’s one way or the other. But I’m not absolutely certain that the best way to convince people you’re an elegant and well-mannered young lady is to take a selfie while you’re laying a cable, you know And then there’s this. She’s annoyed with the trolls right now. But what about when they’ve all gone and started to annoy someone  Who will be left to look at those selfies  Apart from Stacey THERE’S outrage in Darlington over the plight of a bunch of hamsters found in a hedge. Locals are more disgusted than at any time since my band, Dangerbird, played there in .These hamsters were in plastic boxes. And one can only assume they were bred to feed snakes. They have now been liberated. So what are they going to feed the snakes Kale and mung bean risotto  I’m telling you, they won’t like that. The likely answer is mice.So why is that any better than feeding them their cousins, hamsters A spokesmouse for the British Association of Small Rodentstold me yesterday: “It’s ludicrous. Totally inconsistent.Hamsters get away with murder. Because they’ve got chubby little cheeks and are refugees from Syria.“But nobody cares about us mice. And at least we don’t spend half the bloody night running around on a wheel like a moron. Can’t stand hamsters, me.”Anyway, Bob’s half the size of Mount Everest and rushing towards us at nearly ,mph. The experts reckon it will just miss us. But they can’t be exactly sure. Bob could swing by to say hello. In which case you can wear as many face masks as you like but it won’t help you one bit.You can even follow the BBC’s excellent advice on “how to wash your hands”. .Bob won’t care.

Once inside the groups, we found some fact, some fiction - and plenty of panic, with one concerned woman even asking fellow members for advice on how best to disinfect a lettuce.Another posted: How can I prevent and prepare for the coronavirus  I am really scared.Offering advice, a so-called prepper, from London, urged: Go and stock up on tinned food, powdered milk, lighters, candles, health products, binbags, pet food, Dettol etc... we are with you.Psychotherapist Claire Goodwin-Fee explains how joining in panicked discussion about the coronavirus online could actually INCREASE your chance of contracting the illness.Claire, of The Therapy Couch, says: Anxiety around our children is very understandable and natural particularly when faced with illness or disease.However, it is important to remember that emotions are not facts and that is key in how we respond.Continuously watching reports around this or participating in debates online can create a larger sense of panic than necessary.We activate our fight or flight response which is literally a survival mechanism. One normally activatedthere is a serious threat to our le in that moment.The danger is that our brains do not know the dference between what is actually happening and what our thoughts are creating.When this system activates the front thinking part of our brain isn’t able to work properly and so we respond to stimulus, be it online or in conversation, asit is real and happening right now.This can lead to emotional overload, panic, anxiety and burnout.This can lead onto a mob rule mentality that is unhelpful and potentially dangerous.Another Brit revealed she had been left sick and shaking at the thought of her mum catching the virus - and suggested workers should take bottles of bleach to the office with them.Was slated last night on local town FB [Facebook] page, she wrote.I suggested we ALL do our bit by taking spray bleach to work  clean door handles, switched phones etc. Commuters to spray it on grab rails etc on trains  busses .Worryingly, some members were using the groups to seek medical advice for themselves and their families, rather than turning to a trained professional for guidance.Has anyone had pneumonia jab  one mum posted in the Coronavirus uk group, which has nearly  members. With the virus it causes pneumonia so would this not help Another asked: Would you go doctors to re new asthma pumps bit worried.With a soaring number of Brits being struck down with the virus, schools in the worst-hit areas of the country have been temporarily closed, including in Lincolnshire, Cheshire and the West Midlands.Yet with tens of thousands of schools still open, we found many users urging parents to remove their children from class entirely - or turn up at the gates at breaktime armed with wipes.One single dad posted: Just spoke to my sons school they say I will be fined and then took to courtI take my son out. I askedthe school can guarantee my sons safety concerning the virus.They said they cant give me  percent reassurance that hes going to be safe from it .In response, another user said: Keep your child off and say they have the s***s.A second agreed: I would not be sending my kids into school.On the CoronaVirus UK Updates page, which has more than , members, another dad admitted he thought he was being a freak when he pulled his kids from school and joined the group.It was humiliating to speak about to the schools and my family, he wrote, but added: After watching all the comments and posts today some are hysterical a lot worse than me.One mum on the page admitted she was scared to death about her children being at school.A couple of things were doing is giving them the antibacterial hand wash in them little reusable bottles, wrote the woman, from a suburban London town.Also putting  wipes in a sandwich bag to wipe over there desk and chair in each lesson .Its this panic that has led nearly  Brits to join a coronavirus home education Facebook group - including a primary school teacher whose son has a compromised immune system.Earlier this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a statement on the site, saying the company had been working with health authorities to coordinate its response to the virus outbreak.He said: Were focused on making sure everyone can access credible and accurate information. This is critical in any emergency, but its especially important when there are precautions you can take to reduce the risk of infection.If you search for coronavirus on Facebook, youll see a pop-up that directs you to the World Health Organization or your local health authority for the latest information.If youre in a country where the WHO has reported person-to-person transmission, youll also see it in your News Feed.He added: Were also focused on stopping hoaxes and harmful misinformation.And its not just schools that are worrying Brits - but workplaces, too.One married mum wrote in a group: My husband works in retail.There are cases in our area that are now emerging. Shops are being stripped. My husband has been told he cannot wear a mask as it will insight fear. Also to use sanitiser. His hands are now sore.We have decided that when he comes home he will strip off. Bag his clothes up and jump in the shower. His shoes will be Dettoled. But that doesnt stop him from being coughed on or sneezed on.While some workers have been told to work from home or have refused to come into the office at all, other Brits wont leave their homes due to anxiety over the virus.Im bleaching everything - even door handles, one mum tells Sun Online.Im spraying my carpet, sofa and bedding.Another woman, from Gloucestershire, was horried when her neighbour asked to borrow some of her  per cent alcohol hand sanitiser because she couldnt find any in the shops herself.I don’t have loads, what do I do  the woman posted on a Facebook group. I have spoken to her previously about my concerns about the virus and told her to stock up and she thought I was mad!Desperate to keep the virus at bay, some Brits are buying surgical masks and even Army-style respirators - with one UK supplier reporting to have sold  TIMES more than usual.Chris Whybro, of the eBay store Centurion Surplus, which sells Army surplus items, tells us: I usually sell approximately three to five a week which has gone to  a week since the start of the coronovirus outbreak. Wholesalers have sold out across Europe.Since  , Ive always kept a big stock but there’s never been as big a demand as right now - and this has lasted longer than the   aftermath.Some of the groups we investigated featured pictures of members posing in huge gas masks. Other users were spreading conspiracy theories linked to China - where the outbreak began - and G.Yet among the hysteria were more upbeat remarks.Discussing the first things they would do when the outbreak was over, the members of one UK group wrote: cry with joy, travel and go around licking door handles like I used to in the old days.And one mum even came up with some positives of two weeks lockdown.[Ill] see more of my man and baby, finally catch up on house work, get the grass cut, start some good habits of doing yoga in house exercise, do some DIY, she wrote.March  - The number of cases jumps to  - up from  earlier in the day.

Meghan and I are so happy to be back here with you, to celebrate your achievements, your service, and your resilience - and that of your families too.“For some, the military community represents a brotherhood or sisterhood that no other organisation can provide, and for others it’s a way of le which you never want to leave. For a lot of us, it’s both.“Being able to serve Queen and Country is something we all are rightly proud of, and it never leaves us. Once served, always serving!“Leaving the military and hanging up your unorm is - we know - an incredibly hard thing to do...unless of course it’s blue in colour.“But being forced to hang it up due to injury, beyond your control, can be even more dficult to accept.He added: “The Endeavour Fund came from seeing the gaping hole that can be left after taking off that unorm.Our ambition is to build on what has been achieved - to expand the Endeavour Fund further so that its impact can be felt around the world.For this reason, I am very pleased to announce that we are looking at opportunities to create a much closer working relationship with the Invictus Games Foundation.More will be announced in due time but it’s been made possible by the generous support of some specic people, so thank you.At the prestigious event, Meghan, , dazzled in a beautul blue Victoria Beckham dress, complete with cap sleeves and zip running all the way up the back.The vibrant dress was worn with a pair of £, navy-coloured suede Jimmy Choo £ shoes.The Duchess of Sussex was earlier today pictured smiling as she left The Goring Hotel in London ahead of her first royal engagement since quitting the Firm.In a chic camel coat and £ Aquazzura black heels, Meghan appeared in good spirits despite the tumultuous few weeks that saw her and Prince Harry move to Canada after their dramatic announcement they would become financially independent in January.Harry, , was spotted leaving the London hotel just moments after his we stepped out this afternoon.A smiling Harry wore a blue suit as he walked down the street as a concierge held an umbrella over his head to avoid the rain.Meghan Markle is reportedly “delighted” to be back in Britain, where she will fulfil her final official duties as a Royal, the Sun Online has learned.Our source said: “The last few weeks have done Meghan the power of good.She has a real spring in her step and is excited and honoured to be part of so many important events. She is particularly proud to be with Harry tonight at an event she knows means so much to him. And she is looking forward to marking Women’s Day, a cause which is very close to her heart.The source added: “Meghan has also loved Britain and there are lots of things she misses so the chance tois one she has been really looking forward to.Like any new mother she will of course miss her son, but both she and Harry are acutely aware of the scrutiny they are under following their decision and both want to fulfil the promises they have made to serve.”It is unclear whether the couple are staying at the hotel as they previously said they wanted to keep Frogmore Cottage in Windsor as their second home, even paying back the £.million of taxpayers cash spent on refurbishing the property.The Goring Hotel, which is the only hotel to be awarded a Royal Warrant for hospitality services, is just minutes from Buckingham Palace.The hotels entire top floor was previously booked out by the Middleton family ahead of Kates wedding to Prince William in . The Royal Suite itself costs £, a night.The Sun Online can reveal that both Meghan and Harry hope to see many of their close team and staff who are set to lose their jobs as part of their decision to quit Britain.The source explained that, “Harry and Meghan are both deeply aware of the fact that the decision they made would have an impact not just on them but on the people they work with.They are hoping over the next few days that they will see and personally thank many of the team they have worked with over the last couple of years.They have been loyal servants and totally dedicated to Harry and Meghan.And although many now face losing their jobs, they have always acted with dignity and shown respect to the dficult situation they now find themselves in.Prince Harry ed to the UK last week to begin his final round of royal engagements before the couple officially leave the Royal Family on March .And amid his final engagements, Prince Harry sat down with his grandmother the Queen for a heart to heart talk earlier this week.It is believed the -year-old monarch assured her grandson that he and Meghan would always have a place with the Royal Familythey changed their minds.And insiders said Prince Harry was feeling emotional as he approached his final round of royal engagements.At his first engagement back in the UK, the duke insisted just call me Harry as he appeared at an eco-tourism conference in Scotland.Meghan and Harry were last in the UK together in January before the terms of their Megxit were agreed.Part of the Megxit deal means Harry and Meghan wont be using the term Royal, meaning they will have to rename their SussexRoyal website and Instagram account.However, Harry will remain sixth-in-line to the throne and retain his HRH status - although he wont use it.He must also ditch his honorary military positions for at least  months before the Queen reviews the deal.As well as their appearance at the Endeavour Fund Awards at Mansion House, the couple will be at Saturday’s Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall.The Duchess will also see the Queen, Charles and Camilla and William and Kate for the first time since the split at Monday’s Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey.It will be the Sussexes’ final event as senior royals. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

But the Queen is nothingnot practical.She has learned the lessons of the unedying exits of Princess Diana and the Duchess of York from The Firm and won’t make the same mistake this time.That’s why she quite beautully told Harry:  “You are much loved and will always be welcomed back” — a line that brings tears to the eyes of a  soppy old monarchist like me.The Queen has not accepted that Megxit is permanent and probably never will. Harry needs some time away to explore and live a le where he isn’t playing second fiddle to his father and brother.Duty and the love of his country might just pull him back soon, she hopes.But perhaps the Queen hasn’t factored in the persuasiveness and passion of Meghan — a truly modern woman with very dferent plans for her husband and their “brand”.SOMETHING Kinda Woohoo as Girls Aloud fans like me got fresh hope this week.One of the main obstacles preventing the chart-topping band reuniting has been the feud between the lovely Nadine Coyle and some of the other members.But Kimberley Walsh met Nadine this week and they seemed to be getting along just fine. Of course, the real battle will be getting Cheryl Tweedy on board.Although with her last single peaking at No, I think she might be willing to kiss and make up with Nads too. As the Pussycat Dolls have proven, there’s nothing like an enormous cheque to help smooth over bitter relations.After all, a high-profile pregnancy and cute baby being born at No always lts our collective spirits, right Similar sentiments were expressed when Tony Blair and David Cameron said  their wives were expecting while PM.  The pregnancies of Kate and Meghan were widely celebrated, too.But we are  gripped by a nasty culture war driven by social media.So after the happy announcement, Twitter once again became a hateful cesspit where apparently respectable professionals found despicable ways to slag off a young woman expecting her first baby, to a man she loves, and spout pathetic conspiracy theories.Ironically, many  were  the same crew who have been banging on for  weeks about the need to be kind to those in the public eye.But those rules instituted by the London liberal keyboard warriors only applyyou have the same political views as they do.If you are a Tory or a Brexiteer, or on the right or work for a popular newspaper, you are such an abhorrent human being in the eyes of the likes of Alastair Campbell and Jameela Jamil that you can be torn to shreds without a hint of irony from the perpetrators who are no better than abusive trolls.THE idea that over-weight people need reminding that they’re the  F-wordis nonsensical.If you have been obese and still battle the bulge every day, you’ll know that being the F-word is inside your head every minute.That’s why I embrace the idea put forward in the Pledge To Eradicate Weight Stigma, by Professor Francesco Rubino, from King’s College London, that describing people as fat, overweight and obese is just as debilitating as a racial slur in .Skinny folk convincing themselves that overweight people are McDonald’s-obsessed lazy slobs is offensive and wrong.And that type of outdated approach will do nothing to solve our obesity epidemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister has urged Brits to avoid stockpiling essentials after images emerged of empty shelves in major food outlets, but has reassured he will keep the country fed. High Streets and shopping centres, meanwhile, were largely deserted on Thursday as people stayed at home - in part due to fears of contracting the virus which has already killed more than , worldwide since December. Mr Monteyne, now of investment firm Alliance Bernstein, said the deadly flu-like strain, which likely originated in Wuhan fish markets, could lead to drivers having to self-isolate meaning stores would struggle to re-stock. With warehouses tending to holding up to a fortnight of stock - and even less for perishable goods as well as bulky items like toilet roll, panic buying would quickly see stocks decimated. Crisis mode would then have to be implemented, with supermarkets joining forces to ensure people donapost go hungry, while the Army would be called in to guard stores, ex-retail boss said in a report. Only essential items would be stocked at this point, with depots, trucks and stores all heavily guarded by armed personnel to ensure an even distribution across the country. Yes, it will be chaotic , wrote Mr Monteyne, but the industry will reduce complexity to keep the country fed.  He went on to say the UKaposs biggest grocer, Tesco, is thoroughly prepared for protocol during pandemics, and assured the industry on a whole is well-prepared.  Yesterday the amount of virus cases had doubled in two days in Britain to  while pictures show supermarkets looking more and more depleted. As a result, shoppers have been warned by the likes of retail analyst Patrick OaposBrien not make unnecessary panic buys to avoid putting strain on the supplies available. Mr OaposBrien, of Global Data PLC, said people need to be thinking of the greater good with panic buying only encouraging others to jump on board. He added: We are seeing that online order slots at grocers are filling up are getting booked up for a couple of days ahead, which is highly unusual. Kerry Owens, marketing director at Karium which manufactures Cuticura hand gel, meanwhile, said immediate action had been taken to increase production on the product to meet demand get them on the shelves.  With the number of UK coronavirus cases having jumped up to , Mr Johnson said he would guarantee Britons were getting enough food. Speaking on ITVaposs This Morning, the PM said banning big social gatherings and urging people to stay indoors wouldnapost work to stop the spread.

Sarah Grogan, , and her husband James, , put their son Frankie, three, to bed as usual on May  last year at their home in Timperley, Cheshire, but were horried to find him blue and unresponsive the next morning. Teacher Sarah carried out CPR until the paramedics arrived and Frankie was rushed to Wythenshawe hospital where doctors broke the tragic news that the tot had passed away in his sleep due to Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood Syndrome.  The heartbroken couple, who donapost have any other children, have raised £, to date to fund research into the syndrome, which has no known cause. Sarah said: “Frankie was a healthy and happy boy. I put him to bed as usual and he seemed fine. He woke up at around four in the morning asking for water, which is the norm. James was supposed to be running the Manchester K the next day so I told him we needed to go back to bed because daddy was running and we were all excited. “I stayed with him until he fell asleep and the next morning when we got up, he wasn’t awake before us which is unusual so we went in to check on him and he wasn’t breathing. “That day at the hospital was a horric day. It was just unbelievable, it was surreal. At first, we went into automatic mode, but then we were just in complete shock.” A postmortem revealed Frankie had died of Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood Syndrome, which can occur between the ages of one and .  The cause remains unexplained but often, a seemingly healthy child goes to sleep and never wakes up. More than  children in England and Wales die every year without reason due to the syndrome. Sarah said: “Something had maled in Frankieaposs brain which caused his death, but we don’t understand. “He was perfect, he met all his milestones like walking and talking and he was so smiley. If you ask anyone about him, they’ll say how smiley he was.  “He was up for anything and loved having fun. He was really excited because he’d just started nursery and had loads of friends, who he loved.  Five months after Frankie passed away, Sarah and cargo agent James set up aposFriends of Frankieapos to raise funds for Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood UK, a charity which conducts research into the syndrome. The couple have so far raised a whopping £, with raffles, a ball and auctions and aim to raise a further £k running this yearaposs Manchester k race together in May.  Sarah said raising money for the charity had helped the coupleaposs grieving process. She added: “It’s a bold statement but I want Frankie’s legacy to save other children’s lives - I want it to be positive. I don’t want him to be remembered as that day in the hospital or the immediate aftermath. “I really want people to carry on talking about Frankie, even though he isn’t here anymore.

I saw something wrapped in a towel, lying by the bottom of a tree and I thought somebody had dumped a dead cat or a dead dog and then I saw a little arm or something sticking out.

There was only a small bit of his face exposed, I donapost know how long he had been there but it canapost have been longer than a few hours.

Our priority right now is to ensure she receives the care and assistance she requires. I want to make a direct appeal to her. You may be very frightened right now and it is vitally important that you make contact with us or someone . You may not want to contact the police and I understand that.

It is not the le this bright -year-old envisaged, or chose, for herself. Bodhi wasn’t planned and, although Hannah is still in a relationship with his father she does not live with him and he can only offer piecemeal financial support as he volunteers at a not-for-profit art gallery and does not claim benefits. Hannah, who lives in Middlesbrough, used to work full-time at a bank but says because of childcare costs she cannotto work until Bodhi is three, and eligible for a free nursery place. Hannah’s benefits do not cover her outgoings and she only scrapes by thanks to family and friends. Hannah spoke to the Mirror as we launch our Give Me Five campaign . We are calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty. Are you a parent struggling with poverty  Email webnews@mirror Figures from the End Child Poverty coalition show around % of children are growing up poor in the North East. In Middlesbrough alone there are an estimated ,. We spent Tuesday, March , with Hannah and Bodhi... .am Cuddled up to his mummy, Bodhi’s sleep-encrusted eyes flicker open to the familiar sight of a bare bedroom wall speckled with a grey shadow of mould. The wall is bare because Hannah fears drilling into the damp plaster to hang cheerful pictures or put up shelves. Bodhi’s streaming nose is cold. Outside, it is around C and in here little more. He has woken early because he is poorly with a cold which has lingered for two weeks. The waiting list for social housing is so long, Hannah rents her home from a private landlord, the cost covered partly by housing benefit. The property is not in good repair. Plastic bags are stuffed in holes for “insulation”, the radiator in the bedroom only heats halfway, a saucepan sits on the landing to catch drips from the attic. Setting her heating to come on before she and Bodhi wake up is unthinkable. Read more about our Give Me Five campaign  Hannah says: “People even set the thermostat to come on during the night. Can you imagine ” Her solution is to bring Bodhi into bed with her. She can, at least, provide body heat for her little boy. Today, there is another problem. They must try to do without heating because Hannah has just p in her account and her gas meter, which is perched on the top of her fridge, reads just £.. That will only buy a couple of hours at most and in this drafty Victorian semi it takes at least an hour for the heating to be felt. To sign our petition calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit click here Her weekly child tax credits of £ will not land until half-past midnight, so she must save her precious gas until the evening, when the darkness makes the house even colder. Hannah tries to keep Bodhi snuggling beneath the covers but he is restless, so she wraps him in a fluffy dressing gown with a bear face on the hood and braves downstairs. Sadly, her own dressing gown is stained and can’t be washed because her machine has packed up. am  Bodhi clambers on a cushion that reads Dream Big Little One. He has had a sweet waffle for breakfast – Hannah can buy a five-pack for just p so they have become a staple. Hannah hasn’t eaten. “I’m used to not eating during the day,” she says. She has even gone two days without. It helps the food stretch. Bodhi gurgles happily, making joyful sounds, but he doesn’t talk. Hannah blames herself. “I haven’t been able to socialise him enough.” She can’t afford playgroups very often and says: “The cheapest group is £ but some days that’s the dference between a loaf of bread or not.” There’s another reason she finds herself avoiding them, too. Embarrassment. She can’t afford a coffee with the other mums, hasn’t bought new clothes since Bodhi was born and only owns one pair of shoes. She admits she has been a week without using deodorant. Now she has started to feel anxiety rise when she’s outside the home. Her faded canvas bag reads Yummy Mummy but she feels far from it. .am Hannah is crying. Her local councillor, who has also become a friend because of the volunteering Hannah does, has called round with an envelope. Inside is £, collected by a group of mums so that Hannah can buy a second-hand washing machine. A wave of relief and gratitude trumps embarrassment. Hannah is hardened to asking for help. Frantic WhatsApp messages to her mum asking for £ top-ups to her account, accepting her sister’s offer to pay for Bodhi’s birthday party. But this time, she didn’t ask. Hannah says: “I only survive because of my friends and my family. Because I have them, I’ll never regard myself as poor.” pm Spring sunshine dapples the lounge’s uneven carpet tiles but Bodhi and Hannah remain inside. Bodhi is mesmerised by cartoons. They spend a lot of time indoors, TV on. There aren’t many free options for going out, especially in winter.  And with no car, and buses costing £., Hannah can’t go far. She says: “Some days he doesn’t go out the front door, I feel sad and guilty.” Today though, there is another reason to stay in. Hannah is waiting for the landlord. She has been asking for repairs since she moved in and is desperate for the bedroom radiator to be fixed, and a radiator to be fitted in the bathroom. She says: “When I bath Bodhi it gets so cold I have to keep the shower running, for steam.” But what she loathes most is the “garden”. A pipe which carries waste water from the toilet and household appliances is leaking in one corner. A film of white scum covers the mud. There is no way Bodhi can play here. The Home Sweet Home sign on the lounge wall rings hollow. .pm Bodhi flashes a cheeky grin as he clambers on top of a gravestone. We are in a nearby cemetery. Hannah comes here most days. This is Bodhi’s garden. Hannah explains that the nearest park,  minutes away, is frequented by drug-users. The cemetery is beautul but there isn’t another child in sight. Bodhi is having a ball but a two-year-old should not have to make a graveyard his playground. .pm Bodhi is having omelette for tea, again. Hannah contemplates spending some of the washing machine money on something dferent but she stops herself. She has a couple of eggs, a tin of tuna, and cheese – “a luxury”.  pm Every corner of the house is icy cold. Hannah stares bleakly at bread, cheese, days-old lettuce and grapes – the only fresh ingredients she has. She snaps. She takes a note from the washing machine fund and pops to the shop to top up her gas by a couple more quid. She finds it “mortying” doing this in person and usually uses a phone app to save face.

The couple put on a confident display as they arrived in pouring rain at the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at London’s Mansion House, smiling broadly as they stepped out of their official car. Amid the cheers there was one loud boo from an onlooker, however it did not spoil the mood, with Meghan telling the audience at the awards that it was aposnice to be backapos. They were there to honour the achievements of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women who have taken part in remarkable sporting and adventure challenges over the last year. But all eyes were on Meghan, , who has not been seen in this country since she and Harry made the dramatic announcement that they were quitting public le in early January, much to the distress of the Queen. She upped the glamour stakes in heavy make up and a form fitting turquoise dress by British designer Victoria Beckham, with blue suede heels and gold earring. Her hair was tied back in a pony tail.Harry, who has been made to give up his official patronages after deciding to move to Canada, is being allowed to retain his private links with organisations such as The Endeavour Fund, of which he is patron.The charity supports service personnel keen to use challenges to help with their physical, psychological and social recovery and rehabilitation. Speaking at the event, Harry said: Some of you tonight have told me you have my back, well Iaposm also here to tell you Iaposve always got yours.  Meghan told the audience: Itaposs very nice to be back. Itaposs the third year Iaposve had the incredible fortune of joining my husband here. Itaposs just the most inspiring space. When we were watching the videosall the way in Canada we had the same moment of aposhow are you going to choose apos  Well, weaposve done our best. She presented the aposcelebrating excellenceapos award to Lee Spencer, a rower who serves with the Royal Marines for  years and lost his leg helping with a traffic accident. The annual awards, now in their fourth year, brings together hundreds of wounded, injured and sick serving personnel and veterans as well as their families, friends and supporters of the military community. At a reception with backers, nominees and their families, Harry and Meghan chatted to Lee Spenceraposs we Claire Spencer. The -year-old complimented Meghan on how amazing she looked given that she had just had a baby.  She said afterward: She said ‘oh yes, well he is ten months now and is into everythingapos. Asked what she thought of Harry’s decision to step back as a working royal, she said: I think he does an amazing job, as does she, and we should just let them live the le they want to live. I know what a dference Endeavour has made to my husband’s le since he lost a leg and I hold Harry personally responsible for that. Le is too short. The awards ceremony was hosted by former Invictus Games medallist JJ Chalmers and will see four prizes awarded on the night: Recognising Achievement Award, Celebrating Excellence Award, Henry Worsley Award and The Community Impact Award, a new award for this year. Meghan presented the Celebrating Excellence Award and Harry the Henry Worsley Award, to the inidual who has best inspired others through the demonstration of determination in the face of adversity. It is named in honour of career soldier and adventurer Henry Worsley, who tragically lost his le in January  whilst attempting to cross the Antarctic landmass, solo and unsupported, in order to raise money for the Endeavour Fund. Before the ceremony the couple attended a reception where they met the inspiring nominees, as well as endeavour participants and key supporters of the Endeavour Fund.

The man who owned the shop and was the tenants’ landlord, was found guilty of renting out accommodation that was of such poor quality it ‘posed a serious risk to le’. Deepak Singh Sachdeva who owned the Premier store in Avonmouth Road, Avonmouth, did not turn up to court and was found guilty of a host of offences under both the Housing Act  and the  Houses in Multiple Occupation Act. The living accommodation was above the shop’s rear storage area, and the court heard it was found to be ‘of poor structural condition and design, posing serious risk to le due to inadequate fire separation and precautions’. “There was very poor fire resistant separation between the shop store and the flat above, with the floorboards of the living accommodation clearly visible from the storage area immediately below,” a council spokesperson said. “Other property defects included large gaps around fire doors, offering no protection from potential fire or smoke hazards. There was no working fire detection in place prior to emergency smoke detectors being fitted by the council. “One of the studio flats also lacked basic ventilation, with no external windows and limited access via a poorly maintained staircase,” he added. Singh Sashdeva, who lives in Surbiton in Surrey, was ordered to pay £, in fines, and with costs and a victim fund surcharge, he will have to pay £,.  “The magistrates felt that the high penalty reflected the money made from the tenants, given the severity of complete disregard for the safety of tenants, particularly children and the serious risk to le the property posed,” the council spokesperson added. The city council has beefed up its action on tackling slum landlords, and has brought in tougher licensing rules for HMOs across Bristol, and landlord licensing more generally in many parts of Bristol. “These were some of the worst conditions environmental health officers working in this field have seen,” said the council’s cabinet member for housing, Cllr Paul Smith.

There was some hope death row inmate Nathaniel Woodsapos execution may have been called off after the US Supreme Court granted a last minute stay, but this was lted hours later.The -year-old dad had requested sweet potatoes, spinach, chicken patty and leg quarter, cooked apples, fries, two oranges and an orange-flavoured drink, reports ABC News .However, he only had a bite of the chicken before leaving the rest of the meal untouched, according to a statement from Alabama Department of Corrections. Woods had made calls to his father, sister, daughter and mother, as well as friends, in the hours before his execution on Thursday evening at William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore. As of yesterday afternoon, more than , people had signed a petition on Change.org to keep the inmate alive with Supreme Court Judge Clarence Thomas issuing a temporary stay  minutes before the scheduled execution at pm. However, this was lted and Woods was announced dead at .pm.  The inmate was convicted for his part in what became known as the aposdeadliest dayapos in the history of Alabamaaposs Birmingham Police Department in . Officers Carlos Owen, Harley A. Chisholm III and Charles R Bennett were shot dead by Kerry Spencer at an apartment in Birmingham where Woods was also present but didnapost pull the trigger. Prosecutors, however, said Woods had lured the three law enforcers into the home where they were killed - but supporters claim the evidence against him doesnapost stack up. During his trial - in a practice abandoned by every other US state except Alabama - the jury could not even come to a unanimous decision on his sentencing, with two opposed to the death penalty.  The decision to press on with the execution came after Alabama Governor Kay Ivey reviewed a letter from Woodsapos legal team requesting a reprieve from the death sentence, but said she would allow the execution to proceed. In a y statement, the governor said: There is no evidence, and no argument has been made, that Nathaniel Woods tried to stop the gunman from committing these heinous crimes. In fact, he later bragged about his participation in these horric murders. She referred to the testimony of  witnesses at Woodsapos trial, including law enforcement officers and forensics experts, adding the jury did not view Woodsapos acts as those of an innocent bystander, they believed that he was a fully engaged participant.  Alabama State Attorney General Steve Marshall agreed in a statement on Wednesday that Woods was correctly found guilty and sentenced to death by a jury of his peers. Woods became the first person executed in Alabama in  and the th since the state reinstated the death penalty in . Gov Ivey noted two Alabama citizens had also been executed since  as being accomplices to capital murder. The murders took place on June , , at an apartment in Ensley, Birmingham, with the three officers attempting to serve a warrant for Woodsapos arrest on suspicion of a misdemeanor assault.  Spencer confessed to being the lone shooter but Woods, who was also in the property at the time, was charged as an accomplice with prosecutors claiming they both lured the men to their deaths. A jury convicted Woods in December  but there was a - split on whether he should be executed.  Kim Kardashian West was one celebrity who campaigned for Woods to be granted a stay of execution in a tweet last night in which the socialite and influencer said he would otherwise be executed for a crime he did not commit. She later said: Nate will die for a crime another man confessed to and says Nate had nothing to do with. My heart and prayers are with Nate and his family and all the advocates who worked tirelessly to save his le. Martin Luther King Jraposs son Martin III wrote a letter to the courts claiming that the execution was an injustice.Killing this African American man, whose case appears to have been strongly mishandled by the courts, could produce an irreversible injustice, he wrote in the letter, posted to Twitter on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"dog owner discovers pup most","story":"NewsDog owner discovers pup has the most adorable smile after taking her to groomerDucky the dog has gone viral on social media after her owner shared adorable photos of her smile which became fully visible following a trip to the groomersShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsLook at that cheeky grin! \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e5f7607109c29.60228049-scaled.jpg ","title":"hemmings set to return says boss","story":"James McPake expects Kane Hemmings tofor Dundee against Ayr United this weekend.The Dark Blues’ top scorer missed last night’s frustrating draw with Alloa after failing to shake off a persistent illness.Despite creating multiple chances, the Dee drew a blank in his absence.But their manager expects to have him back in time to face the Honest Men.“Kano will come back for Saturday,” said McPake.“Kano was ill last night.

We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night. We just need to put those away going forward.“Alloa was a crazy game. When you look back at how many chances we created – good chances too. In a normal game they go in and it’s -.“It’s one of those things. We’ve taken a lot of positives from it and we’ll take them into the Ayr game.“I’m surprised, from the way I’ve seen us play, that we’re not further up the league.“The squad is a really good one. I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here. Everyone in and around the club is great and I would love to stay herethe club want me.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee finding form as united stutter on title march","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, Sean Hamilton and Graeme Finnan dissect Dundee’s recent upturn in fortunes, discuss what United need to do to get their title march back on course and Billy Gilmour – is he good enough to be capped Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e621255e805a3.39290847-scaled.jpg ","title":"reynolds fresh united need not worry about ict in title approach","story":"Captain Mark Reynolds believes a re-invigorated Dundee United side should have no concerns about Inverness as they aim to sew up the Championship title.Reynolds insists United are not worrying about an ICT side who have closed the gap at the top to  points and have two games in hand as they enter the final round of fixtures against Partick Thistle at Tannadice tomorrow.What was otherwise a good point as the Terrors played out a goalless draw at Ayr United on Tuesday night was soured slightly by the Caley Jags’ late - win over Morton.However, defender Reynolds feels, with no more midweek games between now and the end of the season, the Tangerines have an advantage over their opponents with more hectic schedules.Askedhe was disappointed to discover Inverness had won, the -year-old said: “Not really. It is what it is with them, they’re going to pick up results.“We’re not at the stage where we’re worrying about Inverness yet. We just need to focus on our own business.“We need to find those performances and results again.“Every game is going to be tough and Inverness are going to push it all the way.“They need to keep winning and hope we keep slipping up, but there’s nine games to go and we just need to look after our own business.“We’re still only a few wins away from it so we just keep taking it one game at a time as our focus turns to Partick tomorrow.“This league is tough. It’s dficult just now but the run we were on was unbelievable.“To go those  games unbeaten was incredible and that’s what got us that cushion.“Everybody is capable of beating each other and it’s never an easy night.“We went down to Ayr and they’re a good side, pushing for second place.

It’s a cup final when teams play us. Inverness felt that when they played us the other week and it was the same for Ayr.“It’ll be a tough run-in with people taking points off each other but we just need to keep plugging away and re-focus.“Luckily, our schedule goes from weekend to weekend from now on so we can hit every game fresh, with teams coming in with strained squads playing Saturday-Tuesday.”Reynolds admits United are eager to get back on home soil after some tough games on the road.“Tannadice has been a good place for us and we’re looking forward to getting back on a nice pitch.“The pitch down at Ayr held up well considering the amount of rain we’ve had but it’s nice to get back home.“We need to keep going and pushing to make sure we get three points. I think there’s pressure on every game, home and away, when you play for Dundee United.“We’re coming into every game as the league leaders and it’s been like that all season, but we’ve managed to handle it so far.“We go into every game confident we can win but we know that’s not going to happen.

The previous season Main had run riot in scoring twice for Well to beat Aberdeen - in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden in April .Main suffered a frustrating start to his Pittodrie career, due partly to the form of -goal striker Cosgrove.Now Lewis reckons he has rediscovered the form that terrorised the Dons at the national stadium.The keeper said: “We have a bit more to our attacking game at the moment.“It’s the player I remember playing against us when he was at Motherwell.“I didn’t look forward to facing him then and I know the centre-halves didn’t either.“He really does give the opposition a real handful.”January signing Matty Kennedy, secured for £, from St Johnstone until summer , will also be pivotal tomorrow.Kennedy supplied the cross that led to Connor McLennan’s equaliser against Kilmarnock on Wednesday.Lewis said: “Matty has been dferent class since he’s come into the club.“His attitude off the pitch is the same as it is on the pitch. It’s positive.“He’s a likeable lad and has been really good for us.”For the second time in less than a month Aberdeen fought back from behind at Rugby Park to salvage a result. Last month they hit two late goals in the final minute of extra-time to defeat Kilmarnock - in the Scottish Cup fth-round replay.Lewis said: “We were disappointed with the goals we lost, but again we showed character to come back from it.“We saw it before at Rugby Park and I thought we’d kick on and win the game at -. But both teams had chances.“We couldn’t find that final piece. We went there to win the game, but being two goals down, we cannot be too disappointed.”There was understandable frustration within the Aberdeen camp at the opening goal at Kilmarnock.Referee Alan Newlands awarded a penalty for hand-ball by Ash Taylor.However, the centre-back turned his back to the shot with his arms tight by his body. The ball struck his back.Lewis said: “It was two poor goals lost, although I think Ash had his arms by his side at the penalty.“I watched it again and he’s turned with his arm in. It wasn’t up in the air. It hit his arm, but I don’t know where  he could put it and that was harsh on him.”Although beaten twice at Rugby Park the -year-old keeper made a number of vital saves.He produced a superb one-handed ing stop to tip a Stephen O’Donnell volley over the bar.Lewis said: “I was pleased with the save from Stephen O’Donnell.“I was pleased to make some saves and play a part in winning a point.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

We also take a look at what farming is doing to tackle climate change – the issue of the decade.#We were delighted to work alongside NFUS to produce these episodes of OnFARM. Podcasting is a superb way to get key messages across in a way that is enjoyable to listen to and yet informative at the same time.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"subsidy stays to keep swimming pools afloat","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAmid the swathe of cost-cutting measures agreed by Argyll and Bute Council for  , one part of the policy savings proposals was spared the axe.Among the plans, a subsidy of £, given annually to swimming pools in Mid Argyll and Islay and Jura was to have been cut entirely.This sparked protest and a petition on Islay and Jura in February, as reported in the Advertiser.Councillors, in the end, decided at their budget meeting on February  to retain the subsidy.Kim Ritchie, chair of Mid Argyll Community Enterprises Limited which owns and operates Mid Argyll Community Pool, said: #Everyone at MACPool is delighted that the council has managed to maintain our school swimming subsidy in such a dficult budget.#It means we#ll be able to carry on supporting schools in teaching kids to swim and keeping them safe around water.#"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-girls-film-comes-peebles","story":"IN celebration of International Womenrsquos Day next Sundaythe Eastgate Theatre is screening a remarkable collection of short films that tell the stories of the women of Scotland from the reign of King Edward to the rule of Margaret Thatcher.During the th century, Scotlandrsquos women lived through major social change, challenging their roles in society and fighting for equality: at work and at home, from classroom to croft, and from girlhood to motherhood.Their rich and ied voices are heard in Her Century ndash a timely collection of archive films, curated by the National Library of Scotland Moving Image Archive, that provides a fascinating glimpse into the work, school and home lives of Scottish women.The films are screened together for the first time in a touring programme full of contemporary relevance.

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin.

Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC. Kick-off is pm with Kintyre Park the expected venue.

In The Decameron a group of wealthy, beautul, young nobles lock themselves up in a stately home in northern Italy, and tell stories to one another to pass the time while the plague ravages the countryside outside. Itrsquos like an apocalyptic forerunner of The Canterbury Tales.Not long after the British crew gets to northern Italy to film The Decameron, with the set a real-le stately home, they find they have to lsquoself-isolatersquo as coronavirus is on the warpath beyond the walls. That bizarre little incident was real ndash itrsquos just happened. Rest assured that when the film comes out the behind-the-scenes DVD extras will be quite something. You canrsquot help but think coronavirus is having a laugh at us. Itrsquos chuckling to itself as it points out that le is just as fragile in  as it was in .Of course, the coronavirus isnrsquot Samuel Beckett. The idea that a disease has some bleakly comic point to make is nonsense, but you canrsquot deny that therersquos something neatly perfect about the film crew story ndash even down to the fact that Italy was the epicentre in Europe for the Black Death, and now Italy is the European epicentre for coronavirus hellip or Chinese Cough, as Americarsquos Saturday Night Live crew called it a few days ago.So far coronavirus has made a lot of darkly sophisticated points about modern le. Forgive the terrible pun, butcoronavirus was on social media, its posts would be so clever and zeitgeisty that theyrsquod go viral in minutes.The disease likes sticking its finger in the wounds where humanity is psychologically most tender. Each of us knows in our heart that globalisation is a cursed gt. I can holiday in Bali, but I can also buy cheap clothes made by child slaves. Wersquore all connected, but jobs are going overseas. In a globalised world, only wealth matters. The rich win, the poor lose.Coronavirus is the ultimate manestation of globalisation. Itrsquos taken our cheap travel, and cheap labour, our endless movement of capital and people, and itrsquos ridden them like a championship jockey around the world. Will wealth protect the global elite Coronavirus isnrsquot politically correct either. It could soon start making some otherwise decent people think about immigration in very frightening ways. Racism stands in the wings right now, but it could quickly march on stage. It wonrsquot take much for some among us to start looking for scapegoats.:Coronavirus could restrict movement of people in ScotlandThe disease began in China ndash a totalitarian dictatorship. Then coronavirus hopped on its horse called Globalisation and made its way west.

Edinburgh University, astonishingly, failed to support her.The gay tennis icon Martina Navratilova was expelled from the LGBT group, Athlete Ally, for saying that people with male physiques should not complete in womenrsquos sport.Cultural and health bodies, and even the Scottish Government, were ceasing to use the very word ldquowoman in case it offended male-bodied transwomen. Bizarre substitutes like ldquowomxn, ldquomenstruators and ldquociswomen were being deployed in the cause of inclusivity.Well, times change. This issue is now out in the open. More and more women are speaking out against the undermining of sex-based rights.Even the ultra-wokeis permitting columns from feminists like Suzanne Moore calling for an end to the ldquono ing of gender-critical academics like Professor Selina Todd and Dr Kathleen Stock. They have been labelled as ldquoTerfs by trans zealots.Last week, the UK Government called a halt to self-identication legislation south of the Border. Ministers discovered that children as young as  are being given puberty blockers by gender reassignment clinics. Puberty blockers halt the sexual development of children. They are of the class of drugs once used as chemical castration for sex offenders.Influential figures in the SNP, like the former communications guru, Kevin Pringle, are now urging Nicola Sturgeon to follow the UK Government. But the Scottish Equalities Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, apparently intends to press ahead with legislation to allow self-ID. Mr Pringle is speaking for many in the party who now realise that the growing backlash against Self-ID could threaten the SNPrsquos chances in next yearrsquos Holyrood elections.Yet it seemed glaringly obvious to me two years ago that women would never accept this existential assault on their sexual identity. How could they be expected to accept people with male genitalia and masculine physiques as real women  Why should women be forced to accept male-bodied transwomen in their protected spaces, in changing rooms and toilets Indeed, at first I thought this proposition that transwomen were literally women was just anti-trans scaremongering. Surely activists werenrsquot actually saying that they were biologically female I learned the hard way that this is precisely what they were saying. I was repeatedly accused of hate speech for suggesting that this would mean the removal of human biology from the school curriculum.Political leaders like Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson continue to insist that people with penises can be and are actually female. Labourrsquos Shadow Equalities Secretary, Dawn Butler, said last month that ldquobabies are born without a sex. This is pure flat earthism.Shamefully, leading feminists like Germaine Greer have been ldquocancelled for objecting to extreme transgenderism as misogyny. That it demeans and invalidates women.How could someone with a male body possibly experience social reality in the way real women do  Transwomen do not have uteruses, do not menstruate, do not give birth.Trans advocates reply that, well, some women canrsquot give birth and some women donrsquot menstruate. This is ridiculous and offensive sophistry. Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does. Butso she needs to say it loud and clear before half the voting population ndash women ndash turn against the SNP.Read more: Super Tuesday will showcase Democrats dismal failure to take on Donald Trump"},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  It  39 s time we moved on from obsession with the terrible Tudors","story":"Anne Boleyn did not emerge centre stage like Botticellirsquos Venus, but some believe it was here that Henry VIII first caught sight of her. The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels. The past might well be a foreign country, as L P Hartley wrote, but some areas seem to attract package holiday tours, leaving tumbleweed to roll through the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"high-tech-welcome-iconic-bass-rock-gannets","story":"Some  per centof Europersquos Northern Gannets, with their distinctive yellow heads and sand black wing tips, see Scotland as home.And the Scottish Seabird Centre is welcoming theirthis year with the installation of state-of-the-art live cameras which will help inspire the Sir David Attenboroughs of the future.The worldrsquos biggest gannet colony can be found on Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, with over , birds swarming every inch of the island during the breeding season.They travel south for the winter, many as far as the coast of West Africa.Over a dozen have already made their way to the ft high, steep-sided volcanic rock in North Berwick, marking the start of a mass arrival which is seen as a major event in the breeding season.It is a particularly welcome sight given growing fears over falling seabird populations.In December  a University of Aberdeen study found that marine species are the most at risk due to competition they face from the fishing industry for food.Researchers found there had been a  per cent drop in populations as a result of fishing , pollution and habitat destruction.Other experts fear that one possible cause of the decrease is that waters around the UK have increased in temperature by more than C thanks to global warming.In the wake of this change, seas have also seen a dramatic loss of zooplankton while sand eels ndash a critically important source of food for many birds ndash have disappeared from many parts of the Atlantic.However, the gannet has been increasing in number at roughly two per cent a year since the early s.Some experts believe this trendbucking growth is largely thanks to their extensive feeding range.The birds are known to fly in excess of  miles in search of food.Experts who monitor the colonies also believe the gannetsrsquo resilience is because they are adaptable in what they eat and so rarely encounter food shortages.Maggie Sheddan, Bass Rock guide for the Scottish Seabird Centre, said: ldquoAt this time of year we begin to see the gannets circling Bass Rock in small numbers and waiting for their partners to .ldquoBy the end of the month, weather dependent, we hope to see thousands vying for nesting sites on the island.ldquoThis sighting is a signicant milestone in the start of the breeding season on the Firth of Forth islands.The Scottish Seabird Centrersquos interactive live cameras are located on the Firth of Forth islands, including the Bass Rock.

As Britainrsquos largest seabird, they have a wing span of over ft, e at speeds of up to mph and can live for over  years.Researchers at the University of Glasgow discovered that travelling as part of a flock appeared to be about more than just gaining aerodynamic benefits.The more experienced adult birds were often found at the front of commuting flocks, the younger birds following behind.The results add weight to the theory that young gannets learn to hunt by following their elders, with knowledge of the best feeding grounds passed down from generation to generation.Bass Rock, formed  million years ago from an old volcano, has been owned by the Hamilton-Dalrymple family for the last  years. It has famously been described by Sir David Attenborough as ldquoone of the  wildle wonders of the world."},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs-happened-nicola-sturgeon-quizzed-coronavirus-response","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has faced questions over the Scottish Governments response to coronavirus and also the collapse of Flybe.The First Minister warns that \"we may not be able to contain this virus indefinitely\" and could have to move to the delay phase where more extreme measures could be considered."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-third-native-woodland-thought","story":"The study into Woodland Ecological Condition is the largest and most in-depth assessment of the ecological condition of any habitat in Great Britain.Published as official statistics by the National Forest Inventory , it reveals that in Scotland , hectares are now classied as native woodland.The figure is up , hectares on the previous estimate reported in the  Native Woodland Survey of Scotland assessment.The majority of this is in the North East and West of Scotland.Scotlandrsquos native woodland coverage is also set to increase as the nation continues to meet its target for native woodland planting set out in the Bioersity Route Map to  and Scotlandrsquos Bonn Challenge commitment.In  Scotland planted  hectares of native woodland.The statistics reveal that over , hectares of these native woodlands are in overall ldquofavourable or ldquointermediate condition.They also show that Scotlandrsquos non-native woodlands make an ecological contribution, with less than % in ldquounfavourable ecological condition.Rural Economy and Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing, welcomed the new report.He said: ldquoThis is the first report of its kind and we welcome it as a positive step forward in woodland management.ldquoThese statistics provide a reliable indication of woodland ecological condition across all woodland types in Scotland.ldquoThey show that Scotland has even more native woodland than previously thought, and that almost all of our forests are making a real contribution in terms of environmental benefits.ldquoImportantly, they provide us with a measure of how our forests and woodlands are becoming more resilient to future climate challenges -- by developing those ecological conditions and processes found naturally in native woodlands.ldquoWhen compared to the challenging benchmark of ancient semi-natural woodland, this shows which of the native woodland benefits modern forestry possess.ldquoThis is valuable information that will help to shape and deliver more strategic, cost-effective policies and management interventions that will help Scotland to improve the quality of its woodlands for bioersity, for visitors, and all those who benefit from Scotlandrsquos forests, while still delivering timber for our expanding construction industry.Stuart Goodall, Chief Executive of Confor -- the membership organisationfor sustainable forestry and wood-using businesses --said: ldquoThis is an important piece of work which provides vital baseline data to inform the success of woodland policies and incentives in delivering for bioersity in the future.ldquoIt shows that all kinds of woodland can deliver for bioersity -- including productive forests.

They need to speak English and have a job offer at an ldquoappropriate skill level, with points also awardedthey earn more than pound,.Mr Jack said the points-based system ldquowill ensure that the Scottish economy continues to gain access to the labour it requires, and we will treat everybody based on their skills and contribution, not on where they came from.He said: ldquoThis will mean it will get a lot easier for Scottish companies to recruit the labour they need from outside the EU, EEA countries, but it will be harder to recruit from within the EU, EEA countries.ldquoThe under-secretary of state [Douglas Ross] and I have been very keen to meet with Scottish stakeholders over the last week, and wersquove done so to discuss the genuine dficulties that we acknowledge arise from some of the points-based system.He insisted the proposed salary threshold is ldquoreasonable.He made the comments while giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee.The First Minister previously outlined plans for a ldquoScottish visa, but Mr Jack stressed immigration will not be devolved and a ldquoUK-wide solution is needed to address any problems.He and Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw met with Boris Johnson on Wednesday.

However, the issue that really concerned them was the tax burden and the fact that it seems to be getting worse.Take this weekrsquos news for example. According to the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget watchdog the Scottish Fiscal Commission, the business rates burden is likely to rise by % in the next three years, from pound.bn this year to pound.bn in  . The Government says part of the reason is that appeals made after the  re-evaluations are finally being settled it also wheeled out that old familiar excuse: ldquothings are worse in England. But the result is the same: businesses are going to have to pay a lot more tax.The  Barclay review into business rates, which was implemented by Holyrood on Thursday, was supposed to make things better and to some extent it will ndash reviewing the rates every three years instead of five for instance. But the opportunity for profound and radical reform has been missed. There will be no revolution or reinvention of the business rates system, only repair and patch-up.But even the patch-ups have not fixed many of the systemic problems. The assessment system, for example, still throws up gross disparities between dferent types of businesses. And even at three years, rates are not reviewed often enough which means a business can be paying tax based on an old model . City centre rates are also still way too high compared to the rates for out-of-town shopping malls, creating a disincentive to move into the centre of towns and cities where theyrsquore needed.And underlying it all is the problem that has yet to be tackled, which is that business rates are based on the old idea that most of us shop on the high street, which, as we know, is increasingly not the case. Indeed, at precisely the same time as British people have adopted the habit of moaning about the state of the high street, they have also adopted online shopping with greater alacrity than other European countries. In other words, British shoppers are decrying a situation which they helped to create and the tax system needs to reflect that.What this means in practice is reducing the tax burden on businesses on the high street and raising the money from where. In a world in which a chain as mighty as John Lewis is struggling , it cannot be right that firms that provide investment and employment are so heavily taxed. At the very least, the tax should be flexible so it can be zero-rated in areas that need new shops or when profits are falling or low. Indeed, why canrsquot we move towards abolishing business rates altogether To make up the shortfall, the system would obviously need to be reformed to raise taxes instead from those who can most afford it. In the business world, that would mean a large digital services charge on companies like Google and Amazon that are still paying grossly low levels of tax. It would also helpthe Scottish Government did what it once said it would and reformed council tax so itrsquos fairer and raises more money from the better-off.Moving towards such a system would involve an increased cost for ordinary taxpayers because digital companies would inevitably pass the cost on to their customers, and some people would have to pay more council tax. But we cannot go on as we are. The competition between the high street and online, between bricks-and-mortar and keyboard, needs to be fairer. And the system needs to be re-calibrated so that tax is never so high that it damages business.Most importantly, however, the Scottish Government, and Scotlandrsquos councils, need to change their attitude to the high street and stop squeezing the goose for more eggs. The goose, Irsquom afraid to say, is ailing. The goose might die. We need to stop acting like itrsquos still big and fat and juicy."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-ask-serious-questions-benefits-scottish-parliament-brings-scots","story":"Is it time to have a forensic look at what benefit,any, the Scottish Parliament brings to Scots Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.TRULY, therersquos none so blind as those who wonrsquot see.

Amongst his many wilful misinterpretations, his reference to ldquohellipattempts to break up Canadarsquos -year-old unionhellip is particularly revealing. The UK is a union Canada is a Confederation.

And even that may not be enough to save the confederation, whose fate still hangs in the balance. By contrast, there is not, and never has been, anything remotely federal about UK governance. The UK is the most centralised of all the democracies. It is as far from any kind of Canadian federalism as is possible. The idea that it would ever embrace such federalism is disingenuous nonsense.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 27 ","story":"With the Six Nations Rugby Championship now three-fths of the way through, only France remain unbeaten.Scotland’s victory over Italy in Rome on Saturday was deserved, and enough to avoid the ignominy of the wooden spoon.As a spectacle the match will not live long in the memory, save for captain Stuart Hogg scoring the kind of try that only a few in the world can produce.Hogg’s display overall was very good, both defensively and from an attacking point of view. From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury.

He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door.

There is no ceiling on my ambition for Alliance.I would love us to become the largest party in Northern Ireland. I don#t know that it will happen on my watch but I want to build the foundations. Mrs Long said her party#s membership had doubled in two years. She believed it could now win Assembly seats in West Tyrone, Upper Bann, East Londonderry and North Antrim next time and take two in some other constituencies so it would be challenging for between  and  seats and added that she had no regrets about entering the Executive rather than going into opposition. You can#t ask people to make compromises when you#re not willing to do so yourself, she said. I don#t want to be outside the room criticising what#s going on, I want to be inside trying to shape it. The biggest challenge is to avoid thisbecoming highly personalised and about iniduals. It#s about addressing the systemic failures and ensuring that those things done wrong in the past won#t happen againShe said it wasn#t an easy executive, it#s dficult. The parties would cross swords at times but there had been no fireworks. There was an open, healthy debate at the table.There are some bumps in the road ahead, she said. The budget will be dficult, the RHI report won#t be easy. But it should not be used as an opportunity to tear strips off each other and make things more dficult. The biggest challenge is to avoid thisbecoming highly personalised and about iniduals. It#s about addressing the systemic failures and ensuring that those things done wrong in the past won#t happen again.She said she didn#t knowthe report would recommend police investigations, potential prosecutions for illegality or whether the conclusion would be that the RHI scheme was just badly managed.She said progress had already been made on addressing some of the issues raised at the cash-for-ash inquiry - codes of practice and pay for special advisers, ministerial accountability, transparency and record keeping.On the murder of Paul Quinn, Mrs Long called on Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy to specically and unambiguously state that the -year-old Cullyhanna man wasn#t a criminal. I wouldn#t be as presumptuous as some to say a border poll is inevitable in five or  years, but I do think it is more likely than it was previouslyWhen you#re a politician, you have a lot of influence. What you say carries weight in the community. You#re an opinion-former. So when you say somebody#s a criminal, that has implications for whether people are willing to come forward with information to the police, she said.It is important that Conor does say that Paul Quinn wasn#t a criminal. The pain that Breege and Stephen have been through is horrendous. Their son#s awful death was added to by the fact that he was smeared publicly.They live this nightmare every day. I would hope that Conor would find it within himself to bring a measure of peace to this family.Asked about the possibility of a border poll in her letime, Mrs Long said the chances had increased due to Brexit.I wouldn#t be as presumptuous as some to say a border poll is inevitable in five or  years, but I do think it is more likely than it was previously, she said.The theme of Alliance#s conference is # Vision# and the party will be celebrating its th anniversary. Mrs Long said she wished to pay tribute to those who came up with the idea of a cross-community party in , the grimmest of times.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related ContentPoliticsNaomi Long: #I don#t fully understand why MLA Trevor Lunn left#Naomi Long has said sheremains unclear as to why Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunnquit the Alliance Party butdismissed speculation that he felt he was being pushed aside in favour of Sorcha Eastwood.PoliticsAlliance Party rake in most donations with £kThe Alliance Party topped the list of donations received by Northern Ireland#s political parties in the last quarter of .

A spokesperson for JPM Contracts said they were honoured to be part of the team which has restored the castle to its former glory.“It is not every day you get to be involved working in a medieval castle, especially of such high signicance,” the spokesperson said.“The work started in March  to replace the existing flat roof which has been in place for the past  years. The new roof is keeping with the late-medieval architecture of the Castle.“It has made from Irish Oak used ‘green’ and oak-pegged without the use of nails or metal fixings.Storm Ophelia“The Irish Oak was sourced from oak trees which came down in Wicklow during Storm Ophelia in October .“The new roof is a series of open trusses and rafters carrying oak boards.“Externally the roof is finished in Cumbrian stone slates and lead.“The external appearance of the Castle does not look signicantly dferent from ground level as the roof is behind the battlements.“However, internally, the Great Hall at the top of the Tower has been transformed into a higher, brighter and more historically resonant space.”Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey said: “This investment has secured the future of this important monument and prevented irreparable damage to the structure.“Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof,” said the Minister.“What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoe Clarke, from Ballykelly, is an Engagement Ambassador for VOYPIC and told the County Derry Post that the evening was a great success.She said: “We had a few children singing the Bare Necessities and they had the whole crowd going.“It’s a  to highlight and show appreciation for the talents of these young people that might get bypassed in other areas.“It gives them a chance to stand on that stage and show who they are. One young boy performed his own rap at the event.“It was about being in care, his le at home and his feelings and emotions towards his social workers. Everyone in the room could relate to it.”The -year-old credits the organisation with a great deal of her own success.She said: “I became known to the organisation when I was about   and without them, I don’t think I would be where I am today.“I grew up care experienced and lived on the edge of care my whole le but at , I was made homeless. I lived in Jefferson’s Court on Shipquay Street.“That’s when I became known to VOYPIC, because I wasn’t getting what I was actually entitled to. If you are classied as a LAC, you are provided accommodation by social services.“I wasn’t. I was completely overlooked.”VOYPIC plays a crucial role in making sure that young people in care have access to the support and information they need to make informed decisions about their lives.With offices in Derry, Belfast, Ballymena and Lurgan, another aspect of the charity’s work is filling gaps in the information available to young people in and on the edge of care.Aoe says it is easy for some young people to slip through the cracks.“A lot of young people living on the edge of care can easily fly under the radar and I don’t think information is publicised enough for them to know what they’re entitled to.“I had a really bad experience with the teachers in secondary school because they just didn’t get it at all. It’s hard to expect people to get itthey’ve never received any training.”Aoe is currently in her final year of a psychology degree at Ulster University in Coleraine and, in her role with VOYPIC, is determined to make a dference to those currently re-living her experience.“I’m doing my dissertation on educational pathways to rd level education, specically for care leavers.“A lot of the students I’ve interviewed indicated they weren’t aware of the support available to them – we want to change that.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

All Flybe flights, and those operated by Stobart Air, have been cancelled. Therefore, anyone who has booked with Flybe from Belfast City Airport is advised not to go to the airport as your flight will not be operating. Flybe customers are therefore urged to make their own alternative travel arrangements via other airlines, rail or coach operators. For flights operated by Flybe franchise partnerspassengers should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements. googletag.cmd.push The UK Civil Aviation Authority will provide advice and information to consumers, so check their website and Twitter feed @UK_CAA for more information. Commenting, Richard Moriarty Chief Executive at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: “This is a sad day for UK aviation and we know that Flybes decision to stop trading will be very distressing for all of its employees and customers. “We urge passengers planning to fly with this airline not to go to the airport as all Flybe flights are cancelled. For the latest advice, Flybe customers should visit the CAA website or the CAAs Twitter feed for more information. googletag.cmd.push “Flybe also operated a number of codeshare partnerships with international airlines. If you have an international ticket you should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements.” Reacting to the Flybe news, Jenner McKeever, Director of Airporter in Derry, said:“The news that Flybe has gone into administration is dreadful news. “Flybe has provided a vital service for thousands of commuters who use the airline on a regular basis to travel from Northern Ireland to work in Britain or further afield. “As a peripheral region, connectivity for NI is absolutely crucial, whether it’s to encourage inward investment, to encourage indigenous business to expand and sell to other markets, or to encourage more visitors to the region, flights into and out of Northern Ireland are key to investment, business growth and tourism. “The loss of this service will be hugely damaging to our economy because it breaks that connectivity from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Not only does it make le harder for many businesses who rely on these regional routes, but it also will have an impact on our tourism industry at a time when we are trying to attract more visitors to our shores.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

Each visit brings a new opportunity and on what will be the first Derry game played on grass this season, Devine is hoping for a change in fortune at Waterford.“Theres a lot of excitement but we have got to make sure that the excitement that we are generating is also fulfilled with hard work and the ability to grind out results and that is key at this stage of the season,” he said. “Its not about the beautul game to be honest. Id rather go to Waterford which is a dficult venue and be able to dig out a brilliant win than be very expansive and pretty and lovely on the ball and come away with a - defeat.”Waterford are hoping to avoid a third successive home defeat as well as score their first home goal of the season, but Devine is just focusing on his team.“Its key for me that they continue to trust each other and continue to know each others strengths and weaknesses and to understand what way we want to evolve as a team. “Its very much a work in progress,” he explained.“It was fantastic that we got three points last week but the key now is going to get another three points. Its very dficult, we didnt win there last year, we threw away a - lead with  seconds in the game and we took the lead down there the last time and conceded a poor goal from a corner. “We didnt win in the RSC last year and we know its going to be extremely dficult down there this year because they are spitting a bit of fire as well. “They will be disappointed to have lost their last two, but they also showed a lot of quality when they went to St. Pats and won -.” googletag.cmd.push PotentialDevine is excited at the potential in his squad this season and he is expecting big things from the young players going forward.“Its a very young side – there were five players under  who finished the game,” he added. “A lot of them are playing in this league for then first time. The omens are good. I back these players and I back the players with a lot of experience to help these players. We had a great week last week but we now have to try and have another memorable night in the RSC.“You could go through the Waterford team and theres a lot of talent in there and a lot of experience, but theres also a lot of players who can hurt youyoure not right so were under no illusions. “Its going to be a big battle down here. Its our first game on grass so it has the makings of a fantastic game. I know Alan Reynolds very well and he will very determined that they dont lose three home games in a row.” Ciaran Collwill have a late fitness test ahead of tomorrows game, while Ally Gilchrist remains a doubt after suffering concussion against Bohemians. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music.

Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them.

The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch.

A best kept garden competition is another idea.The town committee hopes to tie all the events into Down Councilrsquos anti-litter campaign later this year when a prize of pound will be awarded to the best kept town or village in the council area.Some members of the town committee, however, fear Killyleagh could get off to a bad start in the competition because of the major housing redevelopment schemes at Shore Street and Irish Street, and the overall shabby appearance of roads and footpaths in the area.DUNDRUM mdash Ambitious plans to make Dundrum Regatta and Sports bigger and better were drawn at the Regatta Committeersquos annual meeting in the Bay Inn on Monday night.Ideas to cater for teenagers, introduce a more ied programme and revert to a date in mid July were considered at the well attended meeting.Before the election of officers, which saw Mr Hugh Graham re-elected as chairman and Mr Pierce Rice appointed secretary, the committee congratulated Mr Dan McNeill for his -year association with the committee,  of which were spent as chairman.One of the more pleasing aspects to come out of the meeting was the formation of a group, to be known as the teenage committee, which will should out what teenagers want to see in the programme of events, this ensuring young, middle-aged and elderly will be catered for.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
