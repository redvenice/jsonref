Germany put up a great fight but in the end England managed to claim the win, albeit with Bright’s goal being offside. If you want to recap all the action from the match, read Suzy Wrack’s report here.Ian Wright has made a good point as the assistant referee was perfectly line up and should have spotted the error. “Today we weren’t tight enough but then you have to be compact as a team. “When I came in this team had a lot of experience. The eagerness to commitment and wanting to learn is immense. It has been a pleasure so far. So many people were questioning putting Bright up front in the closing moments of the match but it paid off massively. It’ll be interesting to see what the manager says, she should be facing the press shortly.A great moment for the team who have struggled for form over the past few years. Wiegman has done unbelievably well since taking the helm in 2021. The breakthrough star of the tournament has been named as Spain’s Athenea del Castillo - very much deserved. England players are putting medals around each other’s neck ahead of the trophy lift.The only side not to claim a win was Germany and Canada and Spain only bagged a victory each. This sets up such an exciting stage for the Euros! Trophy ceremony to come ...“This is just the beginning. It wasn’t pretty out there but it’s another element to our game that we can win dirty. “We’re not bothered who scores, it’s just about getting it in the back of the net. “We have shown that we can win”They came into this tournament without 12 players due to injury and Covid. They held Spain to a draw, lost 1-0 to Canada and suffered a late defeat to England. And my, oh my Magull’s strike is something so promising for the visitors. Imagine Magull at the Euros when all of their star players return. The Euros are going to be amazing.Bright, Player of the Match, embraced Sarina Wiegman and you can just see what it means to them.A great strike from White in the first match was cancelled out by arguably the goal of the tournament from Magull. The second half saw both teams playing well with shots coming in. But it was England’s Bright who broke the deadlock and Kirby added the extra. A breath-taking match, I am so excited for the Euros!She smacks it home and seals a cracking match. Germany look desperate to keep England to two goals as Russo and Hemp look to shoot. The defence does enough to quell the dangerThe defender has played well in defence and came through for England when they needed her.  She’s also the joint top tournament scorer with Spain’s Alexia Putellas.The visitors look to equalise one again, Rall is doing so well to battle with Kirby. The Chelsea star, though, ends up on the better end and wins a free kick. Germany make a change as Buhl comes off for Cerci. What a match this has been!Emma Hayes mentioned the Manchester City star didn’t have enough awareness but she seemed to get it just in time. What a finish from Bright as well! The camera has panned to Spain who are not happy with that score.And what a decision that is! A cracking ball from Hemp sees Bright tap home. But it’s the visitors who look dangerous, Brand almost scores from a cracking header. This is so tense!Possession pinballs around the midfield and it ends in a break in play. England take the opportunity to bring Russo and Toone on for White and Bronze.England have a free kick and Kirby takes it. Bright gets a head to it but it goes wide. Wow, what a stressful few minutes!According to my Twitter sources, Germany were pinging the ball in the box but couldn’t quite get a shot away. England countered as Kirby saw a shot rattle the woodwork. Russo on shortly.Hagel and Dallmann are on for Dongus and Magull. Interesting move taking Magull off. The goal-scorer and such a bright spark to this second half.I’m relieved and frustrated to update you that it isn’t my internet causing the issue with my feed, it’s ITV Hub cutting out. I’m hoping it’s because so many fans are trying to watch the match. If you want to vent Hub frustrations to me, I’m all ears! Email or send me a tweet!She is on her feet and is staying on the pitch. My feed has decided to cut again, the joy. I’ll be all over any updates while my laptop decides to play ball though! But Hemp is with the ball again and this time shoots, it’s saved by Frohms and she was offside anyway. England make their first change as Stanway comes off for Parris.She makes up for it by winning a free kick. Stanway on the kick again ...The kick goes to Bronze but her pass is cut out.  This is turning into a slightly sloppy performance from England now. Germany are really building and the mistakes are seeping into the Lionesses game. This may be the brightest Germany has played this tournament.England counter well with Hemp crossing to White but Feldkamp shuts down the attack - a great defensive move.Walsh passes sublime ball to Hemp who wins a corner. Stanway plays it short and low which is easy to read from Germany. Interesting the Lionesses have switched who takes the kick. Greenwood had been the taker.England look to build but they spill the ball in Germany’s half, a dangerous spell here for the hosts. Brand gets it into the box but a sloppy pass sees England full of relief.Buhl has had a bright game so far and continues to be a big threat.Hemp looks to break but it just gets away from her. Williamson gets the ball and the crowd encourages her to shoot, she doesn’t. It’s a high tempo star with only one change at half-time with Brand on for Germany.England need to score again in order to win the Arnold Clark Cup. If Germany hold them to a draw or bag a win, the cup will go to Spain. In other news, did I grab another Skittles bag in the break? Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t.White scored a beautiful opener after sustained England pressure. The hosts continued to impress and an error from Greenwood led to a German freekick. Magull then struck the perfect freekick, it superbly curled into goal with Roebuck able to do little to stop it. We are all square!There are two minutes added. Feel like my stress levels are back to normal now, phew the panic when my feed cut was very real!Gutted I missed that goal in real time, it was an absolute stunner. The equaliser means as things stand, Spain will win the tournament.Magull curled the shot straight into goal, now we have a match on our hands!"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"barristers say they are losing out on work to retired judges","story":"Former chief justice Frank Clarke is among the retired judges who are engaged in mediations andor arbitrations. Photograph: Tom HonanStruggling barristers are losing out as a number of retired senior judges on substantial pensions are securing lucrative mediation work, The  has been told.Former chief justice Frank Clarke, who retired last October, former Court of Appeal judge Michael Peart and a former High Court judge, Paul Gilligan, are among the retired judges who are engaged in mediations andor arbitrations.Their engagement is causing disquiet among some barristers who say they are losing out on an important source of remuneration in difficult times.The retired judges are being suggested, mainly by the big law firms, as mediators to carry out the “more lucrative” mediations in medical negligence and commercial cases, according to a barrister with considerable mediation experience.Such mediations would command fees of between €7,500 to €10,000 but sources believe the retired judges may be getting in excess of that.“It seems that the larger firms are suggesting the judges as mediators because they like the gravitas that goes with them,” the barrister said. “It probably impresses some clients.“The level of disquiet about this is justified,” she said. “Retired judges get substantial pensions and the rest of us are trying to make a living. Many barristers who would otherwise get these mediations are struggling.”Pension entitlements“A growing number of cases, particularly in the medical negligence area, are going to mediation and these would be an important source of income for barristers who are accredited mediators,” another barrister said. “It’s been hard enough to make a living over the past few years, the fact this work is going to retired judges instead of barristers doesn’t help.”Retired judges have regularly undertaken work, in the past and to date, chairing tribunals or inquiries. Because that is work for the State, it is subject to pension abatement clauses, meaning the remuneration of the retired judges for such work would be in line with their annual pension entitlements.Mediation has grown in popularity in recent years and its consideration has been recommended by judges dealing with a range of cases, including employment, commercial and professional negligence disputes.Mr Clarke (70) was permitted to rejoin the Bar following a vote late last year by the Library Committee of the Bar Council, which controls admissions to the Law Library. As a result, he reverted to the title of senior counsel, which he had attained in 1985. His entry on the Law Library website lists arbitration as his area of practice.Mr Peart was a reluctant retiree in October 2019 from the Court of Appeal in advance of his 70th birthday. He was appointed to that court in 2014. He was the first solicitor to be appointed as a judge of the High Court where he served between 2002 and 2014.He is currently an arbitrator at Armistice Dispute Resolution Services, which describes itself as an Irish dispute resolution technology platform created to facilitate the resolution of commercial disputes. Mr Peart is described as an accredited mediator whose areas of expertise include alternative dispute resolution, arbitrationmediation, construction disputes and employment law disputes.Mr Gilligan, aged in his early 70s, served as a judge of the High Court between 2003 and 2017 and managed the chancery ision of that court for several years. He was appointed as a judge of the Court of Appeal in late 2017 and served there until his retirement in May 2018. He also served as president of the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary.A qualified mediator, he was among the speakers at a Law Society webinar last April which addressed the benefits of mediation for lawyers. His address focused on commercial litigation, pre-trial mediation and the aspect of legal costs.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cycling ireland president and two board directors step down","story":"Cycling Ireland said the departures ‘will leave sufficient board members to enable the board to be re-constituted’.  Photograph: Bryan KeaneInphoThe board of Cycling Ireland will be reconstituted after a bitter governance row came to a head on Wednesday with the departure of the body’s president Liam Collins and two long-standing board directors. Mr Collins, president only since November, had become embroiled in a dispute with other board members after the body admitted using “false quotations” in a 2020 claim for a Government grant. In a statement, the outgoing president said there had been “concerted opposition” to his agenda. “There have been irreconcilable – and much publicised – issues however at Board level, and it appears it is not possible to pursue the work I had intended to,” he said. The other directors who stepped down were Eugene Moriarty, the treasurer, and Anthony Mitchel, board secretary. Their exit follows the resignation last week of three independent board members.Cycling Ireland said the departures “will leave sufficient board members to enable the board to be re-constituted” with the support of Sport Ireland, the State supervisor of national sports governing bodies. Although board rows originated in tension over the grant claim, Sport Ireland said last week that a “new issue” emerged. The issue in question was a disagreement over the terms of a December partnership deal with EvoPro Racing, a cycling team. Six nomineesCycling Ireland has named six nominees to fill board vacancies: barristers Louise Reilly and Susan Ahern World Cyclo Cross official Gary McIlroy Ulster Cycling nominee Claire Young and Munster Cycling nominee Dr Tom Daly. Emma Hunt-Duffy, head of marketing with fruit importer Fyffes, will rejoin the board after resigning last week. Solicitor Conor Campbell will continue as vice-president until the election of a new president at the body’s annual meeting in November. Matt McKerrow, the chief executive, said: “Cycling Ireland deserve a leadership which is unified and shares a crystal-clear vision and plan for the development of the sport.”The rows have prompted an Oireachtas committee to demand a hearing with Cycling Ireland on March 9th.“Recent developments within Cycling Ireland give me great cause for concern,” said Fine Gael TD Ciaran Cannon, a member of the Oireachtas committee on sport. Before the latest resignations, Mr Cannon said: “This is a national sporting body which continues to receive very substantial state funding, yet its governance structures seem to be exceptionally weak, with a level of disharmony amongst its leadership.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord normal service resumes in the groundhog d%C3%A1il","story":" Mary Lou McDonald and Micheál Martin are locked in a daily cycle of repetitive and increasingly bitter argument.  Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireGroundhog Dáil. A tale of two people in a national parliament stuck in a monotonous and unpleasant loop, forced to relive the same reality day after day after accursed day.Will it ever stop? Some might think it’s just a fantasy a scorching redemption story for our times which would probably translate very well into a successful movie script. Except this is no fanciful yarn.It’s Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald locked in a daily cycle of repetitive and increasingly bitter argument from which neither appears capable of escaping.And in Groundhog Dáil, there is no sign of redemption on the horizon.Boring versus Booming. McGrath militantly milk and water and Doherty more noise than deliberate niggle. They engaged vigorously over a familiar bone of contention (housing) yet the dynamic was different. No love lost for sure, but their encounter lacked the undercurrent of hostility and contempt which now characterises exchanges between the Taoiseach and the leader of the main Opposition party.On Wednesday normal service resumed in the Groundhog Dáil. Getting out on day release from combat duty only served to sharpen the needle between the two main protagonists.Mary Lou opened as usual with the housing crisis and they immediately went back to tearing up the same old ground using the same old attack clichés.Where the housing crisis is concerned, their private circular argument is generating more heat than light, going nowhere and achieving nothing. (Apart from feeding the constantly refreshing menu of Mary Lou’s punchy social media video clips.)On this most crucial public issue, the country’s two main leaders have rendered Leaders’ Questions pointless. But who is to blame?Mary Lou for deliberately baiting the Taoiseach with blatantly populist rhetoric or Micheál for unfailingly falling for it?Perhaps they should heed the advice of Bertie Ahern back in the day: “I don’t think it helps people to be throwing white elephants and red herrings at each other.”Or in the case of the Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leader, opening cupboards and flinging skeletons. Both sides, with arguable degrees of justification, plead provocation – Mary Lou says he won’t answer questions and Micheál says she’s putting political spin above a housing emergency.But in this increasingly tiresome double-act one thing is sure: there’s a pair of them in it.On this occasion Deputy McDonald brought up the long-running O’Devaney Gardens project in Dublin’s inner city, alleging that a developer is threatening to sell the houses to a vulture fund if the Government doesn’t pay an inflated price for them. She threw in all the trigger words. “Cuckoo funds...Hoovering up family homes...sweetheart tax deals...Fianna Fáil tent...the party of the brown envelope...molly-coddling developer friends...ordinary homeowners and renters skinned...”He batted back with what he repeatedly says is his firmly held view: “Housing is the single most urgent and important social issue facing our country at this point in time.”Then he outlined the Government’s Housing for All Strategy in detail, again, right down to it being “unprecedented in scale and investment”.‘Brass neck’That cut no ice with Mary Lou, who interrupted the Taoiseach’s reply on the O’Devaney Gardens issue with a wide-eyed reaction: “Wow! The brass neck.”Along with party colleagues, she continued interjecting for the remainder of his response. The Sinn Féin leader used her follow-up question to follow through on her assertion that Fianna Fáil is in cahoots with its developer “buddies” and facilitating tax deals for them “to the detriment of a generation locked out of home ownership”.Then Mary Lou unleashed the “c” word, excusing herself from having to actually stand up her charge of corruption with her opening words. “I don’t have the scope to recount the corruption,” she conveniently began, “the corrupted nature of your relationship with the people that I refer to.”And after informing the Taoiseach “you’re so myopic and limited in your view” she triumphantly rounded off her attack by telling him: “This is happening on YOUR watch. Those, my friend, are the facts.”He is not her friend. And going by the furious response, she is definitely not his.“You used the word corrupt there,” said Micheál quietly.“You are the last party to talk to anybody about corruption because your party corrupted public life...”“Ansbacher,” deadpanned the Sinn Féin leader.“...in this republic...”“Galway,” she drawled, taking a sip of water.“...for well on 40 years to a far greater degree than any other party in this country.”Things deteriorated from there.As Mary Lou smiled sweetly, he fumed: “You corrupted the moral code of our country and our society by the murder and mayhem that you perpetrated and that you still endorse, deputy. You still endorse it, you still support the narrative of murder and mayhem.”‘Pathetic’Across the floor, flanked by a full turnout of an unusually muted parliamentary party, Deputy McDonald shook her head.“And you also support the undermining of women that were raped by IRA volunteers and your party covered it up.”“Pathetic,” sighed the party leader as her indignant colleagues began to find their voices again. “Go ’way out of that.”“Do not come into this House, lead with your chin, telling this party that we were corrupt. We had faults and flaws, no doubt about it, but we faced up to it...you consistently try and rewrite the narrative, bury the truth about the level of corruption that your party engaged in.”And the more annoyed the Taoiseach became, the more Mary Lou repeated “you are pathetic, pathetic” while waving him away with little dismissive flaps of the hand.As Sinn Féin demanded answers on investment funds, Micheál leaned forward, eyes narrowed and demanded answers from Mary Lou. “You need to start answering some questions now.”“I will when I’m in your seat,” she retorted. “With pleasure.”The Taoiseach pressed on. “How are you going to double housing output?”All he got was more dismissive waves as Aengus Ó Snodaigh berated him for not answering his leader’s questions.As the latest unedifying episode of Groundhog Dáil stumbled to a bad tempered close, deputies from other parties watched on, leaving the two parties to their never-ending squabble.Richard Boyd Barrett, arms clasped across his chest, rocked back and forth, shaking his head.Finally, mercifully, the Ceann Comhairle called on the Labour leader to deliver some welcome light relief.Alan Kelly got to his feet. “The prospect of a full-blown war in Ukraine is edging ever closer...”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with

putin power","story":"There are plenty of mysteries surrounding the character, history and motivations of Vladimir Putin but, over the 23 years he’s spent as a world leader, we have at least grown used to one unassailable fact: nothing he does is accidental. The weightlifting videos, the military exercises, the horseback-riding without a shirt – everything the Russian president presents to the world is about image, and the messages aren’t subtle. In fact, subtlety would be a waste – he’s a drama queen at heart. It has never seemed coincidental that Vladislav Surkov, one of the founding fathers of Putinism and once a key figure within the administration, trained as a theatre director until he was sacked for fighting. The plots aren’t always tight, but they’re certainly tense. In recent days, as photos of Putin holding failed meetings to discuss the Ukraine crisis have held front pages around the globe, the image-making has been as intentional as ever. Sometimes it’s in the little details, sometimes it’s hidden in the backdrop, sometimes it’s in the massive, massive table, but every image tells us a little more about his grip on power.Picture 1: The Kremlin meeting of the Security Council1. The venueVladimir Putin has a lot of rooms he could use for meetings (there are 700 in the Kremlin Grand Palace alone), and everybody present at Monday’s gathering of top security officials could easily have squeezed into the usual cabinet room. As it was, he convened them in the vast, grandiloquent Hall of the Order of St Catherine.It could be a hygiene precaution for the deeply Covid-phobic leader, but unlike Emmanuel Macron or Olaf Scholz, it seems unlikely those in the room wouldn’t have acquiesced to a PCR, so this was all about the photo-op in the former throne room of the Russian Empresses.  In the past it has also been the venue for Thatcher meeting Gorbachov, Nixon meeting Brezhnev, and Putin\u0027s annexing of Crimea. Usually, it is used for peaceful state receptions, occasional press conferences and high-profile international negotiations. Not internal matters and definitely not with the bizarre seating arrangement of Monday’s meeting. This was classic Putin set-dressing. 2. The set-upWhy are all these senior officials in the Russian government – including the spy chief and iniduals with decades of loyalty to Putin – arranged like the audition scene from The Producers? The answer, of course, is for maximum pressure and pantomime – making it crystal clear that this may be a government in name, but only one man is calling the shots. Yesterday morning, footage of Putin rendering Sergei Naryshkin, chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, a quivering wreck by barking at him across this echoing hall in front of his peers, went viral. Putin would be absolutely delighted with that result.3. The watchAs any action movie auteur could tell you, there is no allegory for urgency quite like a literal close up of a ticking clock. And in this meeting, Putin took off his (potentially Blancpain Grande Date Aqua Lung, a favourite from his luxury collection) wristwatch part way through, and placed it in front of him as you might in a GCSE exam. This is a man famous for being hours late, who lets meetings run on half the night, and is occasionally accused of editing footage to fit a more convenient time-frame – like yesterday, when some onlookers noticed the watches of those in attendance didn’t always line up with the reported time. The message? Chop chop, people, I have things to do. Later in the night, we found out what...Picture 2: The televised address1. The terrifying deskThere are a few standout things to notice about the office from which Putin gave his lengthy televised address on Monday night. The totally blank desk, the screensaver showing the outside of the very building he’s in (no offence intended, anybody whose lockscreen is their own house), the menacing white button that may or may not be connected to his nuclear arsenal. Is that a lesser-spotted Amstrad ‘e-mailer’ phone in front of the computer? What is that massive television monitor next to his PC for – watching the History Channel’s Ice Road Truckers while pretending to work? When saying something terrifying, like declaring an invasion, it’s good to offer distractions.2. The phonesDespite being a former spy, Putin is also an inveterate technophobe, who reportedly hates mobile phones and computers, preferring briefing folders, secure landlines and pen and paper. It was said that eight years ago, when US agencies attempted to figure out what was going on inside his camp during Russia’s takeover of Crimea, they were met by nothing but silence. Nothing to listen in on, nothing to intercept, nothing to give the game away.What we didn’t know was that he liked old-fashioned phones so much as to have three on his desk, including one with only one button in the middle, and what looks like Dr Dre’s mixing desk underneath them all. “Does President Putin run his own switchboard?” comedian David Mitchell asked on Twitter yesterday. Well, does he?3. Those pot plantsIt’s difficult to imagine Putin tending to this pair of pot plants, which look like they may belong to the dieffenbachia family and stand awkwardly in an otherwise devastatingly lifeless room, but he is a lover of the natural world, and may have even insisted on their appointment to that eminent corner of the room behind his bank of phones. Once, he even wrote that he likes “events in which fauna take part”. Nicholas II had Rasputin Putin has these two. 4. The face of the organisationThis isn’t a tried and tested theory, but could it be that, over the past two decades, Vladimir Putin has attempted to match the growth of Russia with an equally rapacious and worrying expansion of his own face via the medium of industrial-strength fillers? Photographs of him in 1998 look like a different man. He is nothing if not committed to visual metaphors.Picture 3: Another big table1. More oversized furnitureMuch has been made of Putin’s shuffleboard table diplomacy. Last week’s meeting with Emmanuel Macron, which might as well have been conducted on Zoom as they were effectively sitting in different countries, resulted in a vast international effort – to create memes. And here he is again, at his usual cabinet table, making absolutely sure that foreign minister Sergey Lavrov couldn’t touch him with a bargepole, let alone any accidental spittle.Putin, projecting his Tsarist side as ever, is at the head of the table, with Lavrov, who has been in his post since 2004, stuck down one side, only just fitting into frame. Putin is cautiously distant from even his most loyal subjects this is not a man with deputies as we understand it. As the saying goes, keep your friends really far away, and your enemies even further. 2. The rogue applianceIn Britain, Henry the Hoover manages to creep into any room he wishes – nobody questions that little suck-up’s face. In Russia it appears his counterpart is a mysterious white appliance on wheels – could it be a two-bar heater? An emergency trouser press? A defibrillator, for if the tension all gets a bit much? It was there behind Putin at the Macron meeting, and now here it is again, lurking beside a small side table, pumping out hot air or poison or Dettol or nothing. 3. His favourite chairAlways consistent, you will notice this (quite uncomfortable-looking, and presumably low-slung, given he is 5ft 7ins) style of chair in almost all Putin’s Kremlin photographs. It may not be the same one, but we do know he is a creature of habit.When he became prime minister and allowed Dmitry Medvedev to be president from 2008 to 2012, Putin reportedly kept sitting in his same old chair, on the left of the president’s office, while Medvedev took the right, usually reserved for guests. A first photograph of the pair meeting to discuss the cabinet sent a clear signal to world leaders and investors alike: the boss might be different, but the chairman’s the same.4. Yet more buttonsIs it possible that these random, chunky coloured buttons in the foreground don’t do something nefarious? Sure, they probably turn on the air con. But do the Kremlin photographers, and by extension Putin himself, know we will ask the question? Also yes. It’s all about perception.More from NewsUkraine-Russia crisis: US warns Kyiv of \u0026#39imminent\u0026#39 full scale invasionRishi Sunak: I’ll slash the tax burden to bring prosperity back to BritainRoyal audience with The One Show kicks off 100-day countdown to Platinum JubileeDivine intervention?

Perhaps. But reality dictates that we work to buy the crucial stuff that isn’t free, like wine, saucepans and loo roll. And to bankroll the things that might purport to be free but aren’t, like the NHS, education and lateral flow tests.Right now some people are kicking up a fuss about the end of free Covid testing. How dare they cost money? In truth, they have always cost money – an eye-watering taxpayer-funded £2 billion a month. With hindsight, we should have started paying for them sooner, at a nominal price, just to remind us that these things don’t grow on trees. Cheap maybe, but not free.In fairness to Boris, the emphasis back in early 2020 was on saving lives rather than money. But it doesn’t take a Nostradamus to predict what happens when you pretend for years that a “public service” is free. Once reality hits and the question of cost returns, people will go into a tremendous huff.Because here in Britain, the very word “freebie” has the pleasure centres in our brain lighting up like a pinball machine. The stand-up comedian Jack Whitehall riffs very amusingly that our beloved NHS is predicated on us donating blood in return for a free biscuit, and the words “free bar” prompt even the most respectable of citizens to behave like parched sailors on shore leave.The American psychologist Professor Dan Ariely approaches the issue from the perspective of behavioural economics in his book Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. “We often pay too much when we pay nothing,” he writes. “Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is Free! we forget the downside because Free! gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is.”This tendency to overload on free things just because they are there, be it pens, mugs, an umbrella stamped with a company logo or lateral flow tests, is something of a national flaw.I am not immune. Sure, the days when motoring journalists were “gifted” sports cars in return for glowing reviews are long gone, but my cupboards are groaning with rubbish that detracts rather than enhances my life: 16 lanyards, a pond periscope, branded flip-flops, a banner with my face on it (don’t ask). I once tussled with a colleague over a gross, rubberised ball of belly fat sent in by a diet company to illustrate how much weight the average menopausal woman piles on at Christmas. I lost. It still rankles.By contrast, I recall once attending a conference and observing a soignée French woman inspecting a plate of finger food. I gauchely reassured her that it was free. She tilted her head to one side, glanced down at her exquisitely toned upper arms and responded with withering graciousness. “Ah, but the price would be mine.”Needless to say, she somehow resisted the curling coronation chicken sandwiches. I wolfed down my body weight. What can I say? They were free.Thankfully, I am able, just about, to handle the cost to my wardrobe and my health. But a country addicted to taxpayer-funded freebies might have a more difficult time recovering. Soon we will have to accept that two years of record government borrowing and spending will come at a cost to our payslips. It was never free.More from NewsUkraine-Russia crisis: US warns Kyiv of \u0026#39imminent\u0026#39 full scale invasionRishi Sunak: I’ll slash the tax burden to bring prosperity back to BritainRoyal audience with The One Show kicks off 100-day countdown to Platinum JubileeDivine intervention?

Or, to be precise, two second homes – the metals tycoon ides his time between Beechwood House, a £50 million mansion in north London, and Sutton Place, a Tudor pile in Surrey once owned by Jean Paul Getty.Yet like many of the Russian billionaires with boltholes in so-called “Londongrad”, he seems equally comfortable with life back in Vladimir Putin’s Moscow, where the Russian leader is a personal acquaintance. As he once told Forbes magazine: “I am proud that I know Putin, and the fact that everybody does not like him is not Putin’s problem.”Usmanov is not alone. According to Russian opposition groups, there are between 30 and 50 oligarchs with links to the Kremlin who spend at least part of their time living the high-life in Britain. Their billions have, for more than two decades, helped fuel a boom in private school fees and property prices across the capital and beyond. Law firms, auditors, architects and building firms have grown rich on their custom. Extravagant restaurants, boutiques, supercar showrooms and nightspots owe their very existence to them.Now, however, the Russian gravy train may be about to come to a stop. On Tuesday, in response to Putin ordering troops into Ukraine’s breakaway regions, Boris Johnson announced a raft of economic sanctions (freezing assets and preventing travel to and from the UK) against Moscow, hitting five Russian banks and three Kremlin-linked oligarchs: oil trader Gennady Timchenko, construction magnate Igor Rotenberg, and his uncle Boris, who is also Putin’s judo sparring partner. But is it enough? Britain has, after all, pledged numerous crackdowns before, following the poisoning of the KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, Crimea’s annexation in 2014 and the Salisbury Novichok attack in 2018. On each occasion, action has never lived up to bluster and there are many who think this time will be no different.At Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer put the question bluntly: “The Prime Minister promised that in the event of an invasion he would unleash a full package of sanctions. If not now, then when?”Britain’s love affair with Russian money goes back to the Nineties, when Moscow’s newly-emerging business class began buying flats in Knightsbridge, frequenting Harrods and Ascot, and enrolling offspring at our public schools. A blind eye was turned to concerns that their money came from legally-questionable privatisations of Soviet-era utilities. Russia was no longer seen as a threat. Plus, the inflows of cash to London were immense – hundreds of billions, according to some estimates.It is not just cash that has been invested in so-called Londongrad. Russian reputations have also been polished, courtesy of London-based PR and libel law firms, whom the oligarchs pay generous fees to protect both their image – and the Kremlin’s.Even Russian investments in British football clubs have been seen as an attempt to buy influence among the British public, although, last year, Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich successfully sued over claims that he had bought the club on Putin’s orders. Boris Johnson mistakenly told Parliament on Tuesday that Abramovich was already under sanctions, later saying that he “misspoke”. Britain has already sanctioned some 180 Russians, mostly in the wake of the annexation of Crimea. But far more could be done, according to Vladimir Ashurkov, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, the campaign group set up by jailed Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny.Last year his group, which specialises in embarrassing revelations about the Kremlin elite’s riches, sent a list of 35 prominent Russians to the Foreign Office that it recommended for sanctions. The latest ones are “so far pretty lightweight – again, strong on rhetoric but little on action,” Mr Ashurkov told The  this week. “The British Government has access to all the public info about the perpetrators, plus non-public information through the banking system, but so far it just seems there hasn’t been enough political will to take it on. The UK talks about further sanctions if Russia actually invades Ukraine, but hasn’t Russia done enough damage already?”While Ashurkov’s list focuses on those Russians alleged to be closest to Putin, other Londongrad residents are conspicuous simply because of their sheer wealth. Phosphate magnate Andrey Guryev, for example, owns Witanhurst, a 65-room £300 million Highgate mansion that is London’s largest private residence after Buckingham Palace. In 2018, the US treasury named him on a list of 100 oligarchs close to  Putin, although he was not sanctioned.Also on that list was metals giant Vladimir Lisin, named by Forbes in 2020 as Russia’s richest man, and current laird of Aberuchill Castle, a 3,000 acre Perthshire estate. In 2012, The  reported how a container ship owned by his business empire was alleged to have delivered containers of weapons to the Assad regime in Syria. His firm said it had no knowledge of the containers’ contents.Small wonder then, that Londongrad – also known as Moscow-on-Thames – has become a tourist attraction in its own right. Kleptocracy Tours, run by anti-corruption campaigners, takes passengers on a bus trip from Highgate via St John’s Wood to Belgravia, pointing out mansions belonging to Kremlin cronies and their extended families. So many have homes in Belgravia’s Eaton Square that it has become a favourite address for Russian cryptocurrency scammers, who use it to give their fake firms a high-end veneer.Russian exiles have also been lavish with their cash through donations to the Conservative Party, which some believe explains why sanctions have not been tougher. The Tories have received more than £3 million from Soviet-born donors, including £1.7 million from financier Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband once served in Putin’s cabinet. At the Conservative Party’s winter ball two years ago, she also made the winning £45,000 auction bid for a tennis match with Boris Johnson.In practice, the government often has limited powers to tackle oligarchs, who use complex shell companies and batteries of lawyers to keep their fortunes from scrutiny. In 2018, as part of its new “McMafia” legislation, Downing Street introduced unexplained wealth orders – forcing targeted iniduals to prove their fortunes were legitimate – but they have been prohibitively expensive to enforce. A failed case against a wealthy Kazakh family, which ended in a protracted court challenge, cost the National Crime Agency £1.5 million in legal bills – a third of its international anti-corruption budget.Crucially, Britain has also so far failed to close a legal loophole allowing foreign buyers of British properties to hide their identities through offshore firms and trusts, despite promising to do so in 2016. Transparency International estimates that some 85,000 UK properties are owned anonymously this way, with at least £1.5 billion worth by Russians suspected of corruption or Kremlin links.Most of that property money is probably now beyond trace, according to Neil Dooley, a partner with experience in Russian litigation for London law firm Steptoe. “It is very difficult to police as you can buy a property in the name of a trust or nominees, and nobody will ever know,” he says. “I don’t think there is much appetite to close the loophole, partly because of the policing difficulties, and partly because there’s too much money at stake.”Nonetheless, with America and the European Union now wielding their own sanction sticks, Britain faces increasing international pressure to close the door further on wealthy Russians. On Tuesday night, US president Joe Biden unveiled new sanctions on two state-owned Russian banks and five members of Putin’s inner circle, warning of further measures. Germany announced that it would halt certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia – potentially a far weightier sanction, given the country’s dependence on Russian gas.Other more serious measures proposed by both America and Britain include cutting Russian firms’ access to dollars and Stirling, and even barring Moscow from Swift, the worldwide banking payments network.Whether Putin will be deterred is another matter. His regime has already sanction-proofed itself via its “Fortress Russia” strategy, saving up central bank reserves of $600 billion (£442bn). Thus girded, will he even care if a few of his inner circle lose their remaining homes and holiday breaks in London?“I can’t predict whether it will be the final straw, but if the West really works on this together now, Putin’s position within the Russian elite will become that more difficult,” said Ashurkov.Or will it? Asked once if sanctions could lead to Russia’s business elite ditching Putin, the oligarch Igor Shuvalov declared: “If a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader. We will survive any hardship in the country – we will eat less food, use less electricity.”For a man as fond of Londongrad’s good life as Shuvalov, that was perhaps a bold claim. The question now is whether Britain will choose to put it to the test.More from NewsUkraine-Russia crisis: US warns Kyiv of \u0026#39imminent\u0026#39 full scale invasionRishi Sunak: I’ll slash the tax burden to bring prosperity back to BritainRoyal audience with The One Show kicks off 100-day countdown to Platinum JubileeDivine intervention?

It is either ine intervention, or there is a much more mundane reason that none of us are aware of.“We just cannot explain it. Not only is the mechanism working again, but the clock tells the correct time on all the faces.Little did Mr Daniel know that three days earlier, a pair of local bellringers had decided to have a go at fixing it themselves.Ricky Harwood, 47, a local cheesemaker, had been carrying out maintenance of the church’s 10 bells last Wednesday with the help of 15-year-old Jay Foley, as part of their role as members of the Grimsby Ringers.When they peered inside the wooden boxes containing the components for the clock, they discovered three dead pigeons “wrapped up” in the cogs.After removing the carcasses, the pair set about recalibrating the chimes and the hands. They then lubricated the mechanism that powers the clock, using a grease gun they had to hand and a small can of WD-40 that Mr Harwood bought from the local shop.While Mr Harwood undid the wingnuts, which releases the hands from the mechanism to allow them to be worked independently, Jay - who plans to study engineering - would run up and down the 100 steps of the church tower calling out over the phone the time shown outside on the clock\u0027s four faces.After three hours of work, the pair then left the minster without telling a soul of their good deed.Mr Harwood, who was first taught how to repair a church clock as an 11-year-old bellringer, told The : “I like fixing things and I’m a curious person and Jay likes taking things apart.“We thought we would have just a little look, it seemed a shame not to while we were there rooting around in the muck.“We gave it some WD-40, a bit more tender loving care and a bit of coaxing.The father of three, who started a new career as a cheesemaker for the Lincolnshire Poacher Cheese company last month, added: “Whether you are religious or not, I think people listen to the bells, the clock, it\u0027s a sign that the church is still there, isn’t it?“A sign that someone is still there, someone still cares. It maybe does show the substance of the society around us is starting to dwindle a bit, I think it gives people hope.”Jay, who plans to study engineering at the Humber Maritime College, said: “There is a message, I would say just go for where you want to go and if you see something that interests you, don’t stop, just continue with it.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia crisis: US warns Kyiv of \u0026#39imminent\u0026#39 full scale invasionRishi Sunak: I’ll slash the tax burden to bring prosperity back to BritainRoyal audience with The One Show kicks off 100-day countdown to Platinum JubileeTerror and panic on the streets of Ukraine as Grad rockets once again fall from the skyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"horror zoombombing pushing jewish life underground","story":"We were 10 minutes into my synagogue’s Zoom quiz when it was interrupted with a horrific display of child sexual abuse, with images I will never be able to unsee.It was May 2020 and that very same evening a friend told me her mother had been distraught when an online shiva, the Jewish mourning period after burial, for her relative had been disrupted with images of swastikas and people shouting “Heil Hitler”.I soon discovered that what we had experienced was Zoombombing, when internet vandals hijack video calls with offensive material. And this week I learnt these online attacks helped fuel a record high of anti-Semitic incidents in the UK last year.The Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that monitors anti-Semitism, recorded 2,255 anti-Jewish hate incidents in 2021, the highest number it has ever recorded, and a 34 per cent increase from 2020. Of these, 173 were violent assaults and 16 were Zoombombings, contributing to 552 online anti-Semitic incidents overall in 2021.“Before the pandemic, we’d never heard of Zoombombing but in the first week of lockdown, two incidents were reported to us,” says CST policy director Dave Rich. “In normal times, you can’t wander into a synagogue or a Jewish community event because there’s security on the door. Moving communal life online meant people had access to Jews in a way they hadn’t previously.”As a result, my tiny community of 280,000 or so has had to learn to treat online events as if they were physical ones. When Rich says “security on the door” he refers to the guards we have employed to protect our schools, our community centres and synagogues for as long as anyone can remember. We are more than used to looking out for ourselves.After my synagogue quiz was Zoombombed, my rabbi reported the incident to the CST, the police and Zoom, and cyber security was tightened. And it was far from relaxed before. Now the time and dates of our meetings, our ID and links are only shared on the community’s weekly email and a private Facebook group, which is tightly monitored.Cyber-security expert James Bore says: “Whatever precautions we take, Facebook remains a pressing problem. It takes just one post from someone who has not bothered to set their privacy settings properly for information about a private or communal event to get out.”Or, as Rich puts it: “It’s the online equivalent of leaving the door open.”But even if you are careful about your privacy settings, or limit certain posts to certain people, some of your so-called friends might have fake profiles, says Bore. “When people want to target particular groups, they will often create a fake profile, post some reasonable stuff and then sit back and quietly gather information.”And once they have the information they want, it is a short step to Zoombombing. “It takes very little technical knowledge I could teach someone how to do it in five minutes. You just need some virtual camera software, a nasty video and the link to the event you want to disrupt,” says Bore.So easy, in fact, that while Jews have been a particular target for Zoombombers, anyone can fall victim to the malice. In America the problem became so widespread, the FBI issued a warning about it in March 2020. The pernicious phenomenon was particularly acute in virtual classrooms and lecture halls where the n-word appeared on screens and racist slurs were made against black students. In these shores, child abuse videos have interrupted corporate meetings, gym sessions, online cheese-and-wine tasting events and support group videos for people giving up alcohol, after meeting details were shared on social media.Because not all Zoombombing stems from racist and extremist views. “I hate to say it, but some people disrupt online events because they think it’s funny,” says Bore.But when Jews and other minority groups are targeted, it is with the specific intention of causing them harm, he says. “These people are trying to hurt and upset it’s not that different from stopping someone in the street and screaming in their face. It’s emotional violence.”Although the attackers generally use the language and tactics of the far Right, they aren’t usually known extremists or members of established far-Right groups, says Rich. “They shout ‘Heil Hitler’ because they know that’s what you shout at Jews. In the main, these people are anti-social trolls rather than formal groups people who are already caught up in online troll culture”They are also mostly single men under the age of 30 who have problems operating socially, says Bore. “And they tend to think everyone hates them. It makes them particularly susceptible to Facebook’s algorithms, which are built to encourage people to lean towards ever-increasing emotional and extreme content because that’s what creates discussion and engagement on the platform.”Plus, you get outpourings of admiration on Facebook, or “love-bombing” as it has been dubbed, which for social misfits can be very powerful. “You’re someone who gets criticised for your out-there opinions. You go on Facebook and your network tells you what you said what was right. They say you’re being criticised because you are telling the truth, and they feed you more information about Jews or other minority groups. It’s one way people become extremists.”Meanwhile, for those of us who have experienced anti-Semitic Zoombombing, it feels like a new and powerful way to spread the hate in a year that was already very difficult for Jews in Britain. The record-high tally of anti-Semitic incidents last year included Islamic State-style convoys sweeping across north London blasting “F*** the Jews, rape their daughters” on loudspeakers, and the highest volume of university-related hate ever recorded, half of it erupting during and after the Israel-Gaza conflict in MayAfter the first few incidents of Zoombombing were reported to the CST, the charity acted quickly, producing online security guidance information that it disseminated across the Jewish community and also shared with other ethnic and minority ethnic groups. “It happens less than it did at the beginning of the pandemic, but there are still cases and as long as parts of Jewish communal life remains online, I’m sure they will continue,” says Rich. “Once anti-Semites discover a new tactic, they keep trying it.”In fact, Manchester Reform Synagogue – where Ridley Road, the television drama about Jewish opposition to British fascism in the 1960s, was filmed – was Zoombombed as recently as October. “Halfway through our Friday night service, during a song about liberation, the intruders started shouting and put a swastika and other dreadful racist images on the screen,” says Rabbi Robyn Ashworth-Steen. “We kicked them out immediately, but they kept trying to get back in. We were very shaken by the incident – and we are used to seeing far-Right gatherings near the synagogue and receiving anti-Semitic phone calls. But this made us feel particularly violated.”Which is of course exactly what the Zoombombers want. “It is a very effective way of causing disruption and upset,” says Bore. “We can’t say exactly how many people are involved in Zoombombing, but we can say that unless there is legislation to make social companies act more responsibly, be more accountable, it is not going to go away.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia crisis: US warns Kyiv of \u0026#39imminent\u0026#39 full scale invasionRishi Sunak: I’ll slash the tax burden to bring prosperity back to BritainRoyal audience with The One Show kicks off 100-day countdown to Platinum JubileeDivine intervention?

Mopac (the Mayor\u0027s Office for Policing and Crime) have been briefed on these events and they have been under investigation for four years.Only a few weeks ago, the Mayor was a vocal supporter of the commissioner in a tripartite meeting with the Home Secretary. Hence my surprise at what\u0027s happened.He expressed deep disappointment at the conduct of the Mayor, adding: I\u0027ve written to the Home Secretary to ask her to have a review carried out of the events that have taken place.Following the publication of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) report, Mr Khan put Dame Cressida on notice and warned her she had just days and weeks to come up with a plan to root out racism and misogyny, as well as restore public trust and confidence in the force.A City Hall source said the Mayor did not receive the full IOPC report, including the messages exchanged, until three working days before it was published.But after receiving the plan, the Mayor let it be known he was unhappy with the proposals and Dame Cressida resigned.Sir Stephen said when the commissioner had sought feedback from the Mayor about her proposals and how she might improve the plan, she had been stonewalled.He added: I feel sad for my boss that her police career and lifetime of public services ended in this way.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Biden could set up a call or meeting at any time but there were no firm plans yet for a summit.  It comes following a flurry of late-night calls between French President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin. Mr Macronaposs office and the White House said details of a possible summit could be hammered out during a meeting on Thursday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The development offers a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution but Western leaders still fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent.More than , Russian troops are massed around Ukraineaposs borders, according to US estimates, with , along the countryaposs eastern flank and tens of thousands alongside Belarusian troops in the north.Fears have been mounting that Russia will stage  flag attacks to justy further aggression against Ukraine. A UK source told the Mirror that they believed an invasion was going to happen in the next  to  hours.  Boris Johnson warned at the weekend that Europe could be on the brink of the biggest war since  as he travelled to Munich for a crunch security conference.In a call with Mr Macron on Sunday night, the Prime Minister welcomed the prospect of a diplomatic solution and urged Mr Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine’s border. A No spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister noted that President Putin’s commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution. The Prime Minister stressed that Ukraine’s voice must be central in any discussions.

But concrete steps have not been set out. Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsThe Government has been criticised for failing to set out a concrete strategy to tackle disparities in maternity care. Dozens of experts have noted black women are % more likely to experience a miscarriage than white women. And women who live in deprived areas are more likely to suffer a stillbirth than their richer counterparts. Clea Harmer, CEO of stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, told the Mirror the Government should have taken a mixed approach of gathering more research via the taskforce and helping ethnic mums now. The risk of whether your baby will die or not at the moment depends on who you are, where you live, what your background is, which is just not acceptable.  Your postcode should not have anything to do with whether your baby dies or not. It comes as Minister for Women’s health Maria Caulfield confirmed the launch of the Maternity Disparities Taskforce which is expected to examine why ethnic minority women, poorer women and their babies have worse health outcomes. Ms Caulfield said: “For too long disparities have persisted which mean women living in deprived areas or from ethnic monitory backgrounds are less likely to get the care they need, and worse, lose their child. “We must do better to understand and address the causes of this. “The Maternity Disparities Taskforce will help level up maternity care across the country, bringing together a wide range of experts to deliver real and ambitious change so we can improve care for all women, and I will be monitoring progress closely.” Labour have questioned why the Government has not issued urgent and meaningful action. In the Commons, Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities Taiwo Owatemi said: We have a vision document and our task force to increase the understanding of the problem, but no concrete steps to solve [disparities]. The Conservatives have promised as promised us the conservatives have had  years Mr. Speaker, when are they going to act  Feryal Clark, Shadow Health Minister added: It is shocking that black women are less likely to receive the care they need when pregnant and, tragically, more likely to lose their child.After  years of Tory mismanagement of our NHS, inequalities are widening and maternity care is getting worse.Labour will introduce a new Race Equality Act to tackle the structural inequalities which have long existed in our society.  The NHS set out a national ambition to halve the rates of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal death and brain injuries by , with a % reduction by . The Tories published a vision for womenaposs health last December, which set out their plan to improve the health of all women and girls. But the steps on how they set out to tackle the disparity in maternity care is yet to be published, with a rough deadline of Spring  given.

And £ self-isolation support payments, routine contact tracing and the legal obligation to tell your employeryou’re self-isolating will all disappear.More changes are coming down the track on March , including the removal of Day One Statutory Sick Pay, followed by the end of free lateral flow tests on April .While Boris Johnson claims he needs to tighten the purse strings on taxpayer cash, it’s prompted fury from unions and charities, who say low-wage workers and vulnerable people could be thrown to the wolves. Visitors to care homes wonapost get free tests.  But for all the noise, there’s plenty more detail in the small print of the -page ‘Living with Covid’ plan that you may have missed. Good, bad, or just interesting, here are  tricky details you may want to know ahead of the rule changes tomorrow.You’re still being asked to isolateThe legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test is being scrapped from midnight tonight in England. So is the guidance to test for seven daysa close contact gets the virus.But you’re still beingaskedto isolateyou test positive for the virus - and you’ll even be given guidance fora close contact tests positive.According to the Covid plan, “guidance will set out the precautions that those who live in the same household as someone who has Covid, or who have stayed overnight in the same household, are advised to take to reduce risk to other people. “Other contacts of people with Covid will be advised to take extra care in following general guidance for the public on safer behaviours.” Boris Johnson suggested Brits should show “restraint and responsibility”, and break the habit of going back to work and going into work when weaposre not well”. Covid advice will end - but only in nameFrom April , there will no longer be separate Covid advice on the government website - instead there’ll be general public health advice that includes Covid risks. But this advice will continue to note things we’ve learned through the pandemic, like wearing a face covering in crowded spaces, “trying to stay at home”you’re sick, “taking a testyou have Covid symptoms” despite this costing money, and “staying at home”you test positive. Of particular interest is the need for ventilation, with the Chief Scientic Advisor ordering a review on how buildings can be designed to be more infection-resistant. The report by the Royal Academy of Engineering will be published in May. There will also be “a ventilation audit of the central government estate”.Covid Day One sick pay and isolation payments will endFrom midnight tonight, the £ Test and Trace Support Payment for poor workers isolating due to Covid will end. And from March , people who fall ill with Covid will no longer be eligible for immediate aposDay Oneapos sick pay or Employment and Support Allowance. It’llto Day Four and Day Eight respectively, and people will no longer be eligible for ESAisolating due to Covid. Itaposs despite widespread calls for the Government to boost £.-a-week SSP so those struggling financially are not tempted to go back to work. Quizzed by the Mirror at a No press conference, Boris Johnson admitted: “Many people are entitled to other forms of payment. I know that won’t be everybody, and I understand that. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The failure to provide decent sick pay to all – from the first day of illness - is reckless and self-defeating. Dan Shears of the GMB union said it “guarantees workers will attend the workplace with Covid. Restoring the three day limit is an act of national self-sabotage.Care homes are set to lose their free PPECare homes will continue to be given free personal protective equipmentthrough a new central ‘portal’ - for now - after % in a consultation said it should stay.But the plan makes clear it will end, either in March  of “until the UK IPC guidance on PPE usage for COVID- is amended or superseded,” whichever is earlier.This appears to be a tighter test than in January, when the government said free PPE would end earlythe guidance is “withdrawn or signicantly amended”. Prof Martin Green, Chief Executive of Care England, told the Mirror: “Care England is calling for the government to ensure that every bit of policy is supported by appropriate resources.”Care home visitors won’t get free testsThe plan will scrap free Covid tests for people visiting their elderly loved ones in care homes. Downing Street said the end to free testing from April  will include people visiting care homes. That is despite some free testing continuing for people with symptoms who are over , or work in health or social care . Askedthere would be free tests for visitors to care homes, Boris Johnson’s official spokesman replied: “No, this is targeted at the most vulnerable and frontline staff.” Advinia Health Care founder Dr Sanjeev Kanoria said: It is entirely unfair to ask people to pay for tests to see their loved ones, or to expect financially stressed care homes to pay. “We have residents at our homes who are visited daily by friends and family and testing is a vital tool to keeping them and our staff safe. “Getting rid of free testing is going to not only put vulnerable older people at risk, but it will also reduce the number of visits they receive, which are critical for their wellbeing.” We still don’t know who’ll get free testsTaxpayer-funded lateral flow tests will be scrapped for almost everyone on April , and people will have to pay. Boots plans to charge £ for each box of five. Boris Johnson claimed: “Vulnerable people will continue to have access to free tests.” But who, exactly, counts as vulnerable  We already know people visiting care homes won’t get them, and the government hasn’t yet confirmed exactly who they’ll go to.It’s thought the over-s, the immunosuppressed, and patients on NHS wards will be eligible for some free tests, but exact lists are still being drawn up.A No spokesman said: “There will be free symptomatic tests available for social care and healthcare staff. On the position on asymptomatic testing, it will be set out by the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England in due course”.The medicine delivery service will endA “medicine delivery service” that was set up for people isolating due to Covid will no longer be available from midnight tonight. It was for people who were self-isolating to get prescription medication, by calling their local pharmacy or dispensing doctor. It was already a low-key service, described by the government as a “last resort” with patients told to rely on friends, family and volunteersthey possibly could. … Despite a greater risk to some peopleThe plan admits the risk of death from the virus is higheryou have conditions like Down’s syndrome, solid organ transplantation, Dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and neurological conditions. “Those living in more deprived areas and from certain ethnic minority groups were also at higher risk of COVID- mortality,” the plan adds. Yet while the most vulnerable are being offered an extra vaccine dose this Spring, the plan says: “The majority of people previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable are now advised to follow the same general guidance as everyone .” Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said on Monday: “This virus feeds off inequality and it drives inequality, and that needs to be borne in mind at all times through this.” Askedhe was satisfied the plan would keep immunosuppressed safe enough, Sir Patrick Vallance told the Mirror: “I’d like the prevalence to be lower, the rates of infections to be lower.… And the threat of a more powerful iantGovernment advisors have warned it is a “realistic possibility” that a new iant will evade vaccines or be more severe. The NERVTAG group even suggested a future iant could be as deadly as MERSwith a % fatality rate.“The loss of virulence as viruses evolve is a common misconception,” the experts said - suggesting milder Omicron was good luck.Sir Patrick Vallance said the UK would need to be able to “respond quickly” in weeks to rush controls back into being. “The resilience and the ability to ramp up is absolutely crucial,” the Chief Scientic Advisor said on Monday. “That doesn’t mean ramp up over months -something goes wrong, you need to be able to ramp up very quickly. Just remember how quickly Omicron took off - that tells us you’ve got a couple of weeks to get things back in action.” But the plan for living with Covid promises no such timescale. It simply says: “The Government will retain core infrastructure and capabilities in England to scale up testing in the case of a new dangerous iant.” … And the NHS is still under pressure No has claimed Covid is no longer putting stress on the NHS “in any way” - but Sir Chris Whitty has warned some hospitals are still under “signicant pressure”.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said on Monday: “There is still a relatively large amount of Covid circulating in the population, but because of the therapeutics and vaccinations and the other defences we’ve built, we’ve seen that it is not in any way placing stress on our NHS - in fact ICU numbers continue to fall, ditto hospitalisations, admissions and deaths, and that is to be welcomed.” Yet hours later, Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty told Monday night’s press conference: “It is certainly the case that there are hospitals in the UK which are still under signicant pressure as a result of Omicron, and I think we should be really clear about that.” He added the “big dference” is the trajectory is “steadily down”, and the number ending up in intensive care is “a very very much smaller proportion” as a result of vaccination and Omicron being milder. Surveillance is being stripped backOfficials said the government will maintain strong domestic surveillance, including the ONS Covid infection survey to spot new iants, and the Siren and Vivaldi studies. But the Mirror understands staff on the ONS infection survey are still awaiting news on their future - and there’s no guarantee it will happen at the same scale it does now. Boris Johnson boasted on Monday: “We want to have the keenest pair of eyes in the crowaposs nest to watch for the iceberg in the form of a new iant. And his Chief Scientic Advisor said: “That detection system is going to be vital”. But the living with Covid plan says only there will be “scaled-down, critical surveillance capabilities”.The hotel quarantine system is being shut down for goodThe UK’s Covid travel ‘red list’ was wiped clean in December after ministers realised it was pointless trying to keep Omicron out. But the ability to force people into £,-a-night hotel quarantine was kept in place - until now. The living with Covid plan reveals it will be permanently axed next month, and travellers will instead be told to isolate at homethere is a new iant. The plan says: “The infrastructure for hotel quarantine will be fully stood down from the end of March. “The Government is developing options to increase compliance with home isolation in its place should quarantine measures need to be reintroduced.”You won’t be able to view the NHS Covid passThe government stopped venues having to ask punters for a Covid pass in January. But pubs and clubs could still request onethey wanted - until now. The plan reveals the NHS Covid Pass will only remain available within the NHS app “for a limited period”, to support its use in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The app will, however, “continue to allow iniduals access to their vaccination status for international travel, as well as their recovery status for travel to those overseas destinations that recognise it.” Read MoreRead More"},{"url":null,"title":"meet russian linked tycoons who","story":"Meet the Russian-linked tycoons who gave Tory Party £million in donationsAmong Russia-linked figures filling Tory coffers is banker Lubov Chernukhin, married to Putin’s former deputy finance minister.

Boris Johnson announced sanctions against three billionaire oligarchs and five banks in retaliation for Kremlin forces launching action in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Prime Minister told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them. “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do.“We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.” Critics blasted the move after it emerged the oligarch trio have been on a US sanctions list since  - meaning it is unlikely many UK businesses have dealings with them. Mr Johnson insisted the Government would “be bringing forward further measures to hit Russian iniduals and Russian companies of strategic importance to Russia, stopping Russian companies from raising money on London markets and stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”. Keir Starmer said: “We have failed to stop the flow of illicit Russian finance into Britain.” Calling for the invasion to be “a turning point”, the Labour leader added: “We need an end to oligarch impunity, we need to draw a line under Companies House providing easy cover for shell companies, we need to ensure that our anti-money-laundering laws are enforced.” Former Treasury Minister Dame Angela Eagle questioned whether the sanctions would “close down the so-called London laundromat which is laundering dirty Russian money straight through the City”. MPs have become increasingly frustrated at the failure to crackdown Russia on cash swirling around the capital. Mega-rich, Kremlin-linked tycoons have bought multi-million-pound mansions in London and country estates in Surrey, sending their children to elite boarding schools. Ministers have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye or even encouraging them because of the funds they pump into the UK economy.  MPs on Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee published a damning report in July  accusing successive governments of paving the way for Russian funds to infiltrate Britain. “It would appear that the UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money,” the -page study said. “The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions –any – were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth.” Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tonight said Britain had become a “centre for illicit finance that reality discredits us in the eyes of the world”.  She demanded “much stronger action against illicit finance in the City of London, and the way in which - not just Russian money and illegal money, including money from organised crime in other countries - it’s possible to launder that money in the UK because there just aren’t strong enough checks in place”. Former Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, fumed: “We have to close the dirty Russian money down.” Exeter University academic Tena Prelec, part of a research team investigating international kleptocracy, said: “Our research shows elite iniduals from post-Soviet states are laundering their wealth and reputations in the UK, knowingly and willingly supported by a network of British professionals.  “The UK remains a safe haven for dirty money, a great deal of which comes from Russia and Eurasia. “Failure to tackle this thriving billion-dollar industry is damaging for the UK’s rule of law and to the UK’s professed role as an opponent of international corruption.” Campaigner Bill Browder, the head of Global Magnitsky Justice campaign, branded the Government’s sanctions “pretty tepid”. He added: “We should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money.”  He said: “We don’t have a beef with the Russian people, we have a beef with Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs who support him and the oligarchs who look after his money. “We don’t have to punish the entire Russian population at this stage of the game - we should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money. “Putin is one of the richest men in the world, he’s stolen an enormous amount of money over the last  years, and he doesn’t hold that money in his own name, he has other people holding it for him - his oligarch trustees. “It’s pretty straightforward,we were to sanction the  oligarch trustees who hold Putin’s money and their family members in the UK, he wouldn’t invade Ukraine.“We know exactly who they are, Boris Johnson knows who they are, the Foreign Office knows who they are, the Home Office knows who they are, I know who they are. “It’s all just a question of political will - does the Government want to actually stop a war  Or do they just want to seem to be reacting to this ” Royal United Services Institute think-tank financial and security expert Tom Keatinge said of the UK sanctions: Weaposve taken a peashooter to a gunfight. “It doesnapost make any sense to me at all, the whole point of the sanctions has been to deter Putin andat the first chance you get to use these sanctions you only tickle his feet, whataposs the point  “If we ever had the upper hand, weaposve lost it today. Meanwhile, calls mounted for Russia to be stripped of the UEFA Champions League final.St Petersburg is due to host the European club game’s showpiece event in May. But Mr Johnson told MPs it was “inconceivable” Russia could now stage major sporting fixtures. There was “no chance” of holding football tournaments in a Russia that “invades sovereign countries”, he told MPs.

This included buying ­influence by donating to political parties and charitable groups. Not only has the Prime Minister failed to act on any of the committee’s recommendations, since it published its report, the Conservatives have continued to accept donations from Russians with ties to the Kremlin. Mr Johnson today said that Britain was leading the world in taking action against Russia. As so often with this PM his boastful claim crumbled under the lightest of scrutiny. The sanctions imposed are far weaker than those taken by the EU and the US. If this Government were serious about confronting Russian aggression then the Tories would hand back any tainted donations. By refusing to do so they are putting their own interests ahead of those of the country. They are also making it harder to condemn Russia for trampling over democratic rights when murky money pollutes our democracy.  Back our NHS For two years health workers have worked tirelessly to help the country through the pandemic. Hundreds of their colleagues lost their lives to the virus. This was why we lined our streets week after week to clap for the carers. The only people not to show any gratitude are ministers sitting round the Cabinet table. They are proposing to give NHS staff a % pay rise – half the current rate of inflation. With staff leaving because of exhaustion, stress and low pay we should be doing ­everything we can to encourage them to stay. Kids squeezed Children are getting less pocket money because of the financial squeeze. The bank of mum and dad is only dealing in “small” change.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

Its Children and Young People Board chairwoman Anntoinette Bramble said: “Councils and youth sector partners have already been waiting more than two years for the fund to get off the ground only to find out that the original funding commitment is being reduced. “We are also unconvinced that improving facilities should take greater priority over investing in the staff and youth work programmes, which can be transformative to a young person’s le. “It is important that the Government sticks to its original funding commitment for this vital fund and allows councils to invest in hiring hundreds of full-time youth workers.” According to the LGA, the average, basic full-time annual salary for youth and community support workers employed by councils in   was £,.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

We donapost see our dogs as aposdogsapos. They are part of our family and we spend almost every minute of every day with them, they even sleep in our beds with us, Brookie Goodlin, in Oregon, USA, told The Mirror. We take them everywhere. Theyaposve been on aeroplanes, to horse shows, the mall, the beach - where we go, they go! to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Brookie and Brayden started uploading videos of their family le on TikTok during lockdown, to create something they could remember. It became a video diary, and they always made sure it was just as fun and enjoyable for the dogs. Brookie says a typical day in the le in the Goodlin household consists of feeding and exercising the pooches - and lots of it. Feeding takes a good - minutes twice a day. They each get their walk or run time and we have training classes in the evenings, she said. The average dog gets through approximately lbs of food a month - but with eight hungry mouths to feed, the Goodlin family get through lbs of raw meat and four bags of kibble too. While eight wagging tails and  paws might seem a lot for a normal household, the Goodlin family are used to it - and say they wouldnapost have it any other way. We always grew up with a lot of dogs so it’s normal for us, Brookie said. Our parents are the biggest dog lovers ever and animal people in general. The pets formed a pack from a young age and everyone gets on well. We do lots of bonding exercises together, whether it’s creating a TikTok, going for a hike together, a snuggle session on the sofa or a group play day, Brookie said. On Saturdays, the Goodlin family love to explore a new location, whether that be a mountain, beach, lake or river.We also take them horse camping with us in the summers and they love long trail rides and campfires, Brookie said. They enjoy travelling in general to see new places and smell new smells!She says the best thing about living with eight large dogs is living with eight of your best friends. They are our family members so we try to take them everywhere with us, including our vacations, Brookie said. We want them to live the most fulfilled le ever and explore the world as much as they can. They all get up to mischief on a daily basis - and the family have had to build a high fence to stop Maleficent and Tfany spending too much time with the neighbours.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Matthew Whittaker was sorting the weekly shop when he pulled out the x-rated veg from his p bag from his local Tesco in Penzance. Whilst he admitted to being stunned by the find, his we Amy, , had a laughing fit in their kitchen at the sight of the phallic parsnip. Dad-of-two Matthew, , told Liverpool Echo: “We had a good laugh about it, itaposs the second time Iaposve found a rude vegetable from the same Tesco. How lucky am I  I thought oh no, not again - why do these rude vegetables keep finding me   Two years ago, the couple, of St Just in Penwith, Cornwall, found a carrot with a rude-looking appendage from a bag of shopping theyaposd had delivered from the same store. Delivery driver Matthew said Amy, a support worker, called him into the kitchen to show him the hilarious X-rated find. The couple usually buy wonky carrots, but their local store did not have any in when they ordered - and Matthew quipped they sent winky ones instead. Matthew, originally from Bradford added: I guess itaposs just luck that I find the funny ones. “I just need a rude swede now and Iaposll have a full set.  Matthew sliced the parsnip and the couple ate it on a roast dinner.Earlier a mum shared how she has slashed the cost of her food bill as thecost of living crisisis continuing to squeeze hard-working families across the UK.One way to save cash is to batch cook so meals are ready for later in the week or month. Fay Churchward, , a mum-of-two from Plymouth, says batch cooking saves her around £ a week - and it also means she has more time in the evenings.  She toldLatestDeals: “I started batch cooking when the kids left home. I found I couldn’t stop making meals for four people, so it made sense to freeze a couple of portions to use another day.It also means I have more time to do the things I enjoy. If I spend a couple of hours on a weekend doing some batch cooking, I have more time in the week for what I want to do. “I am also less likely to grab a takeaway instead. It has the added bonus of less washing usually too. “I am all about working smarter, not harder.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TescoSave moneyFunny ha ha viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What do you think the babyaposs name will be  Have your say in the comment section  “Ophelia is obsessed with her little brother already --.” The family’s account replied: “So excited to meet him, just don’t keep us all waiting too long, little man.” Her post fuelled speculation over his name with many fans suggesting it could start with the same letter as his elder sister. One fan said: Trying to think of boy names beginning with O as I remember you saying you wanted all your children to have the same initials.  Referring to a moment when Millie spoke to her mum Sue about the potential of naming all her children with the same initial of her first born Ophelia. In response, Mille said: Awwww aha no his name doesn’t begin with O, although I do remember saying that. But this wasnapost the end of it for other fans who continued to throw in name suggestions for boys beginning with an O.  Another fan said: Oliver, Oscar, Owen, Otis, Oakley, Orlando thataposs all I could think of. To which Millie confirmed: His name doesn’t begin with an O. While baby number two remains hidden away from the spotlight, Millieaposs other posts and snaps lead to the idea that she could be heavily overdue.

The family recently packed the pews of their local church, including all  of their children, to celebrate the christening of the two youngest members.Sue and Noel took part in the final christening for their two youngest daughters Heidi and Bonnie in the most recent episodeofChannel  series‘ Kids  Counting’, which documents the family’s often-hectic le.

The woman managed to make her escape and ran from the city centre and rang the emergency services who found her at Hyde Park corner. However, it was not until six and a half years later that Osayanda would answer for his crimes, and only after he attacked another woman in her home. In September last year, Osayande - who was working as a delivery driver for Hermes at the time - delivered a parcel to the womanaposs house and told her he would knock for a coffee later. As he went to the womanaposs home, they chatted before he pounced and subjected her to a sickening sexual assault.  The woman reported the assault to police and Osayande was arrested the same day. It was only then when his DNA was linked to the rape in Leeds city centre, that he would face justice for his first attack. The initial victim told Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday that she had suffered since the sickening attack, self-harmed and even attempted to take her own le. She said the comments he made to her after he raped her were mentally and physically harrowing.  The second woman said she struggles to trust men and added: I can no longer sleep well and have nightmares about the attack, and him [Osayande] coming for me - even killing me. Since the attack I have not been able to date anyone. I have lost my trust in people. Even though he is in prison as a result of the attack I still find myself looking over my shoulder. As he was sentenced, Osayande was described by the Recorder of Leeds, Judge Guy Kearl QC as a danger to women. The judge said: You are a danger to women, whether known to you or strangers in situations where you can get them alone and then force yourself on them.  This danger has continued for at least six years. You pose a high risk of causing serious harm to female members of the public. Osayande was handed a le sentence with a minimum term of  years for the offence of rape. He was jailed for  years for the charge of assault by penetration, which will run concurrently to the first sentence. Osayande will serve two-thirds of his sentence before he is eligible to go before the Parole Board who will decide whether he is safe to be released. He will be on licence for the remainder of his le and has been made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order.

The paedophile - recalled to prison for a second time in  after being found with , sick child sex abuse images - could be referred to the parole board within weeks.Monster Venablesapos plea could be put to the Board as early as April after completing his minimum sentence. James Bulgeraposs murderer has a strong chance of success, sources say, because of his good behaviour inside. The -year-old is expected to make the brazen bid for release despite re-offending, having been found with a stash of horrying child abuse images on his laptop in .  In October , Venables was denied parole after experts found he still had an attraction to sexual violence. The forensic reports gather views of prison officers, experts, psychiatrists and Venables himself.It could be presented in April and an insider told The Sun : Venables spent three years in prison after his first recall before being freed - this time around heaposs already done four years.If heaposs complied with prison treatment programmes and continued to make progress, then he stands a strong chance of release.Andthe Parole Board rules heaposs safe to go free, then only the Justice Secretary can prevent it. Venables is entitled to a hearing every two years so is due to be referred to the Board in the coming months. It is set to cost the taxpayer even more with £. million already estimated to have been spent trying to rehabilitate Venables. He was sent down in  for hoarding over a thousand vile pictures of children. The images included category A photos, the most serious type, and he also admitted having a “paedophile manual”. He has served over four years for surfing the dark web for images of boys James’ age being abused.  Sentencing him in , Mr Justice Edis said: “The children depicted were often very young and vulnerable, there is discernible pain and distress suffered.” He called Venables “manipulative and dishonest”. During his hearing, the court heard that upon his arrest he told cops in the police car: This is my own fault. I have let people down again. I have had urges, inquisitive. It won’t be a slap on the wrist for me.”The Board face having to decideit should hold a full hearing - with evidence from witnesses - or make a judgement on documents and expert opinion. It is claimed a full, oral hearing is a racing certainty because of the high-profile of the warped killer. In June , it was reported Venables was being assessed for a permanent move abroad. It was suggested authorities believed paying for him to be shted to a country like Canada, Australia or New Zealand would be cheaper than funding more failed new starts in the UK. Venables and Robert Thompson were ten when they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James in Merseyside in . Mum Denise Fergus says Venables has shown “no remorse”.

The fan-favourite has made itself a reputation for the number one dairy product to slather on your baked potato or to spread, generously, over your morning toast. The brand has a global appeal too, having won the best butter in the world title at the  World Championship Cheese Contest.With its popularity, itaposs no surprise that Lurpak is on the pricier side of butter - which budget supermarkets have addressed by offering similar high-quality spreads while keeping the price down.But, is there a cheaper alternative to the popular - but costly - Lurpak butter Well, thataposs what Alice Suffield from Wales Online set out to find out after she picked up a few supermarket branded butters and tested them against the mighty Lurpak. Lurpak Setting the standards for the test, Alice began with Lurpak which she says has been a consistent staple in my fridge. Of course, the Lurpak butter continued to be the butter that we all know and love when she popped it on to her toast. She said: Easy to spread, melted to perfection on the warm toast, and tasted as it has for years, satisfyingly savoury, tasting just as butter should. The price did not taste as good however, as at £. it is the most expensive of our spreads, but it is to be expected from a household brand. Alice does admit that the quality and the price do match each other, but it was worth finding outmaybe she could switch to a cheaper supermarket version.Nordpak - Aldi Up first was the brand that has become pretty popular for providing popular supermarket dupes that are still big on quality, but low on price. In terms of the packaging, Alice did notice that Aldiaposs Norpak is eerily similar to itaposs branded competitor. As for the overall taste, it was found that the supermarketaposs version didnapost taste as strong as Lurpak, but that was not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, Alice found that the spread didnapost overpower the toast, unlike Lurpak, which is something that she never noticed before. She did find that it was arguably the hardest to spread out of all the butters, but that was rectied once she left it to melt on the toast for a little while. She added: The price was much more reasonable, costing £. for a g tub. When compared to the brand, it seems a sensible swap to make, with a saving of over £..Danpak - Lidl Next up on the list was the popular budget supermarket Lidl with their own Danpak which cost just £. - the cheapest of the bunch. After giving a whirl, Alice found that Lidl missed the mark with this one, as the taste was unremarkable because it didnapost really stand out compared to the others. Alice said: Sadly for me, the taste was unremarkable, you could tell it was butter, but it didnapost have the same stand-out savoury flavour that the two previous butters did. Whilst it did spread and melt with ease, I would rather pay the extra p for Aldiaposs Nordpak.Spreadable - Morrisons Last on the list was Morrisons with their very own version of Lurpak, which was, once again, eerily similar to the original. After trying this one out, Alice did find that Morrisons Spreadable was rather dferent to their other options she had tasted at this point, due to being a bit sweeter. She said: Of the three, this one was the sweetest. The rest specied that they were slightly salted, so that explains why it tasted as sweet as it did in comparison. It still tasted like butter however, and it spread and melted like a dream. At £. for g, it is the second most expensive, but still over £ cheaper than Lurpak.The verdictFrom Aliceaposs responses, it looks like Aldiaposs Nordpak took the crown as being a worthy substitute for her usual go-to Lurpak in the weekly shop. The budget supermarketaposs version was found to be a winner on quality and price, as well as providing a rather decent saving off £.. Which is good news for families looking to keep their costs low while they get in their household essentials. The reporter said that, after the test, Nordpak would be going into her basket from now on, while Morrisons Spreadable and Lidlaposs Danpak would be left on their shelves.

Dale Saint Cullen, , has spent the last five years chase a certain look, and says social media brainwashed him into chasing this  reality. He is now telling his story to raise awareness of the impact of social media has on peopleaposs self-esteem. He said: On social media, I never noticed at the time, but I was looking at these people who looked perfect and I fell into this vicious cycle of chasing what was not the reality, it was completely .I was flying out to Poland and Turkey and showing surgeons filtered pictures on Instagram of how I wanted to look.It took me a while to realise thataposs not what they actually look like in real le.  Dale said he has realised that he will never achieve the look that he wanted, and he now advocates for people to love themselves inside and out. He is hoping to warn others to not fall into the same trap.He said: Iaposm -years-old now and it seems like people on social media are getting younger and younger and I worry about the affect it has on them. When you see all these reality TV stars ad influencers and they look perfect it can be really damaging to young people. Dale said that when celebrities encourage surgery or tell people to buy these products to get the perfect Hollywood smile, it has a profound effect on their self-esteem. He adds: I think I was trying to fit in with society. I was fine during school. It wasnapost until social media came about, thataposs when I first started thinking about getting work done.  Dale initially only wanted to get a nose job, but has described surgery as a slippery slope. Social media led him to want surgery on his chin, have better teeth, bigger lips, and a sharper jaw. He said: Its like thereaposs always a new trend and I just couldnapost keep up. Iaposm all for following the trend but not when it means you have to change your entire face. Dale doesnapost regret the work heaposs had done, only the reasons behind it. He will also be doing another surgery in June.  He is encouraging people to make sure theyaposre getting surgery for the right reasons -thataposs what they want to do. He said: I spent so much time, money, and energy on chasing that perfect look, itaposs crazy. I would just say to people to make sure you do your research first and make sure youaposre doing it for the right reasons. Iaposm seeing a therapist to try and make sure I work on myself. The work I had done in the past, it wasnapost for me, I did it under the pressures of social media. Iaposm in a much better place now and I make sure everything I do is for me. Dale has also warned that getting cosmetic surgery can make you feel worse rather than helping with any issue you think you may have. I really want to show other young people that chasing a look like that isnapost possible and it can leave you feeling worse than you did beforehand, he explained. He adds that there are some days where he wakes up and feels more self-conscious now than he did before the surgery.

Talisa Windsor is today starting a prison sentence after dousing the front of the property with petrol before trying to set it ablaze. The -year-old has been jailed after she was caught pouring nearly four litres of fuel she had stolen from a nearby Texaco on the front of the house in Hove, East Sussex.Prosecutors said it was a miracle the flammable cocktail didnapost ignite with possibly devastating consequences as she begins a six-year sentence.CCTV footage released by Sussex Police shows her stealing the petrol before she later lobs the bomb filled with fuel and tissue paper at the door. The shocking clip begins with Windsor filling up a jerry can with petrol at the pump before she makes off without paying. It then switches to the home where the woman - wearing a grey tracksuit - can be seen throwing the bomb at the property before scurrying off.Chichester Crown Court heard that she tried to set it on fire by filling a broken bottle with more petrol. During the hearing, a judge heard that during the incident, which took place on May  last year, she threw a bottle through a front window of the house in Moyne Close, Hove, East Sussex. A spokesman for Sussex Police said: Police were called after members of the public reported smelling petrol and Windsor was witnessed filling the bottle with petrol nearby. She was swtly arrested while officers went to the Moyne Close address to ensure the safety of the occupants, who had escaped. Windsor was also caught on CCTV stealing the petrol and carrying out the attack.  It was later revealed that Windsor had sent a number of threatening messages to the occupants, who were known to her, in the days leading up to the incident - including several death threats. Windsor, of Amberley Drive, Hove, was convicted of attempted arson reckless as to whether it endangered le. A judge handed her a six-year jail sentence, with a further three years on an extended licence. Investigating officer Detective Constable Rose Horan says she could have caused death by her actions.  DC Horan said: This was an extremely disturbing incident which threatened the lives of a family with two young children, who were inside the house when Talisa Windsor attempted to set it alight. CCTV showed that the cigarette lighter did ignite, so it was extremely lucky that the .L of petrol around the front door did not go up in flames. Had that happened, we could have been looking at a tragic outcome. Nonetheless, Judge Stuart Trimmer found Windsor met the criteria for a dangerous offender and passed an extended sentence. I would like to thank the victims, witnesses and everybody who supported the investigation for their help in bringing a dangerous inidual to justice.

Kiran Nasreen was diagnosed with Hyperemesis Gravidarum, which can leave women bedridden and vomiting, and told her boss, Dr Akbar Ali Malik, she was unable to work. But an employment tribunal heard her texts and calls were ignored so her husband went into the office on her behalf to explain. The  was told Dr Malik was hostile and refused to take her sick notes or medical evidence because she was no longer needed after working at the firm for three years. The Duchess of Cambridge suffered from the condition with all three of her pregnancies and ended up in hospital while carrying her firstborn, Prince George.It affects up to % of women in the UK and is one of the most common reasons for hospitalisation during pregnancy, according to the NHS.Mrs Nasreen won her discrimination claim after a  ruled that bosses believed her dficult pregnancy was inconvenient to the firm. She has been awarded £, in compensation.  Mrs Nasreen began working for Malik Law Chambers, a London-based immigration solicitors firm, in December  as a receptionist where Dr Malik was her line manager and the pair had a good working relationship. In December , she became pregnant. She told Dr Malik about her pregnancy and that she was already having some sickness and might encounter further dficulties so may need time off, the  heard. After she went off work on January , she sent texts to Dr Malik saying she was very unwell and apologised for being unable to come in. But the  heard he did not answer these, nor her calls. Mrs Nasreenaposs husband then went into the office to give Dr Malik copies of sick notes and medical evidence as in February, while seven weeks pregnant, she was diagnosed with Hyperemesis Gravidarum. Despite her husband reiterating that her illness was pregnancy-related, Dr Malik sacked her, the tribunal heard.Mrs Nasreen then sent her sick note and hospital letter again, hoping Dr Malik would reconsider his decision to fire her.But she later received her December payment along with her Christmas bonus and nothing further despite her having worked until January , the hearing was told. Mrs Nasreen has now successfully sued her bosses at an employment tribunal for pregnancy discrimination, unauthorised deduction from wages and unfair dismissal.

Since , it has been the leading source of information on HG and have helped hundreds of thousands of families across the globe. The  - headed by employment judge David Massarella - concluded that problems only arose when she became pregnant, with Malik Law Chambers taking none of the usual steps in relation to a pregnant employee. Judge Massarella said: We infer from all the evidence that [Dr Malikaposs] attitude to her changed when he realised she was having a dficult pregnancy, which was giving rise to a protracted period of sickness absence anda period of maternity leave. This was inconvenient to the firm and Dr Malik decided to dispense with her services in a summary fashion. The problems only arose after she became pregnant. Dr Malikaposs attitude to her and her husband became hostile and uncooperative.

AE nurse Jane Sudds had always wanted a pet pig and during the winter lockdown in , she realised that she was at the right stage in le to welcome one into her home.After years of research, the Blackpool local adopted Wilbur, who now lives with her in Blackpool and enjoys walks on the famous beach, Lancs Live reported. Jane, , said Wilbur has settled in quickly and loves his outdoor space as well as snuggling in the living room with her, Pomeranian dog Moo, aged , and cat Kitty, aged six. Jane said: He is a little monkey. “He’s really loving and always wants attention, he’s also a proper foodie, strawberries and melon are his favourites.  His favourite thing to do is to follow me around! I think he thinks he’s smaller than he is, but he’s actually quite a heavy lump, but it’s so lovely.” Jane approached micro pig breeder Kew Little Pigs, who told her she would have to do a pig keeping course, which would teach her all about how to look after Wilbur properly. When Wilbur arrived he had to stay at home for  days and Jane had to apply for a walking licence, outlining specic routes that she would use when she takes Wilbur for his walks. She said: “There is quite a lot to it, and you have to be sure you have some outside space because many pigs like to be outside for the majority of the time. “Wilbur just wants to be wherever I am, but he also has his ball pit, mud pit and sandpit in his outside pen.  “When I go to work he enjoys it out there, and Kitty goes outside too so I think she pays him a few visits in the day. “He really likes to go to the beach, though he didn’t like going in the sea at first. He just trots up and down and everyone wants to come and pet him and cuddle him. A half-hour walk will always take double the time because of all the people who want to stop and say hello.” When preparing to adopt Wilbur, Jane took her new responsibilities very seriously, and at the same time her friend Hannah, who lives nearby, adopted Wilbur’s brother Boris. This means that when either of them wants to go on holiday the other can care for the pigs, after informing the appropriate authorities that their pets will be moved, as they are classed as livestock. Speaking about the process of adopting Wilbur, Jane said Kew had been “brilliant”. She said: I had read horror stories about some places that sell standard piglets as micro pigs and lie about their ages, so I’m so glad I did my research and found Kew. Adopting Wilbur has been wonderful, he’s like a dog, but more too!” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Animals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Little Elsie, who is between  and -months-old, was rescued from abusers in Romania and flown over to the UK for a second chance at le. The mixed breed is currently at Oakwood Dog Rescue in Hull - but is in desperate need of a loving home.A spokesperson said:Dogs like Elsie have been under socialised with people.The only interactions they will have had with people prior to arriving at the rescue centre will have been negative – consisting of abuse, beatings, dragged on a catchpole and scruffing,not more.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  The treatment of puppies is not any dferent and can really affect their view of people.Since arriving as an emaciated and terried puppy, Elise has been slowly learning how to trust humans.Elsie is still very timid we have been hand-off with her so that she doesn’t have to fear that we are going to hurt her or force her to do anything she is not comfortable with, the spokesperson added. She has made progress since this time she will come over for treats and investigate people, but she is not ready for touches or strokes. Elsie is a project dog who will need a good amount of time to settle into her home - and will need an owner who is willing to let her take as long as she needs to get there. The spokesperson said: Dogs like Elsie usually do not progress past a certain point in rescue, and most progress will be seen once she has fully settled into the home environment.  We know this because we have rehomed lots of dogs that were just as timid as Elsie that have gone on to really bond with their owners, learn to walk on the lead and live fantastic lives. Elsie is brilliant with other dogs and gains confidence from them. She displays submissive body language and just wants to be their friend. She needs a confident dog, or dogs in the home to help her to progress and learn from them, the spokesperson adds. She will be a dog that you don’t need to do much with for a good while, your current pooches will be the best teachers for Elsie, and she will begin to mimic their behaviours. As Elsie is very shy, she will need to live in an adult-only home or a home with child over aged . She has not been tested with cats. The spokesperson said: We understand that dogs like Elsie are not for everyone, we have had applicants admit that they have not experienced dogs as timid as ours before despite having years of dog experience. Yet, we have had many first-time dog owners adopt and succeed with very timid dogs – all it takes is patience and taking on board advice from staff. Many rescues would overlook dogs like Elsie, but we believe that she has lots of potential in a home and deserves a chance at happiness. Adopting Elsie will be an incredibly rewarding journey, seeing her enter the home as a timid dog and working with her to become a loving, trusting and valued member of the family is one of the best journeys you could ever embark on.If youaposre interested in rehoming Elsie, or any other dogs at Oakwood Dog Rescue, contact their team via adoptions@oakwooddogrescue.Do you have a dog story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

But luckily the Queen was there to teach her everything she knows, reports MyLondon.According to the  Amazon Prime documentary, Kate Middleton: Working Class to Windsor, Kate took private lessons on “how to be a royal we” before the big day - and who better to learn how to be a royal from than the head of the family herself. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .The meetings between the two reportedly happened ahead of Kateaposs wedding. During this time, the Queen also helped Kate decide what her official royal title could be, eventually settling on Catherine, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge. From the beginning, Kate Middleton had a great deal of support from the Royal Family which was really instructed by the Queen, Journalist Ashley Pearson explained in the documentary.This was to make sure she knew as much as she could possibly know and what to do in every situation – bearing in mind, of course, that she didn’t grow up in this world. As for what Kateaposs secret aposPrincess lessonsapos involved, Ashley revealed the one thing that she really needed to work on was how to apospreserve her modesty.apos Ashley continued: There were things like learning how to get out of a carriage without exposing your modesty and learning how to bend down to get flowers from a young girl without exposing your modesty.Things that you would never think you’d have to learn but, of course, a woman in her position would certainly need to know. There were all kinds of small details and little bits of etiquette – how to sit, who to curtsy to, who not to curtsy to, what fork to use and whatever  they felt she needed to know. She was actually given lessons on how to be a royal we. Kateaposs mother-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, also has some words of wisdom on how to aposhang on to a prince.apos But according to royal author Robert Lacey, she struggled to follow it. Camillaaposs essential tip for Kate was to make sure her le moulded to the way William leads his, in order to make the union last. In his royal biography, Battle of Brothers, Robert said: Camilla had confided to Kate the secret of hanging on to a busy prince: fit your timetable - well, basically your whole le - around his. However, despite Camillaaposs advice, Lacey claims that this wasnapost really possible for Kate as Williamaposs diary was un-fit-roundable.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

It wascaptioned: As Scotland team patron, The Princess Royal often supports the team from the stands.Her Royal Highness and Vice Admiral Sir Tim cheered Scotland on from home today as they played England for the Calcutta Cup,  years since their first match. Well played, Scotland. Scotland beat England - during the opening weekend of the annual tournament. The pair looked quite relaxed watching the game in her cosy living room, which was filled with family photographs, paintings, books and ious trinkets.  Pictures of Princess Zaraaposs  christening as well as photos of her son Peter Phillips as a youngster could be seen around the room, as could numerous books including two large copies of animals. On the walls were several landscape paintings in mismatched frames, all of which appeared to be of ious seaside towns. Two cabinets on the back wall were filled with little ornaments, like porcelain animal figurines, and more framed photos.Many royal fans offered their opinions on the room, as one person said: Thank you HRH but please declutter, that would play havoc with my OCD. Another said: I feel a little claustrophobic just looking at all the stuff in their living room.In a video congratulating those who were involved in the opening of the NHS Louisa Jordan Hospital in Glasgow, we got to see another room in the home.The cream-coloured room features metallic bronze furniture including a large mirror, a cabinet filled with animal ornaments, and four rectangular framed photos hanging on the walls. There are also three side tables behind her - one features a blue and white desk lamp with a large lampshade and three framed photos.  Another below the mirror holds more photo frames and a vase full of light pink roses, and the last directly behind Anne showcases two white photo frames including a photo of Zara and her husband Mike on their wedding day. Zara also lives on the Gatcombe Park estate with Mike along with their daughters Mia, six, and Lena, one. We got to see a small glimpse inside of their home when she appeared as a guest on Good Morning Britain via video call.  Zara sang the Queenaposs praises to Piers Morgan on the national address on coronavirus she delivered to the UK, and also thanked the NHS and key workers for their hard work.The video call meant viewers were able to see into her home, as the shot showed a cream room with traditional wooden beams and a staircase in the corner. It also showed a cream kettle and a coffee maker on the side, and a Dyson fan.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Parents at All Saints Catholic Primary School, in Bootle, Merseyside, received a letter on Monday after the storm battered Britain, bringing winds of up to mph.This was the third storm to hit the country within a week.In the letter, it explained that the school was ‘staggered’ due to the absences of “many children” The Liverpool Echo reported.One mum slammed the letter and school’s behaviour, calling it “disgusting”. For safety reasons I didn’t want him walking on his own, there were many people who I’m aware have kept their kids off too.  When I saw the email from the school I was crying to my sister about it because they were making me feel like a bad parent for putting my kid first. The letter read: Welcome back to a new half term to all who ed to school this morning. It was lovely to see our children excitedly reunite with their friends and with staff. Unfortunately, we have many children absent today, not because of Covid or other illnesses but apparently because of the wind! I have to say I find this staggering, not least because most live in very close proximity to school.  Given the amount of pre-school and school experiences that our children have already missed in the last two years, missing a whole dayaposs learning today is unacceptable. For staff, many of whom travelled considerable distances here this morning, eager to introduce new learning topics to their class, it is incredibly frustrating. The apostone deafapos letter went on to speak about how they were in awe when seeing photographs of children walking barefoot to school for miles or clambering over rubble past bombed out ruins in war-torn countries. It said: Iaposm always in awe when I see photographs of children and parents around the world who value education so dearly that they walk barefoot for miles or clamber over rubble, past bombed out ruins, in order to get to school.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  I wonder what they might make of our attendance rates in school today. The mum, who asked to remain anonymous, said: I’ve kept my son off school due to the winds as I work from am being a single mum he has to take himself to school. For safety reasons I didn’t want him walking on his own, there were many people who I’m aware have kept their kids off too. When I saw the email from the school I was crying to my sister about it because they were making me feel like a bad parent for putting my kid first. I was shocked at the last bit of the email, thereaposs no comparing kids here and people in really poor countries. It was awful.  All Saints Headteacher Angela Holleran said she regrets any upset caused to parents and explained it wasnapost our intention.She said: We are aware that we did experience windy conditions on Monday morning and that the Met Office had issued a yellow weather warning for our area, indicating possible low-level impact.In line with schools across Sefton, we were open as normal to all pupils. All risk assessments on the site had been completed well in advance of the children arriving. “All of our staff were in school ready for the start of the new half term, fully expecting pupils to arrive, given that the overwhelming majority live in very close proximity to the school.  For pupils who did attend, classes went ahead as normal and following a further risk assessment, children were able to play and learn outdoors. We regret any upset caused to the parent who felt the need to contact the Liverpool Echo. This was not our intention. “Pre and post -Covid, our focus was and remains, on the entitlement of every child to a full-time education. Governors and staff at All Saints are mindful of the well-established link between school attendance and a happy and successful le. The disruption to childrenaposs learning and development, as a result of the pandemic, is signicant and far- reaching in all year groups. In response, from September , we extended the school day at both ends to provide additional teaching time to all children. Comprehensive tutoring and pastoral programmes have also been implemented across the school to support children. We want all children to be in school every day to benefit from as much of this support as possible and we hope parents will work with us to ensure this is the case.

The couple set their sights on the local church when they heard it would be moving and after several years of waiting, they finally purchased it for , in December . They proceeded to spend five months turning it into a family home, painting the exterior completely black and building four bedrooms, three full bathrooms and three half-bathrooms. They also created two offices, a workout room, lobby, craft room, game room, two laundry rooms and two TV rooms.  Kristen said the best thing about living in a church was “absolutely everything”. She added: The slide is a huge one...the kids laugh every time they go down! We’ve never had a house where all seven of us can cook in the kitchen together but here we can and we love that so much. Matt said the pair had “always loved” historic restoration and reuse. “We love the cosy, Scandinavian feel of black,” he said.  In , the family wanted to move away from their property in Troy, Ohio, US, and closer to their children’s school in Pleasant Hill, so they wouldn’t have to cross as many busy roads to get there. Matt said: “We heard through the rumour mill that the church had land south of town and was looking to build a new facility. My wonderfully creative, yet slightly too creative we, Kristen came up with this idea that was crazy at the time, yet the idea grew legs.” Within just two weeks they approached the church with the idea of purchasing the building, and after a few weeks of discussions, their offer was sadly rejected as it wasnapost the right time.In their excitement, Matt and Kristen had already accepted an offer their family home, so moved into a ‘doer-upper’ they bought at auction. “We thought about it every day since we first walked through it,” said Kristen. Four years and two house flips later, Pleasant Hill Church of God reached out to the Grays once more and said they had begun construction on their new facility and were ready to sell. Matt said: “I think they really appreciated the idea and the fact that the building would now house a new purpose and would not be torn down to create a parking lot as previously proposed.  “In a way that only God himself could orchestrate, the timing and financial positioning of all of the above happened in a fully coordinated and perfectly timed way.” Using the money they had made through increasing the equity on their previous two homes, they closed on the church for , in November , and a month later it held its final service. Decorating started as soon as Matt and Kristen had got the green light from the village community. They gave it a new metal roof and upgraded the plumbing and electrics, before painting the exterior black. Matt said: “The black theme is complemented and softened with copper accents, gas flame lanterns, natural limestone and tactfully designed landscaping.”  They also wanted to involve their five children, between the ages of eight and , to design their bedrooms and other spaces like a craft room, game room, TV room and reading nooks. They also created a home-schooling area, as their two sons and three daughters are now taught by Kristen. The parents also added a huge master bedroom with a soaking bath, walk-in shower, office spaces, gym area and laundry facilities. As well as these modern features, Matt and Kristen were also able to keep a few of the original items from the church to use in their design. The pews now act as seating in the dining and home-schooling rooms, and the font used for baptisms has been repurposed as their kitchen sink.  Commercial contractor Matt said: To think of all the lives that were transformed in this steel tub gives you goosebumps. “Now it is living a bit less glamorous le as our kitchen sink, regardless we are excited that it could be salvaged and used. A church attendance board, which once displayed numbers in the hundreds, is now in the bell tower with a count of seven. They all lived inside the church while renovations took place, and for the first month, they didn’t have a working shower or bath. Dad Matt said: “We would have to schedule showers at area family and friends’ houses. “Meanwhile, you better have hit the restroom before going to bed, asyou woke up in the middle of the night needing to pee you would have to travel across a dark and spooky -year-old church to find the nearest restroom! After five months the conversion was complete, but the family still like the building to be used by the community for bible study and as a food bank. Matt said: “This small town has a huge heart full of amazing people, we simply try to hold up our end of that bargain and do things the right way. “We love having a place that is fun, safe and conveniently located. “We can spread out and have our separate spaces, yet are close to each other.

She was then rushed to hospital after the implants tore open her skin leaving her with oozing, open wounds and blood clots in her lungs and legs, with doctors worried she would go into septic shock.It was only the day after the surgery that the clinic admitted they had accidentally preformed the wrong surgery. She said:I trusted that I was only having my breasts done. From working in the medical field I know they would only mark where theyaposre performing procedures. I was so confused how there was a mix-up. They told me the whole team made a mistake - they werenapost maintaining surgical logs, they werenapost checking their patients.They had no idea what they were performing or who on. They did this without my consent, I had no idea this was going on Two weeks later, Tfany was admitted to hospital after the wounds beneath her breast became infected and blood clots were found in her lungs and legs. She was left fearing for her le as doctors worried that she would go into septic shock.I was terried, because I have three children, and I was scared I wasnapost going to be there for them,” Tfany said. I was absolutely furious at the fact the clinic was so careless. I was in the hospital for four days and then sought wound care for two months. I was probably on about five dferent antibiotics before the infections cleared up. Tfany has been struggling to get her le back to normal since the procedure, as she dealt with the financial fallout of being unable to work following the ordeal.  I managed to dispute the surgery charge with my bank and get the money back. The clinic is trying to fight it and claiming that this is what I asked for,” she said. She had just had another surgery to correct part of the problem the doctors caused, and said her ex-husband and her vet assistant partner Kris Harper were helping out where they could, with things like childcare. She was still recovering, Tfany said, from a second surgery to fix part of the problem caused, and had been asked to consider scar revision treatment for the marks left under her breasts. The clinic did not respond to a request for comment.

Farber, , was stopped as she tried to join her family in Mexico last April.She told officers she was not the person they were looking for and had never been to Texas, US, where the alleged crime they were investigating took place.The LAPD proceeded to arrest her in front of airport staff without confirming her identity or checking her driver’s licence, legal documents state. Despite her pleas, she was handcuffed to a chair at Los Angeles International Airport before being forced to spend  days behind bars.Have your say on this story in the comment section She described conditions as dangerous and terrying - and also says she felt defeated before her family finally proved she was at her auntaposs house on the day in question after finding a photo. A federal lawsuit alleges “LAPD held [Farber] in jail for the next  days until April , . She told FOX: I told them you have the wrong person - please check.

The filing reads: “Plaintf is a young woman with long, blonde hair, while the other woman is older with short brown hair. “Furthermore, the warrant was for a woman in the State of Texas and Plaintf has never been to the State of Texas.” Her lawyer Rodney Biggs feels the fact that the woman was trying to board a plane saw her treated as a flight risk. “The fact no one checked her middle name, her birth date,” Biggs said. “No information representing her person - they didn’t even check basic information that Bethany was not the other Bethany Farber.”The LAPD say they do not comment on pending litigation, a department spokesman told the Los Angeles Times.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PoliceCourt caseCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

While some turn to their favourite books, television shows and movies for inspiration, others seek advice from their close friends and family.But one dog owner regrets turning to her dad for help as her dachshundaposs name is constantly being misunderstood by strangers in the street. Sharing her embarrassment on Reddit, the owner explained how her dad named her dog Bag, which translates to Tasche in German.to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The woman can often be heard shouting for her dog in parks when trying to gain her attention, leaving other owners to question the unusual name. She said: Itaposs a funny name for a dog in general but I hate it when people want to know her name from curiosity. Itaposs just awkward for me, especially when they misunderstand her name and I have to repeat it. Wanting to avoid this awkward encounter in the future, the owner is pleading with people to refrain from questioning a dogaposs name when itaposs something they havenapost heard before. If you want to know, for example, the name of the dog of a pedestrian, and itaposs weird, donapost question it, she added.  Hoping to reassure the owner, one person said: You shouldnapost be ashamed of your dogaposs unique name. I doubt that she minds her name. I would suggest not reading too much into peopleaposs curiosity. We named our dog Chipotle after the restaurant. Itaposs an inside joke of my favourite place to eat when I met my we. Most people want to know why, and this gives me an opportunity to have a nice conversation with a stranger. View it as a positive. While another added: If theyaposre strangers you could just ignore them and pretend you donapost hear or understand. If people misunderstand the name that feels normal, buttheyaposre questioning or judging it thataposs not cool and I would just ignore them. Or you could make up a funny story like aposwell sheaposs so ugly that usually we make her wear a bag over her headapos or something ridiculous that freaks people out even more than the name. Sharing their own unusual dog names, one user said: I rarely tell people my dogaposs full name, Finlaggan, because I don’t want questions. The name has deeper meaning to me, but basically sheaposs named after a boat. Another added: My boyfriend has two cats - Gato and Girlfriend. Weird animal names are fun. People always think the name Girlfriend is weird, but he named her that because one day Gato, who used to be a stray, came home with her - and so it was like she was his girlfriend.

Another added: My boyfriend actually openly tells me that my dog and I are like the same. We both love belly rubs and demand for affection.

And one woman on TikTok has learned that lesson the hard way after she went to an artist specialising in tribal tattoos for her small and minimalistic design, and was left regretting her decision.Abigail Brady, who is from the US, shared a video in which she showed off the three small birds she wanted inked on her wrist, which were simple black silhouettes with wing and tail details.But instead, Abby received less defined black splodges - which some have compared tochicken footprints .Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The woman, who posts under the username @abigailkbrady, wrote in her video: Got a tattoo... and it definitely didnapost turn out [how I expected].She also wrote in the clipaposs caption: In the tattoo artists defence, he she specialises in tribal tattoos and not mini tattoos. And commenters were left in stitches by the womanaposs less than ideal inking. One said: It looks like chicken footprints. Oh gosh, noooo, another sympathetic commenter wrote.But Abby is taking the tattoo blunder in her stride, as she replied one comment agreeing that her ink does look like chicken feet, while also telling several others that she plans on having it removed or covered up. She said: Iaposm thinking about getting it removed or covered and starting over, but I donapost know. Abby definitely isnapost the only one of us to have received a bad tattoo, as several others have recently shared their experiences with disastrous inkings online.Earlier this week, we shared how Brittany Lewin was in love with her stylish pineapple tattoo - until she discovered the secret meaning behind the fruit.As it turns out, upside-down pineapples are apparently a secret sign used by swingers to identy those on the lookout for a swinger party - while a pineapple placed on the porch or mailbox of a house also signies a swinger party is currently going on inside. Swingers also reportedly identy each other in public by opting for clothes that feature the tangy tropical fruit. Brittany posted a video on TikTok with the caption: When you realise youaposve made a mistake.The woman also shared screenshots of the messages she exchanged with her friend, who initially asked herher tattoo was of an upside-down pineapple - before hinting that she might want to Google the truth.Check out Abigailaposs website hereDo you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TattoosViralUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old Brit found himself handcuffed with his hands behind his back while a gunman pointed a firearm towards him. The horrying ordeal happened in Amsterdam on Tuesday evening and a widely shared clip showed the terried hostage caught in a headlock with what looked like a gun pointed to his head inside the store. The hostage-taker was seen putting his arm around the hostage as they both looked at Apple products in the shop. After managing to bravely escape the gunman, the hostage was chased down the street before the captor was hit by a police car in Leidseplein - a square within the Dutch capital.  He was then seen lying on the street while a robot checked him for explosives. Another video clip from the scene showed around  armed police and specialist units swarming the street and taking cover. The incident started at around .pm, with the stand-off lasting nearly five hours. aposDozensapos of hostages were involved, the Daily Mail reports and most left the building by .pm, although itaposs understood some were allowed to leave slightly earlier. The incident was declared over by officers at around pm. “We can confirm that the hostage-taker is out of the Apple Store,” police said in a tweet last night.  “He is lying on the street and a robot is checking him for explosives. Armed police officers have him under control from a distance. The hostage is safe. Amsterdam police added: We managed to stop the hostage-taker by hitting him as he ran out. Violent images of that collision can be seen. We now know that the suspect had no explosives on his body and medical personnel are now taking care of him. One witness claimed they had to aposrun for their leapos after hearing gunshots, telling Dutch broadcaster AT: I was standing on the zebra crossing opposite the apple store. An employee walked out in panic with a walkie-talkie, yelling.  At that moment the penny hadnapost dropped yet and I was about to cross the zebra crossing opposite the entrance to the Apple store. And thataposs when I heard gunshots inside. According to the Associated Press, local Dutch broadcaster AT suggested the standoff was the result of an attempted armed robbery, although the motive wasnapost immediately clear. During the incident, members of the public were urged to stay away while officers dealt with the situation.

The Land Down Under implemented some of the strictest pandemic measures of any democracy back in March .It is the latest in a list of nations that have relaxed their coronavirus rules. Here are some of the countries that have recently changed their travel regulations, as collated by Liverpool Echo.  Australia As of February , , arrivals who are fully vaccinated will not need a travel exemption and will not be made to quarantine. Anyone entering the country is also required to complete an Australia Travel Declaration at least  hours before departure. The ATD includes a declaration regarding your vaccination status and you will be asked to upload your vaccination certicate. Unvaccinated visa holders will still need a valid travel exemption to enter Australia - and these will not be granted solely for tourism purposes.Inbound passengers must also provide a negative accepted Covid- test result.Australian states and territories also have their own Covid- rules, with the strictest enforced by Western Australia state which covers a third of the island continent.  Spain Spain introduced a huge change for holidaymakers this week as children over  from non-EU countries, such as the UK, now do not need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus to enter the country. The change came into force on Monday, February , ahead of the school half term. Adults who are fully vaccinated and travelling from the UK can enter Spain without needing to test or quarantine regardless of your reason for travel. The country also has new booster jab requirements which mean thatyou completed your vaccination course over nine months ago, youaposll need a booster jab to be considered fully vaccinated. However, adult Brits yet to receive both jabs can only enter the countrytheir reason for travel falls into one of the categories listed as essential. Morocco  After swtly closing its borders in October, Morocco is now welcoming fully vaccinated tourists again. Passengers must also present a negative PCR result, and download, print and sign a passenger health form before arrival in Morocco. Children under the age of  are exempt from the pre-travel PCR test requirement, and children under the age of  are exempt from the requirement to present a vaccine pass. France Only fully vaccinated Brits can visit for holidays without needing to quarantine. The country has scrapped Covid test requirements so fully vaccinated holidaymakers wonapost need a PCR or antigen test to visit.Unvaccinated travellers need an essential reason to visit. There are also new booster jab requirementsyou were vaccinated over  days ago. All passengers will also need to sign a apossworn statementapos confirming they are not showing symptoms of coronavirus, nor have they been in contact with a confirmed case within  days before travel to France.  Norway Norway’s border is now open as it was before the pandemic began. Most restrictions within the country have also been lted. All travellers arriving in Norway must complete registration prior to arrival. This also applies to Norwegian citizens. Arrivals must also take a test upon entering the country, regardless of their vaccination status. . Greece Greece is open to both vaccinated and unvaccinated Brits. Greece recently updated its rules so that fully vaccinated travellers will be exempt from Covid test requirements. Anyone over the age of  will need to fill out a pre-departure passenger locator form. If youaposre unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, you will need to show proof of a negative Covid test result. PCR tests can be taken within  hours of arrival, or antigen tests within  hours of arrival. Israel Israel will now allow unvaccinated tourists to enter from the beginning of next month. Its government announced the rule change on Sunday as the latest wave of the coronavirus recedes. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that foreign tourists, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, would be required to take PCR coronavirus tests before their flights and upon landing.

We need to do better than that. So who are the three oligarchs  Who is Gennady Timchenko  -year-old Gennady Timchenko is reportedly worth £. billion, according to Forbes.His private investment group, Volga, specialises in energy investments, among other opportunities and his net worth makes him the th richest person in the world.

He is also major shareholder in Rossiya, which supported the destabilisation of Ukraine after the annexation of Crimea in , according to the government.  Rossiya is also one of the five banks sanctioned by the UK. He reportedly once told a Russian news agency: You have to pay for everything in your le. Even for your friendship with the president. The government has imposed travel bans and frozen the assets of each billionaire listed in its first wave of sanctions.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: [This] will hit oligarchs and banks close to the Kremlin. It sends a clear message that the UK will use our economic heft to inflict pain on Russia and degrade their strategic interests.Who is Boris Rotenberg   Boris and Igor Rotenberg have both been sanctioned by the UK as the uncle and nephew respectively have reportedly got extremely close ties to Putinaposs regime. Forbes estimates that Borisapos net worth is around £ million thanks to his association with SMP bank, co-owned with brother Arkady, Igoraposs father.

In First Person: An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait, published in , he writes: “There were hordes of rats in the front entryway. My friends and I used to chase them around with sticks. ”Once I spotted a huge rat and pursued it down the hall until I drove it into a corner. It had nowhere to run. Suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me. I was surprised and frightened. Now the rat was chasing me.“Luckily, I was a little faster and I managed to slam the door shut in its nose. There, on that stair landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered.” The anecdote may be part of his carefully curated narrative, but it gives us a glimpse into the making of the man who now has the world holding its breath. Putin was born on October , , in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, a city that had been under siege for  days in the Second World War. More than a million people had died of starvation, many families entirely wiped out. In the war, Putin’s father, Vladimir, was away fighting, while his mother, Maria, almost starved to death. Putin writes: “Once my mother fainted from hunger. People thought she had died, and they laid her out with the corpses. Luckily Mama woke up in time and started moaning.” His father was one of only four of the  men in his unit to come home from the war, and for the rest of his le limped because of shrapnel injuries.The couple are believed to have lost their two older children, one to diphtheria during the war, the second from another childhood illness. Vladimir Putin was a “miracle baby” who arrived late. His communal home was dire, shared with two other families. His former school teacher Vera Dmitrievna Gurevich said: “There was no hot water, no bathtub. The toilet was horrendous. And it was so cold, awful.” Putin was a street kid, small for his age and bullied so he had to toughen up fast. Masha Gessen, author of The Man Without A Face: The Unlikely Rise Of Vladimir Putin, says: “Putin’s parents worked pretty much around the clock, his mother ious unskilled jobs, his father at a factory. He was left to his own devices. He hung out in the courtyard with other boys, like all children did.  “And he was often picked upon and bullied until he started studying Sambo, a version of martial arts, and then later switched to Judo so he could compete.” He is now a black belt and likes the world to know it, some even referring to his inner circle as a “Judocracy”. Putin reflected in : “ years ago the Leningrad street taught me a rule:a fight is inevitable you have to throw the first punch.” Masha says: “He’s scrappy, very ambitious, very, very greedy.”She says Putin’s doting parents fed that greed. He had a wristwatch as a teen – something his dad didn’t have. When they won a car they reportedly gave it to their student son. Masha suggests by treating him as their “king”, Putin’s parents gave him a sense of entitlement. She said: “There’s a lot of proof he feels he is chosen now.” The proof could include his sprawling “Putin’s Palace” home, and those photos of him riding horses bare-chested. More recently, making French President Emmanuel Macron sit at the other end of a ridiculously long table says everything about his need to feel superior. According to the Kremlin website, Putin wanted to work in intelligence “even before he finished school”, and volunteered at . He holds a law degree from Leningrad State University plus a doctorate in economics, and was picked from  or more students for the KGB.  Pavel Koshelev, a college classmate and fellow KGB officer, said: “His most outstanding trait, I would say, was his fighting spirit and his strong will to achieve his goals.’’ In the late s, Putin was posted to Dresden, East Germany, reportedly to work in counter-espionage. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he rose to become head of the KGB’s successor, the FSB, and then Boris Yeltsin’s successor when he resigned in . Putin said his KGB career prepared him for presidency. That discipline is still clear today as he works  and -hour days, something which took its toll on his family le. He married Lyudmila Putina, a former air hostess, in the mid-s and doted on their two daughters. After he and Lyudmila orced in , she reportedly said: “Our marriage is over due to the fact that we barely see each other. Vladimir is completely submerged in his work.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonEmmanuel MacronBoris YeltsinVladimir PutinUEFA Champions League FinalWorld War Petrol pricesBullyingPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN.

The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look.

They learn five fantastic songs in their own classrooms before Scottish Opera teaching artists arrive at the school for a morning to teach movement and choreography to prepare for a -minute performance in front of fellow pupils, friends and family.The opera tells the story of a spaceship arriving in orbit around Earth with occupants who have travelled across the galaxy to convince everyone of the need to join together and take action to protect the planet for future generations.Down on the planet#s surface, scientists and the military are at complete loggerheads about what to do next and it all seems pretty bleak…until the visitors bring them a message that they can’t ignore.New ferry berthing infrastructure at Dunoon and Kilcreggan could cost as much as £ million, a report has revealed.An outline business case is currently being prepared by Argyll and Bute Council for the redevelopment of the ferry infrastructure at the two terminals.And it is estimated that improvements at Dunoon could carry a £m cost, while proposals for Kilcreggan could cost anywhere between £m and £m.A new passenger access system, designed to fit a new vessel and give slacker gradients, has also been revealed as the council’s preferred option for Dunoon.The Gourock, Dunoon and Kilcreggan Infrastructure and Vessels Project is a collaboration between the council, Transport Scotland, CMAL and CalMac Ferries Ltd.The report was discussed at the virtual meeting of the Cowal Transport Forum on Wednesday, February . A public consultation is to be run by the council seeking the public#s views.Whisky producer J  A Mitchell  Co is switching its energy supply from gas oil to liquid gas at its two Campbeltown distilleries in a bid to operate more efficiently and avoid the imminent withdrawal of tax relief on red diesel.As a result of switching to Flogas at Springbank and Glengyle distilleries, the company hopes to cut energy costs by up to  per cent, even before the subsidy changes, while also reducing carbon emissions by more than  per cent.It will also minimise other pollutant emissions, making it compliant with the government#s Medium Combustion Plant Directive , which regulates against air pollution.Springbank, the larger of the two distilleries, has been in operation since , while Glengyle, just  metres away, was refurbished and re-opened in .Findlay Ross, director of production at J  A Mitchell  Co, said: #Springbank is an old distillery that was never designed with efficiency or sustainability in mind, so we#ve had to make improvements whilst making sure we don#t affect our original distillation process or popular final product.#It was the best way to make huge cost and emissions reductions in one go, without affecting our production process.#"},{"url":null,"title":"council eyes uk funds for whisky isles","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA replacement Jura ferry, improved connections between Islay#s ferry ports and electric buses all remain part of a bid for UK Government funding in Argyll and Bute.Updated plans for a bid to the Levelling Up Fund have been revealed in a council report, with all four administrative areas of Argyll and Bute proposed to benefit.Plans for the #whisky isles# are now part of a collective £million transport bid entitled #Connected Argyll and Bute#.The deadline for bids to the fund is likely to be around Easter, with the council also submitting a £m regeneration bid for projects in Dunoon and Rothesay.The report was before the authority’s policy and resources committee at its virtual meeting on February .A report to the full council in September  noted: #Both Islay and Jura have seen substantial growth in the output of their spirits industry that makes a substantial contribution to the UK Exchequer.#This project concerns an investment in the critical infrastructure of the islands principally, improvements to the local road network linking both the ferry terminals on Islay, including carriageway interventions, active travel investments and an electric bus service.#This project will also involve the replacement of the current Jura Ferry with a larger hybrid or electric ferry together with road improvements on Jura.#This work would complement proposed investment by CMAL at Port Ellen with capital contributions sought from the private sector. In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"tourism drive builds urban and rural links","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowPeople from Scotland’s towns and cities to are being invited to #Go Rural# and visit a nearby farm or croft in .The Go Rural campaign will encourage urban residents to get out into the countryside, buy food and drink directly from a farmer, visit a farm for the day or book an overnight break or holiday.As well as making people aware of what is on their doorstep, there will be a focus on building knowledge and awareness of the countryside code and how to keep humans and animals safe in the countryside.The campaign is being delivered by sector body Scottish Agritourism, using the Go Rural consumer facing brand with support from other farming, rural and tourism organisations.The investment is part of a destination and sector marketing fund administered by VisitScotland as part of the Covid recovery programme on behalf of the Scottish Government.Activities will include live tours on social media every weekend, blogs and guides featuring the nearest Go Rural farms where people can buy or eat farm produce, visit for a day out or take a quick weekend change of scene.A series of podcasts and videos will capture the stories of dferent farmers across Scotland and a number of social media influencers and journalists will also visit dferent locations.Scottish Agritourism members are being encouraged to host events on farm over the Easter break with many planning spring farm tours to complement another two weeks of the popular #Lambathon# live on social media in April, which will form part of the overall campaign.Caroline Millar, sector lead for Scottish Agritourism, said: #In Scotland,  per cent of the population lives on two per cent of the land in urban areas.#Farmers are not only keen to welcome urban residents to visit the countryside, but to buy food and drink directly from a farmer and to have the opportunity to be able to have those on-farm discussions about how Scotland’s food and drink is produced, and what farmers do to look after the environment and landscape.#Visiting a farm and providing access to green space is hugely beneficial to a person’s mental and physical wellbeing.#We do however have a responsibility as an organisation encouraging thousands of people to visit the countryside to explain the importance of how to leave only footprints and how to act responsibly for the safety of farm animals, wildle, and people.#Conversations about responsible tourism will be a key focus of the campaign, delivered in a way which will inform and build relationships.#Farmers and crofters who don’t have an agritourism business can also take part by sharing content and using #GoRural."},{"url":null,"title":"britains-top-5-holiday-destinations---see-list-book-flights","story":"Warmer weather isjust around the corner, and with travel restrictions easing in most destinations, many Brits will thinking about where to go for their next holiday.Using Google Trends data, Betwayanalysed where Brits are most excited to travel to this year.To help make your next holiday easier, we’ve used Skyscanner to help you find the best flight deals to these destinations in .Cape VerdeCape Verde was number  on the wish list for travel this year.

today. The First Minister was expected to address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policyand the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in Englandas of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic frameworkalso known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeonwill give an update to @ScotParlon #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAefrom :pm. pic LKTccbDIm— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , What did Nicola Sturgeon say today Boris Johnsons Living with Covid planNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.The First Minister criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.removeNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"jedburgh-skate-park-plans-submitted-scottish-borders-council","story":"IT has been more than a decade in the planning but a £k Borders skate park is now a step closer to reality.A Scottish Borders Council-supported hybrid concrete skate park and tarmac pump track in Jedburgh is earmarked for an area known locally as ‘The Dip’, on the south side of the A, the site of a demolished silk mill which has been flattened and grassed over.Now, with funding in place, a formal planning application has been submitted to the local authority’s planning department.It is hoped that in addition to giving town youngsters some much-needed recreational fun the facility will also attract an influx of visitors.:Borders weather: Region hit with further warnings for snow and windInverness-based wheeled sports experts Alan Jones Associates would oversee the workapproved – the company was the project manager on both the Kelso skateboard and Hawick pump track projects.If the plan is given the green light a series of drainage works will also need to be carried out on the site.A drainage report with the planning application states: “The site location is within a low-lying site surrounded by high ground to the north, west and south.“The Jed Water lies immediately east of the development site and the intention is to create a new drainage outfall to the river.“The drainage design for the site itself shall be developed alongside the detailed arrangement of the skate park and pump track to ensure that all areas remain free of standing water throughout the year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gusts-40-50mph-expected-scottish-borders---disruption-travel-likely","story":"Traffic Scotland are warning motorists in the Scottish Borders that some travel disruptions are likely today.

did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"Gigs in Scotland has today released the newsthat Calvin Harris will be coming to Scotland.The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"\" fill\"#\"View this post on InstagramtranslateY\"translateX translateYwidth: .pxflex-grow: margin-right: pxmargin-left: px\"translateY\"translateY rotate\"\"\"translateX\"A post shared by Gigs in Scotland The DJ and producer will also be ing to Creamfields this summer.

If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees.

only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin interment, but below the average for a cremation.

Nature-based solutions are part of the solution: planting trees, rewetting the flood plains, digging ponds, blocking ditches and drains – all natural common sense and all good value for public money.Compare these works with the £m required to remove and replace four bridges on the spurious grounds that they impede the flow. Impeding the flow upstream should be the preferred approach.By all means include a tree catcher at the A bridge, but add another one just upstream of the mill lade to catch the willows from The Grove that periodically fall into the river.

First Minister was expected to address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"connect-music-festival-relaunching-edinburgh-summer","story":"The event, from the organisers of T in the Park and TRNSMT, will be held at the Royal Highland Centre, on the outskirts of Edinburgh.The weekend-long festival is set to be held from August  to , with the line-up announced later this week, although organisers DF Concerts and Events have promised a range of bands, DJs, performers and more.Katt Lingard, festival manager, said the company was ‘really excited about bringing Connect to le’.“It’s a very unique site and it gives us a fantastic opportunity to create a truly sustainable approach to the festival experience,” she said.Connect Music Festival comes from the organisers of TRNSMT Festival in Glasgow.

As hellebores are native to woodland, they’ll enjoy plenty of organic matter, so make sure you add some when planting and add mulch from time to time to help retain the moisture in the soil. If you’re planting under trees, they will have to compete for water so you may need to provide water until it is well established. Once it’s well-rooted, the organic matter in the soil, the mulch and its broad leaves will generally maintain adequate moisture levels, although you may need to water occasionallythere’s a particularly dry spell.The real bonus with the hellebore is that, as a perennial, it will continue to grow bigger over time and after a few years you’ll be able to ide it into several plants – and all gardeners just love free plants!Garrya ellipticaSometimes known as the ‘silk tassel’ bush, this medium-sized evergreen shrub is native to coastal areas of America and so it’s quite happy in East Lothian gardens, where salty winds from the North Sea can be testing for our plants.This easy-to-grow shrub is a great addition to the garden, providing a backdrop to the vibrant colours in the summer garden. However, it really comes into its own in the winter garden, when the glossy green leaves provide welcome foliage and an abundance of beautul silk-like tassels at this time of year.Jasminum nudlorumMore commonly known as the winter-flowering jasmine, this deciduous shrub is unusual in that it flowers before producing its foliage.A robust, medium-sized shrub, it’s often trained against a wall or used as ground cover. It is happy in coastal areas and so ideal for our East Lothian gardens.The bright yellow flowers give a wonderful show at this time of year and are a sure sign that spring is on its way! It’s very easy to grow and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.CamelliaSometimes called the Japanese rose, camellias have been cultivated in Chinese and Japanese gardens for many centuries. When the tea trade expanded in the late s, Camellias were imported by the British East India Company for the wealthy British owners and by the s they were considered to be the luxury flower and the height of fashion.With its glossy green leaves and stunning flowers, the evergreen camellia is one of the first shrubs to flower each year.One of our most popular garden plants, it can be grown as a shrub or small tree, and comes in a huge range of dferent shapes, sizes and flower colours. It grows well in both containers and borders, but don’t forget that they prefer acidic soil. If your soil isn’t naturally acidic, add plenty of ericaceous compost around the roots when planting and maintain the pH level by feeding with fertiliser for acid-loving plants.Just one interesting fact – did you know that the most widely grown camellia on earth is the commercial crop, Camellia sinensis  Grown for its leaves, Camellia sinensis is none other than the tea plant, whose leaves are harvested for tea drinkers around the world!Hopefully we’ve given you some ideas that’ll help you add interest to your garden in February. If you’d like more information, please do call in and have a chat with our knowledgeable and experienced plant team – we just love to talk gardening!"},{"url":null,"title":"m-s-pancake-day-2022-range-including-percy-pig-frying-pan-mixes-sauces-spreads","story":"The Percy Pig Pancake Pan is £ and comes with a pancake batter squeezy bottle for precise batter application.MS is also selling a Pancake Party Gt Bag for £ which includes two pancake mixes, maple syrup and recipe cards.In the offer you will get: class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Stephen is passionate about pet nutrition.He said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Stephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully.

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Children from the area have participated in workshops with the local business owner and learned the ins and outs of bike mechanics while achieving formal qualications.Now, five years on from when he started, the project has expanded signicantly and recently moved into a building located in Robertson Park in Renfrew after receiving funding through community asset transfers by Renfrewshire Council.The Scot, who moved back to the country  years ago after growing up in South Africa, reflected on how far the community business has come and said why he started it in the first place.He said: “I started this with the ambition of purely helping kids who struggle like I once did in school.“I started by going round to the schools to do workshops, but after receiving funding through the council who gave us this property, we managed to get the new shop up and running, and we run workshops all day during the week.“The schools select the children who may struggle with mainstream education and send them down to our workshops. All our bikes are donated from the community, the council, or local skips and other bike shops. We then teach the kids how to diagnose the problems and how to fix anything on a bike. After that they are refurbished and sold back into the community at a very discounted price.“I’ve had a lot of friends in the past who have struggled in school and other areas of le and I just really want to help local youngsters to try make sure similar things don’t happen to them.”The local entrepreneur has received praise from the community in Renfrew and local councillors. Councillor John Shaw who represents Renfrew North and Braehead said Dave’s business has had an extremely positive impact on the area.He said: “Dave and the team at Kustom Kruizers have been a hugely positive addition to the local community doing some inspiring work with local schools and offering positive opportunities for young people to develop.“Their drive and vision shown in turning the formerly derelict public toilets into a valuable asset for the community is a shining example of how positively community asset transfers and partnership working can aid community development.”To mark the completion of the renovated building, Dave recently commissioned a mural on the projects new shop. The artwork shows Dave’s daughter fixing an old school rally burner, which he described as the most iconic BMX of all time.The mural was created by Renfrewshire artist, Bmoresketchy who said he was attracted to the project because of the ethos behind it.: Mural artist brings Renfrew primary schoolkids ideas to le in stunning mural projectBmoresketchy, whose real name is Stephen Blackmore, said: “I love doing commissions with a good story behind them. Painting murals which are just to look pretty come ten a penny, but when I get the chance to paint a piece with meaning it really draws me in.\"I think what Dave does for the community is really commendable. So, to be able to represent what Kustom Kruizers is all about in mural form was a fulfilling commission for me. The response from the public was incredible seeing the process too as they were full of encouragement and compliments as they passed.”Owner Dave Neil with artist Bmoresketchy With the new building, comes a newfound respect for what Dave says is a ‘hub’ for local kids. In the six months he has had the building there has been not one incident of vandalising or graffiti.With the success of the project now coming to le in front of Dave, he now has ideas for a bigger future, and national expansion is on his mind.He said: “I started this to try help keep kids out of trouble, and I want this to be just the first for Kustom Kruizers. I hope to have this successfully running for a few years, and then approach other councils within Scotland and let them know that they need this.“I’d love it as a franchise across the country that helps give back to all areas and get everyone back into cycling.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-ridiculous-use-chernobyl-damn-nuclear-power","story":"If Mr Patrick thinks we should shut down all nuclear power stations, presumably he also thinks we should ban flying. The USSR was desperate to be the first country in the world to produce a commercial supersonic airliner and built the Concordski, a straight rip-off of the British-French Concorde. Concordski first flew on December , , two months before its rival. One crashed at the Paris Air Show in , another in , and that was pretty much the end of Concordski.Having spent my working le as a pilot, it’s sad to see that the wonder of air travel has been almost entirely lost. There you are, sitting in moderate comfort while you travel at  mph, six miles above the earth outside, separated from you by a thin skin, the air temperature is -C and there’s very little oxygen. An incredibly dangerous thing to do, but made safe to the point of being mundane by technology, design and human skill. It’s the same in the nuclear industry: there are several hundred nuclear power plants operating safely around the world, and extrapolating from one episode at Chernobyl is ridiculous.Frances McKieclaims that nuclear is “a technology that does not work”. Ms McKie had better let the citizens of France know, as they get  per cent of their electricity from nuclear indeed they sell some of it to us when the wind doesn’t blow. There’s no one solution to the energy and climate crises we face, but it would be the height of foolishness to put all our eggs in the rather unreliable basket of wind, solar and tidal.Dough Maughan, Dunblane.SO DID WE REALLY WIN THE WAR SOME historians believe that Russia and China pose a lower threat than did Germany after its  invasion of Czechoslovakia.But, inter alia, the United States was the emerging dominant power, the UK with the Empire was still militarily important, China was relatively insignicant, and our enemies had no nuclear weapons. There was no Russia China Iran axis or equivalent controlling Europe’s energy supply, much of its economic needs, and with growing influence throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa and South America.Will the democracies’ leaders now accept that not only did the West not “win the Cold War”, but that,our enemy was not only Hitler’s Germany but all \"nazi\" states, it is also premature to claim we won the Second World War  Both wars merely paused, while the totalitarians whether red, brown or black-shirted, secular or religious, engaged in “reculer pour mieux sauter”.With its rise and its cyber warfare abilities, and our lack of leadership and self-confidence, that axis can peel away salami-fashion at the democracies’ weaknesses to impose its Orwellian future on the world while avoiding major military operations against us.John Birkett, St Andrews.BANK COMPLAINTS SYSTEM IS WOEFULI RECENTLY had occasion to lodge a complaint against the Bank of Scotland. The frustration that led me to complain in the first place was greatly intensied by the complaints process itself, which seems to operate on the principle that the customer is always wrong, despite manest failings on the bank’s part. In my case, these included a nonsensical response to my initial written request – requesting a signature that was already on my letter: a denial that the bank had my mobile number, despite the fact that I received two identical text messages from the bank to that number a failure to send a promised form that the bank said I must complete and sloppy addressing of correspondence to me.The matter is still not resolved. I have been told it will take up to eight weeks to reach a decision on what should be a simple matter – closing a small account for a group of residents in a block of flats . I am one of the approved signatories to the account, with all transactions requiring two approved signatures. An unnamed complaints manager will phone me within an unspecied time scale. And, of course,I am not satisfied, I can take my case to the Financial Conduct Authority. That’s no comfort at all, as people have lost faith in regulatory bodies. They are seen as heavily stacked in favour of big institutions and against inidual complainants.No doubt many other people will have had similar experiences.Walter Humes, Newton Mearns.ENGLISH LESSON FOR THE BBCLEAH Gunn Barrettsays the BBC always puts England first.

I think when you’re looking at the last couple of games and you’re looking at our performances I think our performances were good but we were missing this clinical finishing and I think today our game was more complete and we defended well, we used the ball quite well,” the Palace boss said.“We stick together in a dficult period and when we had chances we scored in an important moment of the game and overall it was a really good team performance.”Hodgson was left to rue defensive mistakes after his Watford side were unable to build momentum following on from their first win since November at Aston Villa on Saturday.“Well we lost for a start, that’s probably the most important thing that went wrong, we were hoping to build on the good result at the weekend, at home, in another game,” Hodgson said when asked what went wrong in the match.“But unfortunately we didn’t and we were punished quite heavily for the few defensive mistakes we made in and around our box.“I don’t honestly believe it was a - game, I don’t think that at - with us still trying our best to get back into the game it looked as though we were going to lose it -, but unfortunately these things do happen.“We tried our best for an equaliser during the second half, passed the ball around reasonably well, but the game is about goals and when they got the ball in and around our penalty area without creating lots and lots of chances they scored four of the chances they created.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

can use after authorities ended the blockades at the borders and the occupation in Ottawa by hauliers and others opposed to Covid- restrictions.Mr Trudeau said the “threat continues” but the acute emergency that included entrenched occupations has ended.His government invoked the powers last week and politicians affirmed the powers late Monday.“The situation is no longer an emergency, therefore the federal government will be ending the use of the emergencies act,” Mr Trudeau said.“We are confident that existing laws and bylaws are sufficient.”\" data-title\"Virus Outbreak Canada Protests\"

Ottawa The emergencies act allows authorities to declare certain areas as no-go zones.It also allows police to freeze hauliers’ personal and corporate bank accounts and compel tow truck companies to haul away vehicles.The haulier protest grew until it closed a handful of Canada-US border posts and shut down key parts of the capital for more than three weeks.But all border blockades have now ended and the streets around the Canadian Parliament are quiet.“We were very clear that the use of the emergencies act would be limited in time,” Mr Trudeau said.Mr Trudeau had warned earlier this week there were some hauliers just outside Ottawa who might be planning further blockades or occupations.His public safety minister also said there was an attempt to block a border crossing in British Columbia over the weekend.The protests, which were first aimed at a Covid- vaccine mandate for cross-border hauliers but also encompassed fury over the range of Covid- restrictions and hatred of Mr Trudeau, reflected the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger.The self-styled Freedom Convoy shook Canada’s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted trade, causing economic damage on both sides of the border.\" data-title\"Virus Outbreak Canada Protests\" data--holder\"AP\" data--notice\"AP Press

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

It needs re-energised, buildings need to be painted, and it feels like after the Primark fire the area was neglected, Mr McKenna told this week#s Business .“We’re about to invest in a new site there and I’m thinking, should we do it  I’m very saddened because it seems like the city hasn’t moved on and we should’ve been better prepared after Covid.“There are homeless people on the streets and for years it’s been the same faces. We’re doing what we can by giving out hot food but they’re still there and with a city this size, it’s a disgrace.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Following these comments, the Belfasttook to the streets to get the views of other businesses.Richard Smyth of MacFarland and Smyth Estate Agents said they have been one of the oldest occupiers in the Cathedral Quarter and that they “love it.Business owners do get frustrated about the people lying about the area, he said.Mr Smyth said some business owners like publican Willie Jack, who owns the nearby Duke of York pub and other establishments, have taken it upon themselves to keep the area clean.He added: Sometimes you are fighting a losing battle because there are people on the margins of society here and a lot of graffiti and that kind of stuff... we#re cleaning graffiti off our building every other week.I can understand Niallfrustrations at times, because some people are destroying the place, but what can you do  I think the Cathedral Quarter is being run the best it can. You might have got Niall at a bad day, but this place is not a dump.When askedthe Cathedral Quarter is a #dump#, Mr Jack said the area is not what it once was.It was a lot more artistic before the speculators came in... The council could do more, but too many people are staying at home and are just talking about Belfast, when Belfast needs to be the driver for the province, he said.The people at the top of a lot of organisations are far removed from understanding what Belfast needs. They don#t come down and see it. Certainly,  years ago, it was a lot more artistic and a lot safer, in my opinion.How do we solve it  I think we need join up people coming down at night to actually see what#s going on. We certainly pay enough in rates, we pay almost £, for two premises and we don#t get good value.Flora Herberich of Circusful, the Belfast circus school, said the Cathedral Quarter is a destination for visitors.She said: I wouldn#t call it a dump. Some places have closed down because of Covid and hopefully they#ll reopen again soon. North Street Arcade is lying derelict and there#s the empty Northern Bank building, so there is space to regenerate the area more.”Most ReadSammy Wilson confuses Ukraine with Sinn Fein in House of CommonsSchools# Cup hockey semi-finals: Methody to face Armagh Royal in final after tight victories at Comber RoadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceMan found dumped in Co Antrim field was stabbed near heart and attacked with hatchet after row over drugs, court toldTerror at Lisburn shopping centre after rampage by ‘armed’ manTop VideosPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and knePlayBelfast publican hits out at council over state of Belfast Cathedral Quarter areaPlayVideo: #I have lost a dear dear friend# - Paula Bradley pays tribute to Christopher Stalford Latest Northern IrelandSnow and lightning warnings as severe flooding risks remainSir Jeffrey Donaldson denies that he considered rejoining Ulster UnionistsWarm tributes after death of yer man Sammy Mackie at DUP denies blame for exacerbating health service crisis in Northern IrelandUK ‘tough talk’ on Ukraine not matched with action on NI Protocol, rally hearsLatestEngland team ‘growing really fast’ after victory over Germany – Sarina WiegmanHalyna Hutchins’ husband: ‘It’s absurd Alec Baldwin did not take responsibility for her death’Ukraine’s president in plea for peace as he warns of cost of war with RussiaRalf Rangnick urges Manchester United players to try to emulate Anthony ElangaSnow and lightning warnings as severe flooding risks remain,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There was a stillness in the corridors before members filed into the chamber.Around the base of the Great Hall’s famous Stormont steps, in the moments before the Assembly was due to meet, the DUP team stood in quiet reflection following the sudden death of Christopher Stalford MLA, aged just .Read MoreWarm tributes paid across political benches at Stormont to Christopher StalfordSuzanne Breen:OpinionBlessed with insight and wit, talking with Christopher was never dullThey took a moment, led in prayer by Mervyn Storey, heads bowed at the passing of their colleague and friend. There was silence as MLAs took their seats.They all have their places.

A ceasefire akin to the Christmas truce of  when the British and German forces met in no man’s land, exchanged gts and even played a friendly game of football.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As then, hostilities at Stormont will resume, but at noon on Monday there was little appetite for the usual cut and thrust. Party politics was set aside. Only one item was on the agenda. The House paid its respects and heard the fine words of tribute to Christopher Stalford.One by one his colleagues and rivals stood to deliver the words they did not wish to say. And it was, in a strange way, lovely to hear them say these words and know they meant every one of them.Gone were the tones of bitterness. Gone, too, the cutting cross-party interjections, those with which Christopher Stalford was so prolic during his time in the Assembly.Speaker Alex Maskey opened the Assembly and told of how their backgrounds came from dferent perspectives of le here, but how they had formed a very positive working relationship.But it will be among the ranks of the DUP that Christopher Stalford will be most missed by those who knew him best.As Mr Maskey gave way to DUP deputy leader, Paula Bradley, she stood, wearing black and clutching a handkerchief. You could tell tears were not far away as she began by saying she wished to “honour and give thanks for the le of our much-loved friend and esteemed colleague”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respects FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respectsShe added: “Words cannot adequately explain the sense of pain and loss that is felt on these benches. Christopher’s joy came not in holding office but in how he could use that office to improve the everyday lives of those he was honoured to represent. It was a mark of the man that he had friends on all sides of this chamber.”Very quickly that became apparent. Across the chamber, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey led the tributes from Sinn Fein due to the absence of Michelle O’Neill, who’s self-isolating at home due to Covid.She said: “Sadness has fallen upon this chamber. No words can describe the shock, anguish and pain his family is feeling.“I first met Mr Stalford at Belfast City Council and instantly thought he was older than me due to his mannerisms and the attire of his pinstriped suit, initially thinking this was the instructed unorm of all DUP councillors at that time.“He enjoyed the cut and thrust of debate in committees and the debating chamber. While our politics dfered, we shared similarities, growing up in working-class communities in south Belfast.”Mrs O’Neill later tweeted: “I’m struck by the shared sense of loss across the political spectrum. I am reminded that there is far more that unites us than ides us. Rest in peace Christopher.”For almost two-and-half hours, tributes came from all corners of the house, and MLAs also stood respectfully in a minute’s silence.From the SDLP, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said: “This is a very sombre day for our Assembly, but particularly for Christopher Stalford’s friends and colleagues in the DUP.“I got to know a man who was challenging, argumentative, ambitious, some may even say combative, during debates, but also a man who was kind, quick-witted, fiercely intelligent and very funny. Christopher Stalford was unique.”Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie echoed what many in the Assembly had felt when they heard the tragic news.“My heart sank,” he said.“I have no quick quip to truly outline the person that we all knew, that we all had interactions with. Christopher was unique, absolutely unique. He was a fierce debater. I didn’t just like Christopher Stalford, I was jealous of Christopher Stalford.”There was none of the usual passion from TUV leader Jim Allister, a man rarely lost for words. In fact, they struggled to come today.The tributes continued throughout the session, but perhaps most enlightening was the insight into the person behind the political mask worn in public.The anecdotes from committee rooms and back corridors of power, even the tales of casual conversations between rivals MLAs. Not agreeing about something doesn’t always mean the respect, even the friendship, of those from rival parties doesn’t exist.Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “I did not expect this morning, that I would be standing here paying tribute to him in these circumstances. But it doesn’t surprise me at all that my last conversation with him was about his children and his family, because they were at the heart of everything he did.”Those on the sharpest end of his tongue will miss his presence too.Sinn Fein’s Emma Sheerin added: “You knew that when you met him outside you’d be met with warmth, a bit of craic, good humour, and a genuine friendly comment.”Her party colleague, John O’Dowd, said: “Christopher Stalford was a formidable political opponent. There were times when I debated with Christopher that I tried not to like him afterwards, but I couldn’t. He was such an affable inidual.”The sharp suits, the sharp tongue – it will all be missed at Stormont.But Christopher Stalford, as all those who paid their respects noted, will be even more sorely missed by the family he has left behind.Most ReadSammy Wilson confuses Ukraine with Sinn Fein in House of CommonsShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceSchools# Cup hockey semi-finals: Methody to face Armagh Royal in final after tight victories at Comber RoadBelfast shop staff being ‘traumatised’ by street preachers with ampliers, council toldTerror at Lisburn shopping centre after rampage by ‘armed’ manTop VideosPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and knePlayBelfast publican hits out at council over state of Belfast Cathedral Quarter areaPlayVideo: #I have lost a dear dear friend# - Paula Bradley pays tribute to Christopher Stalford Latest PoliticsNorthern Ireland ‘undersold’ in first round of City Deal fundingGet Stormont up and running again, NIO minister Conor Burns tells DUP’s DonaldsonGAA set to issue guidance as Tyrone club is criticised for memorial to IRA menSammy Wilson confuses Ukraine with Sinn Fein in House of CommonsSinn Fein favours a single .% corporation tax for smaller firms on both sides of borderLatestJurgen Klopp insists Liverpool will not get carried away after win over LeedsPremature Pippa back home thanks to NI firm’s ‘D heart’Patrick Vieira hails Wilfried Zaha’s best Palace performance since he took overMaybe I am not so good – Antonio Conte appears to question his Tottenham futureBruno Lage always knew fearless fighter Raul Jimenez would lead frontline again,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

A summer festival could focus on this heritage which can be linked with the increase in walking in the Mournes.Cllr Clarke believes there should also be a nautical aspect of a new summer festival, celebrating the rich maritime history of the area.He added: ldquoThere is potential to build on the resortrsquos outdoor water sports or perhaps launch a regional dish competition, opportunities which present the chance to showcase everything is good about Newcastle for visitors and locals alike..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Final four spot for Down High  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos first XV entertained familiar rivals Omagh Academy in Downpatrick on Saturday morning for their quarter-final tie in the Danske Bank Subsidiary Shield.The two sides met in the opening fixture of the season with Omagh winning - on that occasion.The game didnrsquot get off to an ideal start for Down High when in the first minute, number eight, Rhodri Phillips, made an uncharacteristic error that provided Omagh with a  to cross for an unconverted try in the corner.Within minutes Phillips had made amends when he finished off an excellent Down High multi-phase attack scoring under the posts and leaving himself with a straightforward conversion which he duly slotted over.Omagh, who were playing with the strong wind on their backs in the opening half, applied most of the pressure for the next period of the game and after Joseph Dooley was carded for an accumulation of penalties by the home side, Omagh opted for the posts and added three points to regain the lead.In the th minute, a Down attack that was reminiscent of the one that had led to their opening score, brought play deep into Omagh territory where captain, Cameron McCaughey, showed great footwork and power to e over under the sticks for a try which Phillips easily converted.Omagh were not to leave the first half without reply.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead. Indeed in the view of many people the road will have to go ahead.Another councillor has already suggested a dferent potential line which is understood to cut through part of the Down High School playing fields.CLOUGH ndash Clough Presbyterian Church Hall was built in , is being demolished to make way for a car park beside the new hall which is nearing completion.However, not all of the historic structure is being discarded. The original pitch pine rafters, Bangor Blue slates and main entrance doors have been kept. The congregation formally bade farewell to the hall during a recent thanksgiving service which church minister, Rev Robert Craig, pointed out its important to the congregation over a period of almost  years.The new hall will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.NEWCASTLE ndash Health chiefs have voted ldquoin principle for the closure of a Newcastle holiday home for mentally handicapped people.A proposal to close Navan House, on the Tollymore Road, has been overwhelmingly backed by the Southern Health Board.A final decision on the homersquos future will be taken after a period of consultation likely to last a couple of months.Navan House is the second public sector home in Newcastle to be earmarked for closure. The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September. If that happens, there is no reason why we cannot be in production by next April..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilcoo win All Ireland  ","story":"KILCOOrsquos triumphant senior footballers ed home to jubilant scenes on Saturday night after their dramatic extra-time win over the much-fancied Kilmacaud Crokes in a pulsating All-Ireland Club final at Croke Park.Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the clubhouse at Paacuteirc Eoghan Rua as the Andy Merrigan Cup was proudly laid on the village pitch for the first time ever.Indeed it was the first time that the coveted All-Ireland title was back in Down since the all-conquering Burren side brought it home in .After one of the most dramatic finals in recent history last weekend, Kilcoo players finally got their hands on the trophy, confirming the sidersquos place as the best in Ireland.After going so close in  when the Galway-based Corofin snatched the cup from the locals in extra time, there was no heartache last weekend with Kilcoorsquos late late show securing victory.Amid wild celebrations at the final whistle, assistant manager Conleth Gilligan spoke of an ldquoenormous sense of relief.He continued: ldquoWe are delighted to get over the line, for so many reasons.

They say residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades.Council chairwoman, Cathy Mason, was one of a number of local politicians provided with a progress report on the Newcastle project last week by senior council directors.She described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as really welcome news.She continued: ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike and I am delighted that the plans are in the final stages. The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This piece is a genuine and authentic step in the trials process and as such of great numismatic signicance. Its appeal will be just as great to the hardcore numismatist as it will to the ‘investor collector’. “I can easily imagine a collector who has spent several hundreds of thousands of pounds on an original  Una and the Lion quite happily spending the same to have this piece sit next to the original in their collection.”The trial pieces are not official UK coins and are ‘one of one’ items – meaning they are not included in the mintage figures.To register for the auction, visit The Royal Mint website here.Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Picture: WSPThe first option would see a segregated cycle and pedestrian path through an old railway line, from Cosmeston Drive in Sully to Railway Walk in Penarth. This would involve clearing out a lot of overgrown vegetation on the railway line, and could be an expensive option.The second option would see the existing pavement on Lavernock Road widened, for shared use between pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit would be reduced from mph to mph along this part of Lavernock Road. This option would be the cheapest.The third option would combine parts of the first two. It would use the old railway line halfway, from Cosmeston Drive to St Mary’s Well Bay Road, before then crossing Lavernock Road and continuing on the pavement until Sully.The consultation website said: “There is a growing need to reform the way people travel between destinations using private vehicles. Providing good quality active travel infrastructure is an important component in negating the need for people to own vehicles.“Active travel infrastructure may also be used as a tool to improve physical and mental well being and mitigate the impact of private vehicles on the environment.“By providing one of these proposed route options, we can facilitate a modal sht from the private car to active modes for short distances to either Sully, Cosmeston and Penarth.”.removePeople interested in responding to the consultation have until March  to do so, by visiting the website: sullyactivetravelmonplace.is Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA dog is seen by many as another member of the family but it’s important to remember they do require a dferent diet to humans and some ingredients in pancakes could lead to tummy troubles of even health problems like diabetes.Not wanting pups to miss out, Ocado have partnered with an expert in pet nutrition to create a recipe which is safe for dogs – even those with particularly sensitive tums.Stephen Ward is the Founder of Heights Farm Premium Pet Foods – a high-quality, independent pet food manufacturer designed for animals with allergies and intolerances. Stephen is passionate about pet nutritionHe said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”When is Pancake day This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Dog-friendly pancake recipeStephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.Tips for a healthy pancake day with your dogIf you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s health:As always, make sure your dog has access to plenty of fresh clean drinking water.Adjust your dog’s daily feeds to account for the extra calorie intake.As with all treats, remember to serve these pancakes in moderation. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acbdbcbaeadff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efcaabfdebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acbdbcbaeadff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efcaabfdebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645540082194.jpg--covid_19___tue_22nd_february_figures.jpg?164554008200","title":"covid  tue nd february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
