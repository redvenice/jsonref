In Folkestone, Kent, visitors slept on the beach in deck-chairs.Meanwhile, four-deep queues stretched for 200 yards beyond the entrance to Bristol Zoo, a local newspaper revealing how the holiday had led to ‘a great deal of work for Rosie the elephant who earned eight shillings a minute by carrying small boys and girls upon her back, and made at least 1,000 threepenny trips each day’.At a park near the centre of bombed-out Coventry, that Easter was an interlude where, for a few hours at least, it might be imagined that the war had never happened. ‘Fathers fussed with the intricacies of clockwork motor-boats, youngsters sailed yachts, and here too were the recumbent figures of Conventrians who found sunshine sleepy.’The same tranquillity could be found at religious services across the country and in Sittingbourne, Kent, there were ‘crowded congregations at all churches’.The usual Easter treats were a problem because even those foods not still on the ration were in short supply during those years of post-war austerity.         In April 1949, temperatures reached 84.9F (29.4C) in London’s Camden Square and over the next few days we are set to enjoy weather which will be almost as glorious. Pictured: crowds watch a Chelsea versus Derby County football match during the Easter heatwave         A group of holidaymakers took advantage of the warm Easter weekend in 1949 by driving down to the beach in Eastbourne, Sussex         From towns and cities across the country, there was an exodus to the seaside, with Blackpool alone expecting 150,000 visitors, 90,000 arriving on 119 specially time-tabled trains. Pictured: Newquay in Cornwall in 1949         The other 60,000 were expected to travel by bus or car, and although Britain then had only two million motorists — compared to 45 million today — the AA predicted that most of them would be out. Pictured: children making sandcastles on the beach at Broadstairs in Kent in 1949Shortly before Easter, a 40-seater plane had flown in from Montreal, delivering four tons of bacon and eggs, a gift from the Canadian people to enable 2,500 families in all parts of Britain to have ‘a real non-austerity Easter breakfast’.But, with confectionery to be rationed until 1953, chocolate Easter eggs were few and far between. There was better news about hot cross buns, said to be more extensively available than in previous years, even if, as one master baker admitted, ‘we cannot guarantee they will be as good as pre-war buns’.For those wanting to make their own Easter treats, the cookery writer Marguerite Patten offered a recipe for simnel cake covered with ‘mock marzipan’ — an eggless version of the real thing.For the main course, English lamb was still a rarity, so Sunday lunch for many consisted of mutton or imported beef. But they could at least brighten up their table, as according to the Derby Daily Telegraph, ‘the sunshine sent flower sales soaring and shoppers went home with bunches of spring flowers. Daffodils and narcissi were cheap from 1s. 3d a dozen’.After a visit to the florist, the thriftier housewife might follow the same newspaper’s advice for ‘brightening up your dress and hair with spring flowers’. ‘Do not overdo it,’ the paper sternly cautioned.         Easter holidaymakers on a Thames river bus watch as a group of rowers go under Tower Bridge          U.S. swimmer and actor Johnnie Weissmuller, most famous for his role as Tarzan, is lifted by a group of showgirls on the beach with Blackpool Tower in the background in 1949‘Too many will be worse than none at all.’Wise words, but unnecessary for the showgirls of the Embassy Club in London’s Mayfair, who wore broad-brimmed Edwardian hats and carried lacy parasols as they joined the traditional Easter Parade in Hyde Park, the first to be held since the war.Thousands of holidaymakers lined the route to see celebrities including comedian Terry Thomas and actress and singer Gracie Fields. She wore an Easter bonnet of straw and flowers, ‘and a real Lancashire smile’ but could not compete with an array of ladies’ hats that ‘mostly offered neither shade from the sun nor shelter from the rain, but were all so very attractive’.Let’s hope we can all have as much fun as those who smile out at us from those newspaper pages. People who may not have had chocolate eggs or palatable hot cross buns, but till managed to enjoy what was, in the words of the Western Daily Press, was ‘the best Easter holiday in memory’.

I chopped my finger for the mistake, he told news agency ANI.He cut off the digit marked with the indelible ink to show he had voted, according to media reports and an online video apparently showing the aftermath.Mr Kumar, who is from a village in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, said he voted for the BJP\u0027s sitting lawmaker Bhola Singh instead of the Bahujan Samaj Party\u0027s Yogesh Verma.The widely-shared video shows Mr Kumar sitting on a chair with his index finger wrapped in bandage. When asked if he was forced to press on the BJP button, he said no.Mr Verma was fielded by the alliance of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party and Ajit Singh\u0027s Rashtriya Janata Dal.The BJP\u0027s Bhola Singh got a notice from the Election Commission  after he was seen campaigning at an election booth in Uttar Pradesh\u0027s Bulandshahr in another video.Meanwhile, in a shock move a spokeswoman for India\u0027s main opposition Congress party quit on Friday and joined rightwing Hindu nationalist party Shiv Sena, complaining of aggresion towards her by male party members was ignored.The resignation of Priyanka Chaturvedi, a regular on prime-time TV debates, is an embarrassing setback for Congress in the middle of a general election, and again raises the contentious issue of the treatment of women in India.A serious incident and misbehaviour against me by certain party members while I was on official duty for the party has been ignored under the guise of all hands needed for elections, Chaturvedi wrote in the letter to Congress President Rahul Gandhi, and posted on Twitter.The next round of voting will be on April 23.

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Still, it was pretty cynical of the retailer to leave it until 3pm on the day before the extended Easter weekend to confirm\u0026nbspthe widely trailed departure.\u0026nbsp“Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future,” said the former Amazoner who must wish he’d never left the internet giant.\u0026nbspDebenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Debenhams falls into administrationMike Ashley calls for Debenhams bosses to take lie detector testsSure, being the ultimate boss holds a powerful pull even for executives with fancy jobs at prestigious companies. But Debenhams was on a sticky wicket when he joined and the warning signs should have been obvious enough to him.\u0026nbspTurning the business around was always going to be a tough ask, one made all the more difficult by the requirement to fend off Sports Direct kingpin Mike Ashley, who ultimately got Bucher booted off the board for his trouble.\u0026nbspBut we’re always being told people like him are rare talents with the ability to fly, run around the world at\u0026nbspsix million miles an hour, shoot lasers from their eyes\u0026nbspand turn retailing sows ears and into silk purses while they’re at it. That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term\u0026nbspit still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone.

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab317 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material.

colleagues for their efforts and dedication during such a turbulent time, as well as our suppliers, partners and of course customers for their continued support.”Mr Bucher had already been forced off

future and we have Sergio and his team to thank for that.“With a positive, professional approach, he has acted at all times in the company\u0027s best interests, and we wish him all the best for the future.”The company’s 165 stores will initially continue to trade\u0026nbspbut 50 have been earmarked for closure within three to five years, putting around 4,000 jobs at risk.Debenhams has struggled to adapt to rising competition from online competitors and a general decline of high street shopping.It has also been saddled with high costs from its large number of stores.Only the best news in your

And Sats for Year 6 pupils are here to stay.Labour will abolish Sats exams in primary schools, Jeremy Corbyn saysIn fact, children in primary schools will also face a times-tables check next year on top of the already unpopular phonics tests under the government’s assessment system.So why do the controversial primary school tests still exist? Nick Gibb, the schools minister, argues that the exams raise standards and improve children’s reading and maths before secondary school.Ministers say that pressure shouldn\u0027t be\u0026nbspplaced on\u0026nbspchildren\u0026nbspas the exams are there only\u0026nbspto measure schools.Created with Sketch.Back to school: children attend class around the world Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A student stands in the ruins of one of his former classroomsUnicefClarke for UNSitan Doumbia, 5, plays with her friends at the Early Childhood Development Center in Mali330 Democratic Republic of the CongoTeacher Edouard Kabukapua, 28, accompanies his students as they sing on their way to their class in a temporary tent school in Mulombela village, KasaÃ¯ region, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

And the pressure has been passed down to the kids.Some argue that abolishing Sats would also make it harder for parents to know how good schools are at teaching core subjects, with these\u0026nbspresults used in league tables and Ofsted ratings.However, many parents are willing to have less information in order to save their child from the tougher assessments that leave many feeling stressed out.Standing up in front of teachers\u0026nbspwho have been disillusioned with the primary school testing regime for years\u0026nbspand calling for the abolition of exams\u0026nbspis an easy gig for Corbyn.

That press conference began a day of intense interest in the findings of the Mueller report, released shortly after, meaning Facebook\u0027s update was less scrutinised than it might otherwise have been.Facebook also opted not to post a new bl\u0026nbspog post about the findings, instead disclosing the update by tweaking an old blog post, which was originally posted a month ago.Facebook likes and Snapchat streaks could be bannedIt had already disclosed that some passwords had been made available in plain text, allowing employees to search through them. But at the time it said only that tens of thousands of people had been affected.It will inform the millions of users that were caught up in the attack, it said. Facebook claimed its investigation determined that these stored passwords were not internally abused or improperly accessed.In March, when the privacy failure was first disclosed, it said the issue had affected\u0026nbsphundreds of millions of Facebook\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspusers and millions of Facebook users.\u0026nbspFacebook\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspis designed for people with older phones or slow\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspconnections.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the participants in the study this amounted to an average difference of two stone (13kg) by middle age, between the most affected and protected groups.The researchers, led by\u0026nbspMIT\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspHarvard Medical School, have\u0026nbspdeveloped this into a genetic “risk score” which can show how great someone’s risk might be, and which could potentially be used from birth to take protective action.“We have always had a hunch that some people may have been born with a genetic profile that predisposes them to obesity, and we now confirm that this is both true and quantifiable,” said Dr Amit Khera, one of the authors and a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.Created with Sketch.Health news in pictures Show all 44Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.144 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.244 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2844 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3444 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3544 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 144 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.244 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. However, Dr Khera said,\u0026nbsp“DNA is not destiny” when it comes to weight gain and a “healthy diet and exercise can offset a genetic predisposition”.“It is also likely true that those with a high genetic predisposition have to work much harder to maintain a normal weight,” he added.The research, published in the journal Cell, analysed more than 2\u0026nbspmillion genetic variants known to have an impact on body-mass index (BMI), some which will increase obesity and some which will be protective.Hancock accused of ‘astonishing ignorance’ after taking genetic testThis data comes from more than 300,000 people who have added their health and genetic information to research libraries, however, the mostly European population means the applicability of findings to other groups is less certain.It found that the top 10 per cent of people with the most genetic variants linked to a higher BMI also had\u0026nbspdouble the risk of weight-related type 2 diabetes of those in the most protected category.Obesity causing liver disease ‘time bomb’ in teens and young adultsPatients lose weight with stomach blood supply-blocking treatmentTest revealing genetic risk of disease has ‘no impact on lifestyle’ Because these are average scores there could be much heavier or lighter iniduals within both the most genetically at risk group, and the least.But looking at them as a group the researchers said that by age three they could begin to see the effects of the\u0026nbsphigher genetic risk showing in children’s weight. By age eight this high risk group were 3.5kg heavier.While these findings don’t affect the weight they are born, the effects begin to be seen by childhood and play out into adulthood, also affecting the risk of weight-related conditions like type 2 diabetes.“The score is associated with only minimal differences in birth weight, but it predicts clear differences in weight during early childhood and profound differences on weight trajectory and risk of developing severe obesity in subsequent years,” says senior author Sekar Kathiresan of the Broad Institute.The authors say that these genetic risk scores could be used in future to minimise their genetic risks by making healthier life choices. However, their usefulness at predicting risks when so many other factors are involved remains controversial.“While outstanding questions include whether genetic predisposition to severe obesity can be reduced, these findings should put further pressure on health departments and ministries to recognise obesity as a disease,” said Dr Rishi Caleyachetty, of Warwick Medical School, who was not involved in the study.Professor Tim Frayling of the University of Exeter said spotting people with the most “fat genes” could be particularly helpful in childhood\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspdiet and lifestyle interventions can have the most benefit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s a lot we don’t know about the origins of Easter, and we’re learning more every day.”It is not clear how, when or why the rabbit became linked to the Easter festival, although it could be due to the spread of Christian religious beliefs.The folkloric figure of the Easter Bunny bringing eggs for children is closely linked to German traditions.Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Specimens including the animal’s jaw, portions of its skull, and parts of its skeleton were placed in a drawer at the National Museums of Kenya and not given a great deal of attention until Ohio University researchers Dr Nancy Stevens and Dr Matthew Borths rediscovered them, apparently immediately recognising their significance.Created with Sketch.Insects preserved in amber for millions of years  Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This ant preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis moss twig preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis spider beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis lace bug preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis park-winged fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis click beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis wedge shaped beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThese photos from photographer Levon Biss are for sale in a frame crafted from fossilised Bog Oak that has been preserved underground in peat bogs for 5300 years.The frame contains the actual piece of amber that features in the photographThis ant preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis moss twig preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis spider beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis lace bug preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis park-winged fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis click beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis wedge shaped beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThese photos from photographer Levon Biss are for sale in a frame crafted from fossilised Bog Oak that has been preserved underground in peat bogs for 5300 years.The frame contains the actual piece of amber that features in the photograph“Opening a museum drawer, we saw a row of gigantic meat-eating teeth, clearly belonging to a species new to science,” lead author of the study, Dr Borths said. The research team calculated the species would have weighed up to 1.5 metric tonnes, and could have fed on elephant-like creatures.“Based on its massive teeth, Simbakubwa was a specialised hyper-carnivore that was significantly larger than the modern lion and possibly larger than a polar bear,” he told AFP.The species comes from a group known as the hyaenodonts, which were the first mammalian carnivores in Africa, and lived around 22 million years ago.For about 45 million years after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, hyaenodonts were the apex predators on the continent. But after millions of years of near-isolation, tectonic movements of the Earth’s plates connected Africa with the northern continents, allowing floral and faunal exchange between landmasses. Tiny T rex: Ancestor to the king of the dinosaurs discoveredMassive asteroid will pass Earth closer than the MoonEndangered hen harriers ‘being wiped out by illegal killing’Ice ages ‘triggered by massive collisions at Earth’s equator’Around the time of Simbakubwa, the relatives of cats, hyenas, and dogs began to arrive in Africa from Eurasia.As the relatives of cats and dogs were going south, the relatives of Simbakubwa were going north. “It’s a fascinating time in biological history,” Dr Borths said. “Lineages that had never encountered each other begin to appear together in the fossil record.”The second part of the new species’ name, kutokaafrika, is Swahili for “coming from Africa” because Simbakubwa is the oldest of the gigantic hyaenodonts, suggesting this lineage of giant carnivores originated on the African continent and slowly moved northward to flourish for millions of years.But despite the species longevity, hyaenodonts eventually went extinct across the world. As global ecosystems changed between 18 and 15 million years ago with grasslands replacing forests, new mammalian lineages ersified.“We don’t know exactly what drove hyaenodonts to extinction, but ecosystems were changing quickly as the global climate became drier. The gigantic relatives of Simbakubwa were among the last hyaenodonts on the planet,” Dr Borths said.Dr Stevens, who co-authored the study, said: “This is a pivotal fossil, demonstrating the significance of museum collections for understanding evolutionary history.” “Simbakubwa is a window into a bygone era. As ecosystems shifted, a key predator disappeared, heralding Cenozoic (most recent) faunal transitions that eventually led to the evolution of the modern African fauna.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalThe Blood Moon, for example, appears red in the sky due to something called Raleigh scattering.This occurs when sunlight passes through the Earth\u0027s atmosphere and is the same effect that causes sunsets to appear red.When Friday\u0027s full moon appears above the horizon, Rayleigh scattering will cause the moon to appear orange to observers on the ground. The higher in the sky it rises, the lighter it appears.\u0026nbspMassive asteroid will pass Earth closer than the MoonThe moon also appears larger to terrestrial observers when it is close to the horizon thanks to the moon illusion.The reason for this optical illusion is still a matter of debate, though one of the most common theories is that the moon\u0027s relative size to buildings, trees and other objects on the horizon makes it appear bigger than when it is high in the sky and surrounded by the vastness of space.Another celestial event is also set to take place on Thursday, with Asteroid 2019 GC6 set to pass the Earth on Thursday at half the distance to the Moon.Unfortunately for anyone hoping to spot it, astronomers have described it as trying to spot a lump of coal in the night sky.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were believed to have suffered extreme thirst, low blood pressure and irregular heartbeat causing death if “humane termination” was not carried out.At Liverpool University 18 rabbits had bacteria injected into their spines every other day for 10 days to induce fungal disease. Some died prematurely.At University College London researchers carried out “traumatic” eye surgery, injecting drugs into rabbits’ eyes and sewing them shut. Six rabbits were operated on for eye implants and left for a month before being killed.Sheffield University led on a study in India in which synthetic membranes were glued to one eye of 14 rabbits and the eye sewn shut. Ten animals were left with ocular lesions and eye congestion. “These rabbits would like have felt severe pain and burning to their eyes while confined to their barren metal cage or worse, restraining stocks,” AJP reportedAt Leicester University at least 64 rabbits were killed in an experiment funded by the British Heart Foundation. In multiple experiments by Kings College London rabbits’ heart arteries were injured before they were fed high-fat diets so researchers could investigate plaque build-upDurham University used 264 rabbits, Leicester used 68, Sheffield 59 and Nottingham 40, according to\u0026nbspAJP, which also claimed that\u0026nbspLiverpool University refused to answer a freedom of\u0026nbspinformation (FOI)\u0026nbsprequest but told a member of the public it used 122 rabbits.Latest government figures show that 9,498 rabbits were used in labs in 2017, and AJP said more than half of all animal experiments take place at universities.Created with Sketch.Shocking conditions on rabbit farm in Europe Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115 A rabbit lies at the bottom of a cage, surrounded by feces215 Rabbit cages hover above excrement on breeding farm315 Rabbit in a breeding cage415 Baby rabbit born on industrial breeding farm515 Rabbits in breeding cages615 Rabbits in breeding cages715 Baby rabbits born on industrial breeding farm815 Spray painted rabbit confined in a breeding cage915 Rabbits in breeding cages1015 Excrement below rabbit cages on industrial farm1115 Rabbit with face injury1215 Rabbits and young in breeding cages1315 Rabbits in breeding cages1415 Rabbits in cages hover above excrement on breeding farm1515 Dead rabbits piled and bagged in a bin115 A rabbit lies at the bottom of a cage, surrounded by feces215 Rabbit cages hover above excrement on breeding farm315 Rabbit in a breeding cage415 Baby rabbit born on industrial breeding farm515 Rabbits in breeding cages615 Rabbits in breeding cages715 Baby rabbits born on industrial breeding farm815 Spray painted rabbit confined in a breeding cage915 Rabbits in breeding cages1015 Excrement below rabbit cages on industrial farm1115 Rabbit with face injury1215 Rabbits and young in breeding cages1315 Rabbits in breeding cages1415 Rabbits in cages hover above excrement on breeding farm1515 Dead rabbits piled and bagged in a binThe group, which asks them all each year through FOI\u0026nbsplaws about animals used in research, said this year numbers of institutions being open almost halved, from 46-57 usually to 29 out of 70.The number refusing almost quadrupled, from 5 to 19, many promising to put details online.Brexit ‘could trigger surge in animal testing’ as EU rules invalidatedAJP said a replacement test for rabbits had been accepted by regulators since 2010 but its use was not compulsory by law.Claire Palmer, group founder, said: “Animal experiments like those we have uncovered will be unpalatable to many. Rabbits are a much-loved animal who some share their home with.\u0026nbspDisturbingly, universities just won’t tell us what is happening to them.“They refuse to make information public when asked, but get round it by saying they will put figures online.”Campaigners staged a “die-in” at\u0026nbspNottingham University, with members dressed as the White Rabbit from Alice In Wonderland. A similar protest is planned at the University of Liverpool on Good Friday.Speaking on behalf of the universities,\u0026nbspWendy Jarrett, chief executive of Understanding Animal Research, denied they were being secretive.Campaigners call for ban on ‘cruel’ cages for 350m farm animalsShe said: “Since the publication of the Concordat on Openness on Animal Research in the UK in 2014, organisations that carry out, fund or support research using animals have been increasingly transparent about their animal research.\u0026nbspUK universities in particular are very open about the research they carry out using animals, with most providing facts, figures, case studies and photos on their websites.“The AJP’s own figures show that of the 62 universities they contacted this year, 29 provided the information requested and 31 said that they would publish the information on their websites. It is hard to see how AJP can say these universities are being secretive.\u0026nbspA few UK universities use rabbits in research, but rabbits overall make up 0.3 per cent of the animal research in this country, and only a quarter of that takes place in universities.“If alternatives to animal research are available and have been validated by regulators, it is illegal to use an animal and the research will not receive a licence from the Home Office.\u0026nbspSo rabbits are only used for safety testing, for instance to check that a vaccine will not cause fever in babies and children, when there is no non-animal alternative available.”University tests on all animals in 2017University of Edinburgh: 225,366University of Cambridge:\u0026nbsp157,975University of Manchester:\u0026nbsp104,863University of Sheffield: 83,299University of Newcastle: 53,158University of Cardiff: 46,728University of Glasgow: 46,045University of Birmingham: 45,361University of Dundee: 33,110University of Exeter: 27,237University of Nottingham: 25,248University of Leeds: 22,725University of Aberdeen: 15,268University of East Anglia: 11,082University of Stirling: 9,209University of Liverpool: 8,396A Nottingham University\u0026nbspspokesman said: “Animal studies are still important where animal-free models cannot mimic the sheer complexity of the body.\u0026nbsp“The cholera study was undertaken for the World Health Organization and government of India to develop treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. Demonstrating it worked successfully in rabbits was a vital step towards a new cure for a disease which affects millions of the poorest people worldwide.“We proactively publish all details of our animal testing programme on our public webpages and respond to all Freedom of Information requests.”An Oxford University spokeswoman said they refuse Freedom of Information requests only on data already due for release.“The university also releases all animal testing data, by species and severity, every single year. This is usually in the autumn,” she added.A Liverpool spokeswoman said its work had led to new drugs being approved, adding: “The university uses rabbits in research to help develop new antimicrobial agents for babies, children and adults for diseases that currently have few, if any, treatment options. Rabbit models are used to identify safe and effective dosages of new drugs that can then be studied in clinical trials.”\u0026nbspA Sheffield spokesperson said its\u0026nbspresearch contributed\u0026nbspto groundbreaking developments in treating major diseases, and\u0026nbspit was committed to replacing animals.”However, we are not yet at the point where these techniques can entirely replace the need for animals in research.”A spokeswoman for UCL said it was very open on the animal research it does and its commitment to use alternative techniques where possible.\u0026nbsp“Practically all the drugs available today have been discovered or developed due to animal research, and we would not have vaccines, cancer drugs, blood pressure medication, insulin, or inhalers without this work. Research using animals continues to be necessary,” she said.\u0026nbspThe Independent has also contacted Leicester and Kings College London for comment.\u0026nbspFreedom of InformationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She has since been caring full-time for her two children, one of whom has severe autism.In October 2018, the US national travelled to America for two weeks due to the father being ill. On her return, she was told she had no right to enter, and days later\u0026nbspshe received a notice from the Home Office stating that there was a ticket booked for her removal the following Thursday morning.Speaking to The Independent, Ms Cullen said: “I was just panicking because I couldn’t even\u0026nbspcontact a barrister over the weekend. My children would’ve gone into care because my husband was out of the country at the time. I was living like there was no tomorrow. It felt like everything was falling apart.“They said that if I didn’t board the flight I’d be arrested where I lived and forcibly removed. We were making preparations with social services and school. My children would have been devastated. This is the life that they know.”Ms Cullen’s barrister Morgan Read successfully sought an emergency injunction on the grounds that the department had failed to consider the welfare of her children\u0026nbspin breach of UK law.Despite this, and the fact that she\u0026nbspwas granted a British residence card in January, Ms Cullen is still on immigration bail, and the Home Office still has her passport.\u0026nbsp“I felt like I was finally getting over it, that the judge said I could stay. It just doesn’t make sense. They’ve agreed that I do have the right to be here. It’s like I’m allowed to be here but not allowed to leave,“\u0026nbspsaid Ms Cullen. “It’s baffling really that they don’t seem to consider any human part of this. I feel like I’m just a number. They wanted to protect the border by tearing a mother from her children.“My mother is starting to forget who I am because I’m not there. I just feel lost. This time is precious and they’re taking that from me.”Ms Cullen’s solicitor Arta Heath, managing director of MyUKVisas, said the Home Office’s attempt to deport the mother-of-two\u0026nbspwas “absolutely outrageous”.She said the\u0026nbsppassport issue was a\u0026nbspsymptom of both the hostile environment and “complete incompetence” in the department.Most immigration removals cancelled amid ‘dearth of legal advice’“This is a terrible situation. The Home Office said it knew she had British citizen children but that they could stay with their father, which is absolutely outrageous. They claimed that because had spent two weeks without their mum they could be without her forever,” said Ms Heath.“But the issue now is the administrative process.\u0026nbspThere is no reason for them to hold onto her passport, but they haven’t sent it to her and the removal direction process is still continuing, meaning she can’t go see her mum.“It shows how the inability of the Home Office to understand law and procedure, coupled with the hostile environment, is leading to shocking decisions being made.”Responding to the case, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “It seems the Home Office have ignored what is humane and sensible. Instead they have continued with the tick-box exercises, which have characterised this Tory government’s hostile environment.\u0026nbsp“Until these dreadful policies end, families will live with the threat of being torn apart.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British actress Emma Thompson gives an address from the stage atop the pink boat to climate change activists occupying the road junction at Oxford Circus in central London during the fifth day of environmental protests by the Extinction Rebellion groupA burning car in Creggan, Londonderry after petrol bombs were thrown at police.

Goods bought from European countries will also have risen in cost because of the fall in the value of the pound,\u0026nbspmeaning the real figure is likely to be much higher.Companies appear to have borne the brunt of the price increases, with £4.4bn of the £15bn\u0026nbspin additional costs having been spent on machine and transport equipment. A further £2.9bn more was spent on mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials and £924m went on chemicals and related products.The analysis is based on data published by the government last week.

But if there were any weakening of the Good Friday accords there would be no chance whatsoever, a non-starter for a US-UK trade agreement.“The Good Friday accords ended 700 years of conflict. This is not a treaty only, it’s an ideal, it’s a value, it’s something that’s a model to the world, something that we all take pride in.“It was a model and other people have used it as a model and we don’t want that model to be something that can be bargained away in another agreement.”Created with Sketch.

Speaking in Davos in January, Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar also pointed out that the UK could struggle to negotiate free trade deals elsewhere around the world if the Irish border question remained unresolved.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs.

Any blaze has destructive power. Yet the Notre Dame disaster leaves a greater sense of obliteration. Just look at the crowds of Parisians, many of them youngsters, who wept and clutched one another and sang mournful hymns as they watched Monday’s devastation.Their grief, and the awed horror of countless millions around the world who saw events unfold on TV, was not the normal reaction of onlookers rubber-necking at an accident. The loss of that old building left a deeper anguish. Why James Mates, reporting for ITV’s News At Ten that night, proved his value when he reached for an explanation.“Our time here is brief,” said Mates. “These structures — the greatest creations of mankind — are supposed to be permanent. Few can have imagined seeing one destroyed before our eyes.”These were good words. Notre Dame dates to the th and th centuries. To stand beside such an edice reminds us of our human smallness.The great cathedrals of Western Europe took centuries to build. Beside such projects, the longest human le feels butterfly-short. You run a hand over the old stones of a place like Notre Dame and you are struck by a sense of your own impermanence.You don’t have to be churchy to feel this way. There are other forces at work in our Notre Dame agony, emotions that a modern broadcaster might hesitate to mention. Notre Dame contained more than altars and crosses and pews.Its walls sheltered things far greater than the priceless artworks which burned. Notre Dame was a repository of the concepts of civilisation and nationhood and beauty and Christianity.It may be politically incorrect to say so but Monday’s fire, to many of us, felt like a metaphor for the recent conflagration of those precious moral concepts. French president Emmanuel Macron, who rushed to the scene, had this to say: “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives.”Macron announced a national project to rebuild the cathedral because, “it is our profound destiny”. All this was noble and fair. But measure it against the record of the liberal political class he embodies. The Macrons and Merkels of this world — like the Blairs and Camerons and Cleggs and so many other equivocating cultural cowards — have long preached secularisation. They have diluted Christian values in our laws and public le.One recent Archbishop of Canterbury even told us it might be a good idea to have sharia law in Britain.These political leaders have imposed education systems that fail to teach youngsters to be proud of Western art and religion. They have scoffed at national pride and national flagsand lied to us about the federal element of the European Union.Out of sheer political dogma, post-war politicians bigged up modernist architecture, even though the public hated it. Much-loved vistas were destroyed and our capital cities’ skylines were wrecked when mayors approved show-off skyscrapers.We were told to be ashamed of past national historical triumphs such as the British Empire, which was allegedly racist and supremacist. Tradition was bad. Dferent was good. How come such leaders appreciate antiquity and the values represented by a great cathedral such as Notre Dame only when it has gone up in smoke One of the defining images of the Second World War was that photograph of St Paul’s Cathedral at the height of the Blitz, the dome standing proud amid Hitler’s bombs. The picture captured an idea of British defiance, of our country’s decency withstanding a Nazi dictator’s barbarism. It still makes one’s neck prickle with patriotism.What will we in future feel when we see that image of Notre Dame ablaze on Monday night  Might it come to represent the torching of Christendom in Europe It is said that the Paris fire brigade was slow out of the traps. Might that be a metaphor for a wider carelessness by politicians who have seen our culture in peril and failed to act It is no great secret that churches in France and other continental countries have been in a spiral of neglect for decades. A few years ago I visited a major church in Coutances, northern France, and found dead pigeons on the floor and broken panes in the windows.We have done better in Britain where, despite financial problems, our cathedrals and parish churches continue to be a great glory. The Church of England gets plenty of things wrong but it deserves credit for this.That Notre Dame and some of her treasures have been destroyed in Holy Week, as though roasted in the very fires of Hell, is a challenge to our already-dented morale. It seems cruel and may leave churchgoers agape as they try to identy the Almighty’s purpose.If God is working his purpose out, He has an odd way of going about it.But Easter is about renewal. Maybe that should be our pointer.Let this ghastly fire act as a spark to our resolve to relight a sense of pride in Europe’s Christian tradition.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They said: “She’s our little fighter.”Tiny tot Isabella weighed the same as a Coke can at birth — with hands smaller than p coins.At oz she was the smallest premature baby for  years.Her body was shorter than a pack of baby wipes and doctors put her in bubble wrap to keep her warm.Yet after several scares and two le-saving ops she left hospital after six months and is now beaming at home with parents Kym Brown, , and Ryan Evans, .Relieved Kym said: “Realistically she shouldn’t be here. There were so many times we could have lost her.“But she never stops fighting. We love her to bits. She’s perfect.”Kym joked: “We are going to wrap her in bubble wrap for the rest of her le!” Restaurant manager Kym had been due to give birth on September .But at  weeks her ankles started to swell, with no one at that stage realising it was due to pre-eclampsia, a ­condition which affects six per cent of pregnancies and can be fatal for mother and baby.Kym went to her local hospital in Gloucester where a scan showed Isabella had stopped growing at  weeks. Staff hoped the pregnancy could continue for a fortnight and transferred Kym to Southmead Hospital in Bristol as a precaution.A scan the next day revealed Isabella’s heart rate was dropping so Kym was rushed in for a caesarean.She said: “It sounds dramatic and scary now but at the time I was quite calm. I didn’t have time for it to sink in.It was worse for Ryan because he could see how fast things were moving and how ill I was getting. He thought he was going to lose us both.”Isabella was born on June  at  weeks. She was put in an incubator to help her breathe.Kym waited a week to hold her in blankets and a fortnight for their first skin-to-skin cuddle.She said: “It was love at first sight and the protective maternal instinct kicks in. I stayed with her every night she was in hospital.“She couldn’t feed or breathe at first so she had tubes for that.“A few times she knocked out her breathing tube and the nurses had to grab her off me and fit another as quick as they could.”At three weeks the couple learned Isabella had a hole in her bowel and would need surgery at another hospital, St Michael’s. Kym said: “We prepared ourselves for the worst so when we got the call to say the op had gone well I just said, ‘OK’. I was in shock.“The way I was coping was to expect the worst. When the good news arrived I couldn’t take it in.”Three months later Isabella needed a second bowel op. Again she pulled through. She also needed laser eye surgery at a few months old.Kym added: “She wore her first vest at three months and only then because we think it had shrunk in the wash at the hospital.The vest was smaller than my phone.”But what is remarkable is that any baby born weighing under ozhas a quite low likelihood of pulling through.For a baby weighing g to survive is extraordinary. The odds would be around one in .Being born so premature means the lungs and brain have not yet had a chance to fully develop. So there is a chance of chronic lung and developmental problems later in le.We know the goalposts are shting but we need research to better understand and prevent these very early deliveries.Even a week longer in the womb has a huge impact on survival.At four months Isabella could finally fit premature baby clothes.And on December  she was allowed to go home to Bishop’s Cleeve, Gloucs.Ryan, a chef, said: “That was one of the best feelings in the world.”Now aged ten months Isabella weighs around the same as a newborn at lb.Ryan added: “She’s being weaned off her oxygen support and is expected to make a full recovery.“We’ve just had a catch-up with her consultant and he was amazed with her progress.”Kym said: “She has a hernia and a hole in the heart but they are just monitoring those and hope they will put themselves right.“We can’t thank the doctors and nurses enough at all the hospitals. They are superheroes.”Isabella tipped the scales at g .

This letter to the people of the UK was written in a police cell, where I was held for six hours.The information is from my memory, having spent the past  years following climate science. I have never been an activist, nor have I been arrested before.I came to London to join the Extinction Rebellion and was camping at Marble Arch and protesting at multiple London sites until my arrest on Wednesday afternoon.The Extinction Rebellion aims are: For the Government to tell the truth about climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by  and to form a Citizens Assembly to determine how we achieve this.Preventing climate catastrophe is the most important political, social, environmental and technical problem humanity has ever faced.The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Changeis the United Nations body which assesses all available science related to climate change. It suggests a number of routes to limiting the rise in global average temperatures to .C. It also tells us that an increase of C will have much worse effects.All pathways to a maximum .C rise require cuts of around  per cent in global emissions within about  years. To have any chance of achieving this, we need to take immediate action to drastically reduce emissions.So far we have caused global average temperatures to increase by .C since the end of the s. We are already seeing the spread of wildfires, hurricanes, drought, melting icecaps, sea levels rising, ocean acidication, coral reef die-off and the largest scale extinction of animal and plant species since the end of the dinosaurs.The IPCC is predicting C to C of warming based on our current trajectory. With these changes, the Earth will not look like the one we recognise today, but rather like the planet of million years ago. Then there was no ice, temperatures were inhospitable and sea levels much higher — dferences that would totally destabilise ecosystems and society.As climate change continues, human-induced effects are amplied by earth processes, such as methane from melting permafrost and reduced reflection of light back in to space as polar ice sheets shrink. These processes will make global heating worse and are sometimes called tipping points, as they can lead to runaway climate change where the human effects are no longer the main drivers — and they are impossible to halt.Since human climate change was first predicted by Swedish physicist Arrhenius in , thousands of scientists, working for decades in dozens of countries and disciplines, have come to a consensus that climate change is real and the effects catastrophic. There is no scientic debate to be had.The Government is complacent about the UK’s emission reductions, while failing to meet its own targets.Given the situation, I feel the Extinction Rebellion is our last best shot at getting governments to listen and start telling the truth.Once the truth is being told I believe that YOU will be urging the Government to act fast and vote accordingly.My involvement in the rebellion and my arrest are my heartfelt attempt to do whatever I can to help prevent the worst effects of climate change and the social, environmental and financial costs it will cause.I am sorry for the disruption caused to local businesses and commuters.I also apologise to the politan Police for the ersion of resources. My experience of the Met is that there has been an atmosphere of mutual respect between them and protesters.I ask that you, the people, become properly informed about climate change. I also ask that Government, businesses and public bodies start taking transformative action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero.Finally, I ask for a Citizens Assembly, a representative group of the population which will determine the direction we take to get to zero carbon and will take decisions out of the electoral cycle and political and financial influence.The protesters in London represent a broad church of opinion but I would say my opinions and background are typical.If you have read this far, thank you very much.PIERS writes his letter from a police cell – and for that reason, I cannot take him seriously. He and his fellow protesters might think their cause is noble, but breaking the law is not.Equality before the law is one of the most important principles of British justice. The expectation has always been thatyou commit a crime, you will do the time.Yet for days now, parts of central London have been overrun by a rag-tag band of climate change activists, Piers among them.Setting up makesht camps at Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, members of Extinction Rebellion have blockaded roads. And they appeared to be doing so with the support of the politan Police and the force’s boss, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.Their cause is an important one, but like every good hostage taker, Extinction Rebellion has come armed with a list of demands, and protesters are prepared to be arrested to secure them. Yet even Extinction Rebellion must have been surprised the blockades were not removed for four days.Hundreds of thousands of Londoners have been suffering on a daily basis. Commuters cannot get to work as buses have been erted. Shoppers have had to abandon some of the busiest streets. Businesses can’t get essential supplies. Emergency vehicles are unable to take the quickest routes. The blockades have cost London millions.Nobody denies the activists are committing a crime by obstructing the streets. Until yesterday, police could be found helping them by acting as picket-line cheerleaders and traffic controllers. We have been told the police presence hasn’t detracted from usual police business. Which of us believes that Excusing their behaviour because it is an important and righteous cause ignores the problem that we are setting a precedent.The liberal, metropolitan elite cheering on the protesters should be careful what they wish for. Paris has been convulsed by violent protests that began in a similar way. Failure to apply the law of obstruction when the Yellow Vest movement started has cost France dear.Others with cause to be angry about politics will have learned the lessons from Extinction Rebellion’s successful action.Remain-backing Londoners may feel very dferently about the taking over of public spaceLeave supporters annoyed at the failure to secure Brexit hit the streets in peaceful protest. But they will have only themselves to blame. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was expelled when Corbyn was leader for rather delightfully tweeting: “Dan Jarvis can lick my f***ing ar*e too. Posing c***.”A shame no one was on top of that detail, as I thought it would’ve added to the debate they were having about “male aggression” ruining politics.No matter, because this week we had a discussion on feminism and the open goal of Frankie Boyle asking“the biggest problem for women is the determination of some men to be objectionable”.It is, Frankie. It is.As he well knew, though, there was fat chance of any of his guests being brave or bright enough to point out there was a big problem sat right in front of them.They all live in a wilfully blind, hypocritical political universe and will ignore any personal and professional failings, no matter how obvious and odious, just so long as the person shares the same common enemy and goals as the rest of this toxic, left-wing BBC bubble.Althoughcolumnist and environmentalist George Monbiot did rather let the cat out of the bag with that end- of-show rant.“We’ve got to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it. But you said this was going to be a comedy programme, Frankie.”Oh George, how stupid and naive can you really be QVC, Katy Pullinger to Michelle Mone: “I can’t wait to see your wedding photos.” Britain’s Got Talent, David Walliams: “Sheila Simmonds, you are a very funny lady.” And Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, Jeff Brazier: “I think I might surprise a few people with who I really am.”Not unless you’re really Kirk Douglas you won’t.CHANNEL ’s three-part series Let’s Talk About Sex is a perfect example of a good idea gone bad.For it’s one thing holding up old sex education films for well-deserved ridicule.

Fiona Bruce and political pundit Isabel Oakeshott said Labour was behind in the polls – but in the last  at the time it has trailed the Tories in four, led in four and tied in two. Correcting the claim on the show, Ms Abbott said: “Just as a point of information, currently we’re kind of, in the polls overall, we’re kind of level pegging”. But Ms Bruce interjected “But you’re behind, Diane…Definitely”.    On a subsequent episode, Ms Bruce claried her comments. She said: I was talking about a poll that came out on the day of the programme which suggested the Conservatives were ahead.The Shadow Home Secretary mentioned some other earlier polls that showed Labour in the lead.We should have made that context clear and Iaposm really happy to do that now. But after more than a dozen complaints from members of the public, the BBCaposs Executive Complaints Unit have admitted the correction didnapost go far enough.   In a ruling published this week, the Corporation said: Subsequent corrections on social media and on the BBC website “Corrections and Clarications” page made clear that Ms Bruce had in mind a poll published on the morning of the programme which showed a Conservative lead , while saying Ms Abbott was  “also right”  with reference to recent polling as a whole, and a correction by Ms Bruce in the  January edition of the programme echoed this. The ECU, while acknowledging these extensive efforts to set the record straight, took the view that the effect of Ms Bruce’s intervention went beyond generating confusion between dferent sets of polling data, suggesting that, contrary to what Ms Abbott had said, the overall data then current showed a definite Conservative lead, and that the corrections did not entirely recty that impression. But the broadcaster said they found no evidence to back up claims that Ms Abbott was treated unfairly in the warm-up to the show, where Ms Abbott claimed the audience were wound up against her. The Broadcaster said: The ECU found no grounds for the suggestion that the presenter, Fiona Bruce, had referred to Ms Abbott during the preliminaries to the recording in terms which were discriminatory or likely to prejudice the studio audience against her, and nothing to support the view that Ms Bruce’s conduct of the discussion was less than even-handed.

Andy Walkden, who had  years experience, can be seen gliding above the coast near Southport.The picture was taken at .pm on Thursday April . A minute later the first  calls were made about the crash near Royal Birkdale Golf Course, reports the Liverpool Echo.His daughter, Kayleigh Worthington, said that seeing her dad looking so at home in the sky was a comfort. She said: Someone came to me and sent me a picture of him at .pm, the reports said at pm it was reported. This picture may be seconds or minutes before it happened. It all looks perfectly fine, it’s nice to seem he’s going into the sunset, that’s quite comforting.    Mr Walkdenaposs paramotor crashed into the ground close to Royal Birkdale Gold Course before bursting into flames. Fire crews, paramedics and police officers were seen at the crash sight with witnesses reporting seeing smoke coming from the area. The accident was initially reported as a microlight aircraft accident but was later confirmed to be a paramotor. Mr Walkden has not been formally identied by police yet due to the severity of the injuries he sustained in the crash.    Earlier this week his daughter, Kayleigh and son Aaron took to social media to share the news that their dad was the pilot involved in the crash.Kayleigh posted on Facebook: I just want to confirm that the person who lost his le is my dad Andy Walkden. I still feel like I’m in a dream and this isn’t happening.He still hasn’t been fully identied because of the severity of the incident but we know it is him. I just wanted to thank everyone for their messages, I’m sorry I haven’t replied to you all personally, I just haven’t had it in me until now. He was only  years old which is what I am struggling to come to terms with, he was such a skilled pilot and instructor and taught many people to fly over the years. He knew my thoughts on him doing this, and how I felt when he recently got the passion back and started up again, but it’s what he loved, which is what I’m trying to focus on to get me through this horrendous time in my le.    Aaron also posted a short message confirming the heartbreaking news and thanking people for their support. He wrote: I just wanted to thank everyone for your messages and I will let you all no when and were the funeral will be taking place. A paramotor is a motorised, steerable parachute that is powered by a motor and a propeller that is strapped to the pilotaposs back. Unlike a micro-light aircraft, a paramotor does not require a licence or any formal pilot training. The paramotor aircraft or its pilot also do not need insurance or to be registered. After the initial report that stated that the aircraft was a micro-light, all micro-light pilots in the area were accounted for.

From the more recent spy poisoning in the Salisbury to the  arrest of alleged Russian spies in New York. Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned to death in  and the former KGB man accused Russian authorities of ordering the assassination. This year, the KGBaposs secret spy Melita Norwood is back in the news with the release of Red Joan, a film inspired by her story. But thataposs not all, here we look at more shocking revelations that show how the Russian security service has placed spies at the heart of British and US le since the Soviet Union was created. Melita Norwood  In  a frail elderly woman was exposed as having been a spy for  years. Melita Norwood lived a quiet le at her suburban home in Bexleyheath, South London, and enjoyed making chutney and tending to her garden.But the unassuming white-haired old lady was really Agent Hola who had been recruited in . She passed secrets from her work with the Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association - a cover for Britainaposs top secret nuclear programme - including the plans for our atomic bomb. Melita said: I did what I did not to make money but to help prevent the defeat of a new system which had, at great cost, given ordinary people food and fares which they could afford, a good education and a health service. Her story has now been made into a book and a film called Red Joan - it takes a bit of artistic licence with her tale. The true story was far less romantic and more shocking. The Cambridge Five  The most extensive and dangerous network ever uncovered was the Cambridge Five.Recruited at the cityaposs university, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Kim Philby worked their way into the heart of the establishment - while passing secrets to their Russian bosses. The identity of the fth Cambridge spy has never been revealed. Thousands of confidential documents made their way to Moscow. But in  - as the net closed in on Burgess and Maclean - they were tipped off by Philby, who had been the head of British intelligenceaposs counter espionage unit. The pair disappeared, surfacing five years later in Moscow. It took years before the roles of all five were revealed and decades more for the British security services to fully recover. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg  In America Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in  for passing atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union.They were communists but insisted they were innocent. The couple were convicted on the evidence of Ethelaposs brother, David Greenglass, who admitted spying but was spared execution infor testying against them. He had worked on the American nuclear programme and said his sister typed up secrets which were passed to the KGB. But he later admitted he lied to save his own le. In , Greenglass, who spent  years in jail, said: I would not sacrice my we and my children for my sister. Every time I am haunted by it, my we says aposLook, we are still aliveapos. George Blake  After fighting the Nazis with the Dutch Underground during the Second World War, George Blake then joined the Special Operations Executive - the precursor of MI.He was captured and imprisoned by communist forces during the Korean War and ed home a hero when released in . Blake was then sent to work in West Berlin where he was ordered to recruit Soviet officers as double agents - but he became a double agent himself. During his nine-year posting, he betrayed  MI agents to the KGB. But a defector then betrayed him and he was sentenced to  years in prison. In  he managed to escape from Wormwood Scrubs in London and fled to the USSR. By , there were estimated to be  Russian intelligence officers in Britain who were working from the Soviet Embassy. And a host of seemingly respectable establishment figures were revealed to be spies.    The Act up our Sleeves Suave Sidney Reilly, aka the Ace of Spies, was our first spy in Russia - and a possible inspiration for James Bond.Born in  in Russia, he was named as a revolutionary and fled to London after faking his own death. After adopting a new identity and passport, he wangled his way into British high society and frequented the best casinos. Then he ed to Russia, to spy for Britain and Japan. His exploits included strangling a foreman who caught him stealing weapons plans. He posed as a pilot at the Frankfurt Airshow and took a sophisticated generator from a German plane. And he seduced the we of a Russian minister to get info about German weapons shipments. In  he plotted to assassinate Lenin, but was betrayed. In , he was shot and killed. His legend was complete when Reilly, Ace of Spies became an s TV hit.Georgi Markov    Bulgarian Georgi Markov defected to the West in  and quickly became a critic of his countryaposs Communist regime.As he crossed Waterloo Bridge in London in , he was jabbed with an umbrella by a passer-by. The poison ricin had been injected into his leg and he died four days later aged . Dead Drop is very much alive The dead letter drop was the favourite way for spies to pass microfilm or letters to handlers.A crack in a wall or a hole in a tree would be used and a secret signal would indicate that an item was ready for collection. Aldrich Ames left chalk marks on a mail box in Washington DC to let Russian handlers know he had left a package inside. Today, technology provides a modern equivalent. Spies can open an email account, pass on the log-in details and save an email as a draft for anyone in the cell to see. By not sending it they evade the sophisticated computers that search millions of emails in the blink of an eye. There are even electronic dead letter boxes. Years ago the FSB accused British spies of concealing hi-tech devices inside hollowed out rocks. The Brits would pause by one of the rocks and transmit data wirelessly or by bluetooth from a phone or PDA to the rock. In New York, court papers show the alleged spies and their handlers passed information electronically through innocent looking brush by encounters. Messages were also sent via secret online networks as they surfed the web in bookstores.

The blockage, caused by people pouring concrete into drains, is the largest that water company Thames Water has ever seen. Over time it has built up to become at least  metres long and weighing  tonnes. Residents have been told the aposconcretebergapos will take at least two months to remove with pneumatic drills and high pressure jets, with work beginning next week. Tankers will be kept on standby to pump out any backed-up sewage blocked by the concrete, Thames Water said.    The solidied concrete is more dense than a so-called aposfatbergapos, made up of fat, oil and wet wipes, and has set to the walls of the Victorian-era sewer. Blockages cost Thames Water, the company that supplies water to London and the Thames Valley, around £million each year. The concrete under Hall Street in Islington alone is expected to cost several hundred thousand pounds to clear. Alex Saunders, Thames Water operations manager, said: Normally blockages are caused by fat, oil and wet wipes building up in the sewer, but unfortunately in this case itaposs rock-hard concrete.    Itaposs in there and set to the Victorian brickwork, so we need to chip away at it to get it removed. This is not the first time damage has been caused by people pouring concrete into our sewers but itaposs certainly the worst weaposve seen. Itaposs very frustrating and takes a great amount of time and effort to resolve. Weaposre now doing everything we can to deal with it as quickly as possible, making sure our customers donapost have to suffer because of this mindless abuse of our network.

Ms McKee, , was caught in crossfire and shot in the head when a gunman fired a number of shots at police in what the force in in Northern Ireland is treating as a terrorist incident. Police have blamed the dissident republican group the New IRA for the journalistaposs murder as petrol bombs, bricks and bottles were hurled at police Land Rovers amid disturbances in Derry on Thursday night. At .pm, about four minutes before she was fatally wounded, Ms McKee posted a photo of the scene with flames and smoke visible in the distance. She wrote: Derry tonight. Absolute madness.    Award-winning Ms McKee, from Belfast, worked as an editor for Calornia-based news site Mediagazer, a trade publication covering the media industry. Her work has been published by The Atlantic, Mosaic Science, BuzzFeed and The Ferret. It is understood she had recently moved to Derry to live with her partner. In , Forbes Magazine named Ms McKee one of their  under  in media.  She had been working on a new book which had been due to be published in . In Thursday nightaposs incident, eyewitnesses claimed a masked figure stopped at the bottom of the road and fired shots up towards where Lyra was standing. People started to run for their lives, and Jake Hanrahan, a journalist who was at the scene, said Ms McKee was caught in crossfire. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, of Police Service Northern Ireland, told reporters on Friday the dissident republican group the New IRA was probably responsible for the murder.  Police Service of Northern Ireland officers were carrying out a search operation in the Creggan area of Derry aimed at disrupting dissident republicans ahead of this weekendaposs commemoration of Irish independence, when a situation developed during which more than  petrol bombs were thrown at officers and two cars were hijacked and set on fire. During the unrest a gunman fired a number of shots at police, Mr Hamilton said. He said: Lyra McKee,  years old, was wounded. She was taken away in a police Land Rover to Altnagelvin Hospital but unfortunately she has died there. We have now launched a murder inquiry here in the city.   We believe this to be a terrorist act, we believe it has been carried out by violent dissident republicans, our assessment at this time is that the New IRA are most likely to be the ones behind this and that forms our primary line of inquiry. This is a horrendous act, it is unnecessary, it is uncalled for, it is totally unjustied. Ms McKee rose to prominence in  after a blog post called Letter to my -year-old self in which she spoke about the struggle of growing up gay in Belfast. In the five years since, her letter was turned into a short film, she became a published author with Angels With Blue Faces, and had recently signed a two-book deal with Faber  Faber, as well as appearing in domestic and international publications.  Named as one of the  under  in media by Forbes Magazine in , Ms McKee was cited for her passion of dig into topics that others donapost care about. Angels With Blue Faces, a non-fiction book about the Troubles-era cold case murder of South Belfast MP Rev Robert Bradford, was released in  and her latest book, The Lost Boys, is due for publication by Faber  Faber next year. The book, which described the author as a rising star of investigative journalism, focuses on the story of Thomas Spence and John Rodgers, who vanished near the Falls Road in west Belfast in November . In an earlier piece about the book, agent Janklow and Nesbit said: Lyra is a -year-old investigative journalist who grew up on Belfastaposs Cltonville Road, just off the infamous Murder Mile, the area which saw more casualties per square foot than any other part of the city during the Troubles.  Lyra is fascinated by the recent history of the city her focus as a journalist is the indirect ways the violence of war plays out, through its secondary waves of victims, and through the way trauma is passed on to subsequent generations. Like Anna Funderaposs Stasiland and Andy OaposHaganaposs The Missing, The Lost Boys will be an investigation, but also a portrait of a place of Belfast and of the Troubles, at the first moment in time where itaposs become possible to write about them historically . Mr Hamilton offered his deepest sympathies to Ms McKeeaposs family. And he said: But not only is it a murder of a young woman, it is an attack again on the people of this city. I stood here in January and we talked about the bomb and the act of violence against this city, and yet again we see another act of violence in this city which has had horrendous consequences and which will affect people for many, many years.  I would appeal to people, particularly this Easter weekend, to stay calm, I would appeal to people who are intent on violence to draw back, I would appeal to people with influence to use your influence and make sure this is peaceful weekend. Not only this weekend but going forward in this city. These acts of violence are bringing nothing to this city, all they are doing is bringing misery to one family, but also particularly to this city and also to our broader province. Grief-stricken friends and fellow journalists have paid tribute to Ms McKee. Matthew Hughes said he had been left devastated by the death of one of his closest friends. I just received the heartbreaking news that my friend @LyraMcKee was murdered tonight in a terrorist incident in Derry, he tweeted.  She was one of my closest friends. She was my mentor. She was a groomswoman at my wedding. I canapost imagine le without her, and yet now I must. Ann Travers, whose sister Mary was murdered by the IRA in , said Ms McKee was a kind, gentle, witty and stubborn soul. I have just heard, that my lovely friend Lyra was murdered tonight in Derry. I just canapost believe, that this witty, clever human being has been taken... Feel sick. Fellow journalist Peter McGuire said Ms McKee was a gted writer, a kind person and SO generous with her time and knowledge. So young - horric  heartbreaking news from Derry tonight, he tweeted.  Seamus Dooley, Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists, wrote: Shocked by news that woman shot dead in Derry last night has been named locally as @NUJofficial Lyra McKee. We are shocked by killing of a journalist of courage, style and integrity. Sympathy to her partner, family and many friends. Lilly Dancyger, a New York-based editor at digital publication Narratively, said Ms McKee was dedicated to covering the lasting trauma  violence of the Troubles. Devastating to hear she was killed tonight by that same violence, she tweeted. Ms Dancyger shared an article written by Ms McKee about the families of Troubles victims. I was Lyraaposs editor on this story, and it was an honour. Sharing her work now is all I can think to do, she said. The Ferret, an online investigative journalism cooperative in Scotland which had published Ms McKeeaposs work, tweeted: We are deeply saddened to hear of Lyra McKeeaposs death. Lyra was a brilliant journalist who wrote for The Ferret. In  she won Scottish Refugee Council and Write to End Violence Against Women awards. Our deepest sympathies go out to Lyraaposs family and friends. Writer Brooke Magnanti, whose blogs were made into TV hit Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, said she was stunned by the news. She tweeted: I only knew her from online and a phone conversations after we were introduced by @GlasgaeLauraLee she struck me as a thoughtful journalist unafraid to challenge her own beliefs. Rare and precious. Deepest condolences to family and friends. Lisa McKee, creator of the hit Channel  programme Derry Girls, tweeted: Sickening, shameful and heartbreaking.

Pilots would reportedly then use the data to calculate exactly how much fuel is needed for the flight and reducing the amount wasted. Other options are believed to include security body scan machines which could record a personaposs weight.    The move is said to also help reduce carbon emissions by using up less fuel. Currently, airlines use an average weight of a man, woman and child to estimate their fuel needs.For men, they allow . stone, for women  stone and for children . stone, reports the Independent .However, Berkshire-based Fuel Matrix reportedly claims this calculation results in fuel wastage. Chief operating officer Nick Brasier told the Independent that most flights carry about one per cent more fuel than they need and burn about . to . per cent more fuel due to the extra fuel weight.     Brasier said: “We’re not suggesting people should stand on the scales, but airports could fit ‘pressure pads’ in the self-service bag drop area in front of each screen. “After the bag has been checked in, the system can ask, ‘Are you standing on the pressure pad ’ “If the passenger taps ‘Yes’, then the weight can be recorded and passed confidentially to the airline.” "},{"url":null,"title":"paul routledge brexit takes across","story":"NewsopinionPaul Routledge: Brexit takes us across the border into a nightmareWhat I saw between Hungary and Serbia two days ago is the spectre haunting Dover and all the Channel portsShareCommentsByPaul Routledge:,  APR NewsopinionIve seen the future Jacob and it doesnt work! \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI have seen the future, and it doesn’t work.

The third girl then emptied her bag, took her belongings out and said to Ms Hampson: aposjust go and donapost involve the policeapos. Ms Hampson went back to the refuge and didnapost report matters to the staff but did tell the police. Her phone was used earlier in the evening by Apsley for her to make some texts. One of the replies to her read: aposWas you proud of me coming all that way to batter that birdapos. This was from Walsh and the Crown believe she was brought in for the assault. There was an element of planning and premeditation. Ms Hampson was a vulnerable person.  Walsh had five previous offences on her criminal record including a public order offence when she threatened a mother and her toddler as they were getting in their car and she said: Iaposm going to f***ing get you. She also had a previous conviction for assault occasional actual bodily harm in  when she got involved in a bar fight where she was seen to possess a kne, which was caught on the bars CCTV. Apsley had  offences on her record including assault whilst drunk. In mitigation Apsleyaposs lawyer Ian Metcalfe said: This was an ugly and repulsive incident and she is aware of that. But there was no evidence on the phone to suggest Miss Apsley summonsed Walsh. The text from Walsh is open to interpretation. Walsh who was unrepresented said: I am anxious and I have had some depression. I live with my son and my mum, my son has ADHD and has got some learning dficulties. My mum is  and struggles with her breathing. I was out my face on drugs when I sent that message. Sentencing Judge Tina Landale told the women: You have both pleaded guilty to assault on a lady who thought she was your friend. You Apsley were out on New Years Eve, you had a good evening, but something went wrong. After you got her back to your flat you borrowed her bank card to get some money out of the cash point to carry on drinking. You came back with Gillian Walsh, you had been using drugs and drinking alcohol. Things turned almost immediately as Walsh punched this lady a number of times and caused her some injuries to her face and her body. She wasnapost allowed to leave and whilst she was on the sofa you, Apsley punched her. These offences are serious. Both women were also made subject of a restraining order for three years, prohibiting contact with Ms Hampson. If you or someone you know is struggling with, there is help available.

Christians believe that Jesus was betrayed by Judas after the Last Supper with his disciples on Maundy Thursday. He was nailed to a cross and crucied on Good Friday, despite the fact that he had done nothing wrong.  Why is it called Good Friday  While it seems strange to describe the day that somebody died as good, in this case it means more holy. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, good designates a day onwhich religious observance is held. The earliest known use of guode friday was in , in a text called The South English Legendary.Good Friday is also sometimes called Holy Friday or Great Friday.What are the Good Friday traditions  Good Friday traditions y around the world, but it is widely observed by Christians as a day of sorrow and mourning. In many countries people reenact Jesusapos walk to his death, with some even choosing to carry a cross on their back.Spain is particularly known for its celebration of aposHoly Weekaposwhich sees numerous processions and parades across the country. The most dramatic of these parades are usually held on Good Friday and Palm Sunday.Why do we eat Hot Cross Buns on Good Friday  There are a few dferent theories as to why people traditionally eat hot cross buns on Good Friday.One story suggests that a monk in the th century was the first to bake the yeasted sweet buns and mark them with a cross in honour of Good Friday.Theyaposre eaten to mark the end of Lent, as they contain the dairy products that were traditionally forbidden during the Christian period of fasting. An old English superstition suggested that hot cross buns baked on Good Friday would never go mouldy or spoil.Why do people eat fish on Good Friday  Many Christians choose to abstain from eating meat on Good Friday, and instead only eat fish. This is because eating meat was associated with feasts and celebration, and the Church felt it was inappropriate for the day that Jesus died.Fish is fine, as it was seen as a more everyday meal. Many people were fishermen, so there was nothing special or celebratory about dining on fish."},{"url":null,"title":"woman abandoned uber driver after","story":"NewsWoman is abandoned by Uber driver after discovering she was going to abortion clinicThe -year-old student was told shed \"regret it\" and was left in the middle of nowhereShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsWoman ordering a taxi ride with mobile app on smartphone in the city\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter falling unexpectedly pregnant, a -year-old student found herself in a distressing situation.Having made the decision to have a termination , the unnamed woman found a clinic an hour away from her university in upstate New York which had appointment availability in three days.

Butcher has added steel in the middle of the park and chipped in with the winner over Championship leaders Ross County last month.  .Mark Connolly: Apps .Another tough tackler and a man with experience of the game up here from spells with St Johnstone and, in particular, Kilmarnock. The -year-old Irishman is a no-nonsense centre-half who’s not slow to let those around him know itthey’re not pulling their weight.  .Morgaro Gomis: Apps .Boss Robbie Neilson made it clear when he handed Gomis a third spell at United via a short-term contract he was being signed as cover. It has been handy to have his experience in reserve but he’s unlikely to be retained for next season.  .Ian Harkes: Apps .The -year-old American has brought energy to the middle of the park and impressed with his box-to-box performances. Son of former USA international John, Harkes was very much a signing for the long term but he has settled quickly.  .Ross Laidlaw: Apps .The keeper was brought in on loan to cover for Benjamin Siegrist after Matej Rakovan asked to be released from his contract. So far he has not been called into action. No mark.Aidan Nesbitt: Apps .The -year-old is on a short-term deal, having worked with the manager at MK Dons. Once a highly-rated Celtic kid, Nesbitt showed promise in his early appearances but his game time has become infrequent.  .Peter Pawlett: Apps .One of the high-profile signings when he moved up from MK Dons, Pawlett was well known to United fans from his time with Aberdeen. While injuries and a lack of game time before he arrived mean it will be next season before the best is seen of him, he’s still shown his quality.  .Mark Reynolds: Apps .Having suffered a serious knee injury last summer, the decision to bring the defender on loan from Aberdeen looked a gamble. Neilson showed his faith in the -year-old by handing him the captaincy and Reynolds has repaid him with a string of top-class displays.  .Charlie Seaman: Apps .Little was known of the -year-old full-back when he arrived on loan from Bournemouth and he came with little first-team experience. At times his form has been patchy but he’s done enough to show why the Premier League outfit rate him.  .Cammy Smith: Apps .Robbie Neilson had to work hard to persuade St Mirren to release Smith and there was talk of the Paisley board blocking the move. Smith had a frustrating loan spell at United when he was an Aberdeen player and his first few months back have followed a similar pattern.  .Osman Sow: Apps .United paid a five-figure fee to MK Dons for the Swede. The injury problems that hit him in down in England have continued and he’s managed only two starts so far. One was against Ayr United last week and he did show some nice touches.  ."},{"url":null,"title":"emirates-a380-inside-luxurious-double-decker-jet-as-it-comes-to-glasgow","story":"THIS is an inside

campaign","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes today admitted he faces his busiest summer transfer window yet to rebuild his team.And McInnes also confirmed he will face a hectic window with “money at a premium” due to the construction of the £ million stadium and training complex.McInnes could have lost as many as  players at the end of the campaign who were with the Dons in January with Pittodrie deals for six players set to expire.Five loan players are also set toto their parent clubs.McInnes confirmed he is in constant dialogue with chairman Stewart Milne and vice-chairman Dave Cormack about securing a host of new signings during the summer transfer window.While having the backing of the board for the rebuild, he accepts the need to use the finances made available wisely.McInnes said: “This will be the busiest summer yet. There is a lot of work to be done as we anticipate losing a lot of key players.“Replacing key players has been a challenge, especially over the last couple of seasons.“We will need to work well and work smart as a club to get in the level of player we need.“There is constant discussion with the chairman and vice-chairman about these matters.“Money is at a premium at the minute as we have a stadium to pay for and a training ground.“We have to make sure we use what money we have wisely.”Aberdeen look set to lose captain Graeme Shinnie with Derby County closing in on signing the Scotland international.The Dons have offered the midfielder a deal that would make him the highest paid at the club and is understood to be for five years, including a testimonial.Shinnie travelled to Derby County last week for talks with Rams boss Frank Lampard. Derby are under a soft transfer embargo as the English Football League investigate their finances.However, it is understood that will be lted – allowing Derby to push through the signing of the Aberdeen captain.McInnes insists there has been no further development with Shinnie regarding Dons talks.Scotland international winger Gary Mackay-Steven is also set to go out of contract and is wanted by MLS side New York City, who made a formal approach to talk to him in the January window.Also out of contract is long-serving defender Andy Considine, who has made enough appearances to trigger a clause in his deal for a one-year extension.However, they have yet to thrash out another contract.Defender Mark Reynolds, on loan at Dundee United, has signed a pre-contract with the Tannadice club.Also with deals expiring are defender Greg Halford and keeper Tomas Cerny.Definitely exiting Pittodrie following the final game against Hibs are loan players James Wilson , Greg Stewart , Dom Balland Max Lowe . Defender Tommie Hobanhas already ed to his parent club having sustained season-ending cruciate ligament damage that required surgery.Stewart will become a free agent in the summer but it is understood he will sign on at Premiership rivals Rangers.Ball’s deal at Rotherham is also set to expire and McInnes has opened talks with the defender on a permanent move to Pittodrie.Hoban is also set to go out of contract at Watford in the summer but the Premier League club will oversee his rehabilitation from surgery. When he is fit – which will be well into next season – andHoban is still available, McInnes has not ruled out moving to sign him.However, the main priority is strengthening this summer with McInnes facing his busiest window in his six years at the club.He said: “We are well aware of what we have to do. We have players going out of contract and players on loan going back so we have a lot to do in the summer.“The first port of call is always the out-of-contract list and free agents, trying to bridge the gap that way.”There will be less than two months from the end of the season to the start of next.Whether the Dons kick-off the - campaign in the Europa League or the League Cup group stages still remains up in the air.Aberdeen face third-placed Kilmarnock tomorrow at Rugby Park. Leading the Dons on goal dference, Killie hold that third spot which brings immediate Europa League qualication.Fourth place will also bring Euro qualication should Celtic beat Hearts to retain the Scottish Cup.Whichever competition the Reds will begin their season in will matter little to their build-up or the time-line for signings.The Europa League first qualying round, which the Dons are in contention to qualy for, begins on Thursday July .

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bank injects tens thousands pounds","story":"NewsBank injects tens of thousands of pounds to revamp Ayrshire branchGiant lodges application with councilShareByStephen Houston:,  APR NewsAyr High Street branch, Bank Of Scotland\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMajor investment is being made to spruce up the Bank of Scotland in Ayr.

And what better way to celebrate the religious holiday this year by visiting Ayr’s oldest church. Thought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history. Visible from the A, the ‘country church’ was originally a rural Parish church dating back to the late th   early th centuries. It has been a living, working church without interruption ever since. The Church of Scotland branch has seen many changes over the years. In , the church on the Auchincruive site was originally called Sanchar-in-Kyle and was described as a rectory. In , it was mentioned in connection with the founding of the Gilbertine Priory of St Mary at Dalmulin within the Parish and in  came under the ownership of Paisley Abbey when the monks left Dalmulin. At this time it was a Roman Catholic Church and after the Reformation in , and the movement away from Rome, the church became used for the Protestant form of worship.  In , a major restoration was carried out to the original long church with the addition of a T-shaped wing. A relic wooden ladle used for the collection and communion cups, said to have been presented in , are still in use today. The last structural change to the church was seen in the early th century when the Whitletts and Craigie Galleries were added above each end of the original long church. The outside gallery stairs, still in existence, speak of an older time when the landed gentry did not mix with the people seated in the body of the kirk. And it’s hard to believe that back in those days there was very much a ide among the congregation between rich and poor. But that’s certainly not the case now. Church member and Convener for Fundraising and Events, Margaret McConnell said: “It’s always been quite a poor church. “The members and residents were either miners or worked on the fields. “Of course, there were quite a lot of farmers in the area but they were the wealthy ones.”  Speaking of the upper central gallery, Interim Moderator Rev Ken Yorke said: “That’s where the lords and ladies sat. “There was a fireplace up there and the story goes that when the local gentry was sitting there,he didn’t like what the minister was saying, he’d get up from his seat and go over to the fire and sit and warm himself.” Session Clerk David McMahon joked: “We don’t have any original members left anymore.” Margaret has a long standing relationship with the St Quivox, Auchincruive. She originally went to the church as a young girl then lived overseas for several years. But she admits finding her aunt Elizabeth’s grave in the church’s graveyard brought her “back to her roots”. She said: “Faith is a journey. “I joined the church  years ago. “My family were local residents and granny came to the church every Sunday.  “They were from Whitletts and used to walk along the Low Road, but now that’s the bypass.” Her family sat in one of the galleries, to the left of the minister. She later married in the church in . And it seems ministry runs in the family for Rev Ken too, whose father was a minister at Prestwick South for  years. Rev Ken said: “It’s not all about the minister though– we have faithful people who help out. It’s a team effort. “People nowadays, their attention span doesn’t last for too long so I try to speak for a short time but get all the important parts across. “There comes a time more than ever where Christian people and communities need to come together– still do their own thing– but come together to further God’s work.” David added: “A lot of our work is trying to involve the community. “It’s about getting in touch with the people.” St Quivox Auchincruive will host Holy Week and looks forward to welcoming those who wish to celebrate the holiday.  Margaret said: “Hosting the Holy Week Services at Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive provides a great opportunity for us to let everyone in the community know that the beautul old church is still open to all and welcomes everyone. “We would also like to extol the historical importance and the heritage of Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, as two of its former ministers were Moderators of the General Assembly – one of whom, Rev Archibald H Charteris, began ‘Le and Work’ magazine and also founded the Women’s Guild.” And although very proud of their beautul and historically rich place of worship, the trio agreed “the church is the people – not the building”. Church members meet together and operate between Ayr, St Quivox two churches Auchincruive and Dalmilling Church on Dalmilling Road, Ayr on alternating Sundays. Holy Week Services will be held at Auchincruive each evening at pm until Good Fridayand Easter Sunday funwill begin at .am , with breakfast served in the Crypt at .am and Service start at .am.

After much campaigning, Coylton like so many other villages lost its library services and the building stood empty for many months.   She said the £, rent could have went to other vital community services and blasted council cuts at the Coylton Gala.   The mother-of two added: How can they justy raising the council rates while this continuous waste of money is allowed to proceed unchecked    A council spokesman said: “The council’s lease at  Main Street Coylton was terminated in August , annual payments of £, were made up to this point in line with the lease agreement. The lease was not terminated earlier due to an administrative error.”   The council shut the Coylton hub  in Spring  along with two other libraries in Dailly and Dundonald to save a projected £, that year.   Coylton villagers waved placards as workers turned up to strip the shelves of books during a tense protest soon.  At the time council head of leisure Jill Cronin said the closure of the Coylton hub was “necessary” to “help the council balance its budget.” She added: We know local people are disappointed about the decision to close the library and we do sympathise.”  The Local Democracy Reporting Service was unable to reach the owner of the library building for comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14420843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_elliots2.jpg","title":"first look inside new elliots","story":"NewsFirst look inside the new Elliots as Prestwick firm Buzzworks unveil Vics and the VineBuzzworks have given a glimpse into their brand new venue, which is set to open in early May.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThe stylish exterior\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCustomers have been given a sneak peek into the revamped Elliots, which will open its doors next month.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14418225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_070319bypass_01JPG.jpg","title":"maybole bypass could create up","story":"NewsMaybole bypass could create up to  jobs, says the Scottish GovernmentThe official award of the construction contract has fired the starting gun on the long-awaited project.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsAn overview of the bypass route \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe project to build a bypass for Maybole could employ up to , it has been claimed.

The new bypass will benefit drivers on the A and opens the way for new investment and redevelopment in Maybole.It is disappointing that the Scottish Government chose not to fully dual the bypass, missing an opportunity to futureproof the road, but it’s still a major step forward for the area.This is an important investment but there’s much more that could be done to improve the A along its entire . Instead of resting on their laurels with this investment, I’ll continue to challenge the Scottish Government to set out a long term plan for further bypasses and more dual carriageway that will bring the A up to the standard drivers expect from a trunk road and help grow the economy across Ayrshire.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish GovernmentAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish water insists ayrshire drinking","story":"NewsScottish Water insists Ayrshire drinking supply is safe following concerns over taste and odourBosses at Scottish Water say the supply throughout Ayrshire is still safe to drink.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsScottish Water has ruled out health concerns \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshireaposs drinking water IS safe to consume, officials at Scottish Water insisted today.

The trainee paramedic was a size  and had a body mass indexof . when she was diagnosed with the disease at . At just ft tall and weighing st lbs, she was horried with the way she looked. Katy, from Troon, recalled: “When I look back, it feels like the big me with type  diabetes is a dferent person. “I was so self-conscious, and embarrassed to have type  diabetes so young and to have to inject in front of people.” Katy first attended a slimming group at , but struggled to lose any weight with it. And when doctors discovered her diabetes as she prepared for surgery to correct an underdeveloped jaw, she lost her confidence even more. She explained: “I was all geared up for the surgery. I’d been so self-conscious about both my weight and my jaw. I just wanted to get it sorted. “But, as the doctors were prepping me, they realised my blood sugar levels were sky high. The surgery was postponed as they ran tests, which showed I had type  diabetes. “Looking back, I’d had signs, like constant thirst, tiredness, and needing to go to urinate all the time, but I’d been too scared to go and have it all confirmed. “The diagnosis itself was devastating. I remember being shown how to inject myself, trying to do it and just sobbing, saying I couldn’t. “I then had to deal with going back to school and adjusting to this new le. I didn’t want anyone to see me injecting, and felt so embarrassed. “At that age, you just want to be like everyone . It was hell.” She went on: “I would eat rubbish – big plates of chips for lunch, then take-aways in the evening. “I did very little exercise too. I’d not long passed my driving test, so drove absolutely everywhere – including to the McDonald’s drive-thru most evenings.” Things changed for Katy when, in April , a Facebook post about WW – the new Weight Watchers – caught her eye. After initially trying out the plan, she was shocked to discover she had reduced her blood sugar levels to match those of someone without type  diabetes. She continued: “I saw these amazing before and after pictures and thought, ‘That’s what I want.’ “I knewI didn’t do it then I never would, so I contacted my WW leader Morag and went down to a meeting. “They explained how to use their SmartPoints system, which tracks food and drink to nudge users towards a more nutritious diet. “It made complete sense to me and I especially loved the app, enabling you to scan food in the supermarket and find out how many points it’s worth. “I’d tried other regimes in the past and hadn’t stuck to them, as they were so impractical. You can’t exactly go out to a restaurant and eat weight loss shakes or supplements. “But I liked WW as it didn’t bring attention to the fact I was trying to slim down. I could still eat the foods I liked, but it taught me about moderation and to stop pushing myself to eat when I was full.” Katy eventually hit her current weight of st lb and has never been happier. She no longer needs to inject insulin, she just takes two Metformin tablets a day – a drug often used to treat type  diabetes. The charity Diabetes UK says that though there is no guarantee that the condition has gone forever – it is possible to go into remission – and losing around kgincreases the chances of doing so. Katy now lives on fresh, home-cooked meals, prepared from scratch and hits the gym three times a week, where she does cardio and lts weights. She said: “My advice to anyone  out there feeling how I once did is just to take those first steps, go to that first meeting. “It doesn’t take long for change to happen. You can still go out, have fun and socialise too. “You don’t need to stop your le in order to feel dferent.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrBMIFacebookSupermarketsEducationSocial mediaTroon"},{"url":null,"title":"greggs-submits-plans-to-develop-galashiels-eyesore","story":"GREGGS has submitted an application to develop a Galashiels eyesore.The bakery chain is hoping to open a new store at the former Ozkans Grill takeaway in Market Street.Andsuccessful, it would have an outdoor seating area for customers.Over the last few months, the town centre site has been targeted by vandals.Since the takeaway closed, windows have been smashed and the store front covered with graffiti.But proposals submitted to Scottish Borders Council this week show Greggs is hoping to give the unit a facelt and would install four tables and  chairs in the outdoor seating area.The chain, which was launched in Newcastle in , has around , shops nationwide including one in Channel Street.However, it is not yet clearthat would remain openthe plans were given the go-ahead.The firm also has stores in Hawick, Kelso and Peebles.The Borderhas contacted Greggs for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"housebuilder-apologises-after-admitting-responsibility-for-defective-peebles-homes","story":"ONE of the countrys largest housebuilding firms has finally issued an apology to Peebles homeowners.For over two years seven families living on the Kingsmeadows development have been battling with the builders over defects caused by crumbling mortar.Earlier this year Taylor Wimpey acknowledged, as part of its full year results statement, concerns regarding mortar durability and added that a \"robust technical solution\" to fix the problem had been identied.Work has already started on the affected  properties and this week, the company offered an apology.A Taylor Wimpey spokesperson told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoWe sincerely apologise to the affected homeowners for the issues that they have experienced within some homes at our Kingsmeadow development in Peebles.\"While a signicant number of houses on the development are unaffected by mortar issues, a robust technical solution to fix the durability of the mortar has been identied, which is supported by our appointed structural engineer, an independent review by the Scottish Borders Council, and the National House Building Council.\"We have a clear plan in place to remediate affected homes and works have already begun on the development.Problems first emerged with houses on the Kingsmeadows development in .Scottish Borders Councils building standards officers were contacted as well as Taylor Wimpey.The developer bought back several properties from householders after faults were identied.Non-disclosure agreements prevented the families from discussing the issues.In  more concerns were raised with the local authority over public safety on the development.And Tracey Logan, chief executive of Scottish Borders Council, called a meeting with Taylor Wimpey bosses where it was agreed for an independent structural engineer to carry out surveys.Although no structural issues were identied during the surveys of randomly selected properties the developer acknowledged there were problems with mortar on some houses.And towards the end of last year they sent out letters offering to carry out remedial action.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council told us: \"The first public safety concerns were raised with the council in late .\"In response to these concerns, the Chief Executive requested a meeting with Taylor Wimpey to investigate the concerns.\"At this meeting, it was agreed that an independent structural engineer would be commissioned to carry out structural surveys in a number of randomly selected properties.\"This was carried out in summer .\"The council did not have an official role in this process, but it was considered important to provide an independent opinion on the situation to ensure that any concerns were identied and addressed effectively and consider whether there was any public safety risk.\"The report identied no structural issues with the inspected houses and was satisfied with Taylor Wimpeyrsquos proposed remedial action to repair potential defects,required, andthe owners wished to take up this offer, which we understand a number of residents have.\"A BBC investigations team identied that the Peebles housing development was one of  across the country where inferior mortar had been used.Sheila Chalmers and her husband recruited their own structural engineers to carry out assessments on their Peebles home -

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge.

Yet this -year-old building carries meaning far beyond the countryrsquos border. It was here that Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned, and Joan of Arc beatied, but it was also the scene of Henry VI of Englandrsquos coronation as King of France, when he was a child. More than a century later, on April  , , Mary Stuart was married beneath its graceful soaring roof to Francis, the dauphin, son of Henri II. By all accounts it was an eye-wateringly extravagant event. A large theatrical stage was built outside the cathedral, and inside there was a massive triumphal arch. As weddings went, it was the most spectacular Notre Dame had ever witnessed.Read more: Macron vows to rebuild cathedralI doubt therersquos a country in Europe whose history has not crossed with the cathedralrsquos at some point. In certain respects, it is the most venerable symbol of an emerging Europe, a fulcrum for events that have made the continent what it is today. No wonder crowds watching the inferno from the Icircle de la Citeacute or on television wept.The largest of its  bells, Emmanuel, shares its name with the president. This coincidence might just prove fateful. Mr Macron rushed to the scene before the fire wholly engulfed the roof and spire. It is a little ironic that, as the flames took hold, he cancelled a recorded speech due to be broadcast at eight that evening. This statement was intended to restart his first term in office, and go some way towards appeasing the gilets jaunes movement, which has badly damaged his credibility and his countryrsquos stability.Doubtless he postponed because of the gravity of the unfolding disaster. Even so, Mr Macronrsquos emotional proclamation late into the night, in which he pledged to see the cathedral restored to glory, might prove to have been a masterly stroke.It is too cynical to suggest that even as the fire blazed the president understood that this crisis could improve his standing. But the political fall-out might nevertheless work to his advantage. In a way that no prepared script could, the presidentrsquos response to the fire, and his assurance that ldquotogether the cathedral will be rebuilt, will have won him new friends and admirers. He might have misjudged the national mood when handling the gilets jaunesrsquo demands, but on the night when Notre Dame burned, he too was ablaze. Instinctively he gauged the depth of feeling this place rouses in the people he governs. That affection, and the profound heritage the cathedral represents, crosses political, ideological and class ides. The wealthy of the Bouled Saint Germain feel the same in this matter as their compatriots in downtrodden rural France.If anything could unite people across the board, it is the sight of the countryrsquos best-loved building wreathed in blood-orange smoke. Some will doubtless see this calamity as a warning or sign, as when York Minster went on fire. Certainly, the potency of the pictures of such a blaze is primitive. You cannot fail to respond, nor to feel a passing shiver of superstition that, at this exceptionally troubled and uncertain time in Europe, it holds a message of some kind.For Mr Macron, that message might simply be that Notre Dame is a symbol of what unites the nation, an olive branch of sorts. In promising without hesitation to secure its future, he was committing also to hold together the France of liberteacute, eacutegaliteacute and fraterniteacute.It might not be the speech he expected to deliver, but it mayprove to be the finest he has yet made."},{"url":null,"title":"off-the-plot-beechgroves-hardy-perennial-jim-mccoll-retires-at-83","story":"But, aged , the Beechgrove Garden host has finally admitted it is time for him to lose the plot.BBC Scotland has announced his oh-so-very reluctant retirement from the show he has presented since .

This is obviously not ideal.\"Even those who implemented the SNSA with their own class did not always appreciate the range of implementation decisions they could make.One teacher told the forum: ldquoI was amazed about what other people had been told.\"I didnrsquot know we could stop mid-way, that there were practice activities they could do beforehand or that I could let children choose what technologyto use.The report said the current online training strategiesfor teachers were ldquopoorly advertised and that council meetings ldquodid not always reach P classroom teachers.There was no printed manual that described what the SNSA offered or how it worked, the report said.However, many critics wanted to see the assessments scrapped altogether amidst concern the stress of the tests left children \"shaking and crying\".Sue Palmer, chair of the UpstartScotlandcampaign forplay-based education, said all tests at that age would be considered high stakes \"no matter how manyguidelines the government produces\".She said: \"The very existence of nationalstandardised tests in literacy and numeracy for five-year-olds istotally incompatible with play-based learning and will inevitably affectteaching practice in ways that will be damaging for many children.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotlandsaid the teaching union was \"unconvinced\" of the need for standardised assessments in P.: Independent review to decide future of P testingHe said: \"They were not designed to be compatible with a play based approach, and no amount of guidance on their use alters this basic weakness.\"There was also concern over the timing of the announcement, with the suggestion Mr Swinney was getting his retaliation in first.The decision to publish the forums reportwas taken in advance of the separate report of an independent review of P assessments, led by David Reedy.Ms Palmer said: \"An independent review of the P assessments is due to report nextmonth.

people canrsquot get on them when they want and often they donrsquot run, or there are not enough of them in the summer.ldquoHow much in subsidy does CalMac get over  years  When you add it up a tunnel is not such a daft idea.

I told him how strongly many local people felt about this, because of the impact of building a whole new road north and east of the town.“He revealed that Transport Scotland has no intention of looking again at the A options, despite the fact that they have made their case on the basis of completely out-of-date information.“Road users from Inverurie and further west know full well that the AWPR has had a major impact on the A at Inverurie, which only strengthens the case for upgrading that specic stretch of existing road.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Connie Sorrie with the award and the Greengrocer family team\"  National award for family firm viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Ministers must listen to local people on this issue, and base any decisions on up-to-date traffic data.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I do not suppose former councillor Jonathan Wills would care to comment nor for that matter Gary Robinson, the former Council Political Leader. #Nota Bene#, yesterdays men to the fore as they say every picture tells a story!!!.So after the country voted to leave these clowns think we should vote again with remain or remain on the ballot. No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away# So very true today.Spot on Ian !! Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn.

That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from !

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2108-21-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of .

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a request that was denied.The tribunal heard that Ms Wilson had a panic attack on the telephone with a human resources worker when advised of Ms Hardings proposed attendance at the meeting.Ms Wilson then lodged a grievance by letter in which she formalised her complaint of bullying and detailed her concerns, including the handling of the -to-work meeting.Following an investigation into Ms Wilsons list of  complaints, an outcome letter in November  stated that \"no evidence of bullying and harassment\" from Ms Harding could be found.Ms Wilson appealed this outcome, but the charity did not uphold her appeal or find her complaints substantiated.She resigned following receipt of the grievance outcome the following February.The tribunal was told of an incident on June , , nine days before Ms Wilson went on sick leave, when she had been shouted at and humiliated in front of her colleagues by Ms Harding.Earlier that same year, in an appraisal, Ms Harding was critical of Ms Wilsons time management skills and compared her unfavourably with other staff.Barrister Sean Doherty, acting on behalf of Praxis Care, suggested it was \"a matter of interpretation as to whether this amounted to bullying\".He noted that Ms Harding had accepted she was direct and he conceded that she was undoubtedly confrontational due to her frustration that \"paperwork had not been completed\".He characterised the incident as having happened \"in the heat of the moment\".Mr Doherty further suggested that Ms Wilsons complaint about the grievance process was driven by her disappointment at not being vindicated.In his submission, Mr Doherty said the -to-work meeting was an opportunity to address matters and suggested the purpose of Ms Hardings attendance was \"not to berate and criticise\" Ms Wilson.The tribunal found the conduct of Praxis \"was likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence\" with Ms Wilson and that she had \"resigned in response to this conduct\".It also ruled that Ms Wilsons grievances were \"not investigated in a fair and appropriate manner.\"It did not accept Mr Dohertys contention that Ms Wilson did not resign quickly enough, stating that she chose to exercise her contractual right to seek redress of her complaints through the grievance procedure and appeal.\"She was reserving her position following the y period of incapacity,\" it stated.A further remedies hearing will be convenedboth parties are unable to agree on financial losses incurred by Ms Wilson."},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents in vow to ignore psni over newry easter event","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I am a border unionist and I know exactly what all this means.\"There are those who claim to represent people who voted Remain, but they havent represented unionists who voted Remain in the last two years and they wont do so in the future.\"Unionists who voted to remain in the EU did not vote to leave the United Kingdom.\"Mr Eastwood, the SDLP leader, also confirmed yesterday that he would run for the European Parliament, saying it should be regarded as another referendum.The Foyle MLA described next months vote as an \"election like no other\".\"In June  a majority of people from communities across Northern Ireland came together to express our clear will that we should remain in the European Union,\" he said.\"It was a vote that, unlike many others, saw people break free from their traditional trenches to occupy a common ground and a common identity.\"Since then, the broad progressive coalition that came together has been sidelined and silenced. Without a government in Belfast and with the DUP aligned to hard Brexit fanatics in London, people here have been ignored. Enough is enough.\"This European election should be a referendum - the Norths peoples vote.\"Mr Eastwood said the SDLP would be \"a strong voice championing our shared values\" and opposing what he said was the \"destructive ideology\" leading the UK Government towards a hard border. Ms Long said she was running as an Alliance candidate to allow voters to express their will for a second referendum.Speaking as she submitted her nomination papers at the Electoral Office of Northern Irelands headquarters in Belfast yesterday, Ms Long, an East Belfast MLA, said the \"chaos and uncertainty created by Brexit\" had impacted every aspect of le.\"People felt badly let down in the  referendum and since, and Parliament has now reached an impasse,\" she added.\"The best and potentially only way through this crisis is to put Brexit back to the people.\"Alliance supports a peoples vote, crucially including the option to remain.\"A vote for Alliance in this election is the best way to send a clear message we want that new referendum.\"At the last European elections in  the three Northern Ireland seats went to Sinn Feins Martina Anderson, the DUPs Diane Dodds and Mr Nicholson of the UUP. The SDLP missed out on winning the third seat by fewer than , votes.The main candidates running for the three seats this time are Ms Anderson, Mrs Dodds, Mr Kennedy, Mr Eastwood and Ms Long. Clare Bailey will run for the Green Party while Robert Hill will run for Ukip.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\". Pointing out that McBride came before the court with a clear record, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the impact the offending has had on McBrides domestic situation and also on his business as \"people dont want to associate with him because of the nature of the allegations\".Judge Miller said that after reading a pre-sentence report, he felt McBride had displayed both \"an apparent lack of empathy\" for the complainant, and a \"self-centred attitude.\"The judge also cast doubt on McBrides claims he believed the girl was  when they began having sex, saying it was his belief McBride deliberately targeted someone \"half his age\" for his own \"deviant sexual interests\".As well as being jailed, McBride was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, the French leader immediately went to the scene of the fire and announced: “We will rebuild Notre Dame.”According to an opinion poll by BVA institute – the first one since the fire — Mr Macron has gained three points in popularity since last month, from % to %.

delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, imploring him to reverse a decision on its proposed closure.The group gathered outside the Guildhall in the cold as the Permanent Secretary from the Department for Education met a cross-party delegation inside.The meeting follows a motion proposed by SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack stating that it recognised “local schools are facing unprecedented financial pressures following real reductions in core funding for education, to the sum of £ per pupil over the last number of years.”There was disappointment amongst the parents and young people when it was decided that Mr Baker would not come outside to personally address their concerns.Instead, it was agreed that one parent, Leanne Brown, would enter the Mayor’s parlour on behalf of the group to present Mr Baker with letters written by children from the Coshquin-based school.She hopes Mr Baker will take time to digest the messages and pictures drawn by children which express their “love” for the school, and that they will inform his decision.Speaking outside the Guildhall on Tuesday, Ivan Peoples, who attended the school as a pupil and now has a child in primary , said he came along to voice his concerns to decision-makers.“I thought the whole future of Northern Ireland was to integrate both sides of the community and I don’t understand why they’d want to close the only one they have on the West Bank.“Foyle College has already moved to the Waterside, and the only other school we have in the city is Oakgrove, and for us to travel over there could cause problems.  If it’s a windy day the bridge can be closed.“The school is integrated in more than just religion, there are people with additional needs, and I think it teaches young people to be caring towards people with needs and can help prevent bullying further down the line.“It was a small school when I was there and I don’t see why they should close it now when there is going to be so much development around it.”Martina McCourt’s son Michael is the most recent pupil to enrol at Groarty P.S. after she decided the school was best-placed to meet his “complex needs”.“Because the school he was at was so big there weren’t enough staff to cater for his needs.“The staff there are fantastic and they picked up on things straight away, certain traits in class, and when I was expressing concerns they were in agreement.“I’m only finding out myself that there are pupils with dferent needs, some with severe needs, and each one of them is being catered for as an inidual and they all accept each other.“It’s

retained and a new build for that school which at one stage they were promised with all the new development around Skeoge.”Meanwhile, Independent Councillor Darren O’Reilly, was at the meeting with Mr Baker and he said ious points were aired about the pressures faced by parents, principals and frontline workers.“There needs to be pressure politically and people need to take direct action like we’ve seen today.  More of that is needed to put pressure onKaren Bradley.“Our school system is in a serious mess, a crisis, and I don’t think the Tories are too worried about wains in Derry.  We need to make sure they know and the only way to do that is to campaign.“All the parties were unied in saying schools need more resources and Groarty P.S. needs to be protected.”Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still suspended, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The closing date for the consultation process is June  and for those who want to view documents, you can visit: www.eani.org.uk prepublication-consultations groarty-ipsPhoto: Groarty Integrated P.S.

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated.

Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling. A number of items have been identied, including fine copper alloy dress pins, a socketed arrowhead, a horseshoe, a pair of iron shears and even aof chain with a suspension hook still attached.In addition, three samples mdash charred grain, charcoal and a fragment of twig mdash were put forward for radiocarbon dating.The twig fragment ed a date range of - AD which fits very well with the pottery types recovered from the midden pit. However, the charred grain and charcoal ed very similar dates of - AD and - AD respectively.This indicates that earlier activity relating to the early Christian monastic site of the th Century AD, when the original St Patrickrsquos Cross was erected, is there and waiting to be uncovered.A number of finds have now been placed on display in the High Cross Gallery at Down County Museum, in two new cases funded by the British Museum Trust, while research work continues on the collection of artefacts, dating from the Mesolithicthrough to modern times.This project was supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .Match-funding for this project has been provided by The Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department for Rural and Community Development in Ireland.To find out how to get involved in the excavation in August, contact Down County Museum on   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch teams are All Ireland champions  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH was at the centre of Irelandrsquos sporting world at the weekend.It was a case of doubles all round for the townrsquos rugby club.The lsquoHinch won the All-Ireland League Division B title and their fourths lted the coveted Crawford Cup at the Kingspan Stadium.Just to make it a Super Saturday, Ballynahinch Hockey Club travelled down to Dublin and lted the Irish Challenge Hockey Cup for the second year in succession to complete a memorable season for Mark Brownrsquos boys.The rugby first XV dealt with St Maryrsquos College without undue trouble at Ballymacarn Park to secure their place in the top flight of Irish club rugby.Their - victory prompted huge celebrations after skipper Aaron Cairns got his hands on the trophy.ldquoThis is massive for the club, said Cairns. ldquoAll the hard work this season has finally paid off.ldquoWe wouldnrsquot have got here without our coaches, Brian McLaughlin and Tom Rock, and all the backroom staff.ldquoThere is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and without that we couldnrsquot do it.ldquoWersquove learnt lessons from our time before in A and hopefully wersquoll take that back up with us and see how we get on, added Cairns.Indeed, the trick will be staying in A somewhat longer this time around mdash lsquoHinch managed three campaigns of mostly struggle before exiting in  mdash and that fresh challenge awaits Brian McLaughlinrsquos squad.Over at Ravenhill, an experienced fourths team had just enough in the tank to defeat local rivals Banbridge thirds - to keep the Crawford Cup in the Ballymacarn Park trophy cabinet for another year.The lsquoHinch were good value for their victory in a tough, uncompromising battle, but the lsquoHinchrsquos greater experience stood them in good stead.All heads then turned towards Dublin where the hockey club faced Limerick at Serpentine Avenue in the Irish Challenge Cup final.Manager Mark Brown sent his troops out full of confidence and goals from man of the match William Edgar , Scott Leetch and Matthew Martin were good enough to give them a - victory in an entertaining final.Edgarrsquos two pieces of inidual brilliance were worthy of winning any competition in a superb display of expansive, attacking hockey.This was Ballynahinchrsquos third Irish title in seven years mdash and by far the hardest to win.The game went back and forth at breakneck speed with goals soon starting to flow.lsquoHinch, always look the more composed side with former Instonians man Matthew Martin and the predatory Edgar having that touch of class.Limerick made a real go of it in the last five minutes, but Ballynahinch had the nous to see out the game and lt the crown for a third time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Calum wins heat at Mary Peters Track  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC juniors attended the first meet of the Firmus Fab  Series at the Mary Peters Track on Thursday night, taking part in nine events collectively.Calum Cope won his heat in the U- boysrsquo  metre race.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

He stated: ldquoIt is my understanding that a mayor should not use their position to promote any political message.Mr Wilson has made a formal complaint to the council and asked why the event was allowed to take place.He added: ldquoI am also aware that one of the speakers referred to lsquothe memory of our patriot dead across Counties Derry and Antrimrsquo and how lsquotheir ultimate sacrice continues to inspire us daily on our path to Irish unityrsquo.ldquoThat is not referring to the dead of  who were nowhere to be seen in counties Londonderry and Antrim. The people of Coleraine and the surrounding areas are only too well aware of the murderous and criminal deeds of the type of republican lsquopatriotsrsquo which Sinn Fein are so fond of eulogising.Mr Wilson highlighted the IRA bombing of Coleraine in , in which six pensionerswere killed.He added: ldquoIn  the bombers ed and levelled the town centre.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquom very keen to see this come further forward otherwise the Vale of Glamorgan is going to grind to a halt.Campaigners say villagers have been left in limbo by the plans because as many as nine families ndash % of the village ndash in Pendoylan could be forced to leave their homes as part of the plans.Campaigners say families are living daily with the anxiety and are unable to move on and sell their homes as the proposed new road is frightening potential buyers away.They say one elderly resident of Pendoylan, now living in a residential home, is unable to sell her house to pay for the care she needs as her property will be demolished to make way for the new roadthe councilrsquos plans proceed .And Vale Communities For Future Generations say residents inPendoylan and Peterston Super Ely could also be blighted by the air pollution and noise from HGVsthe road is built.The council says ldquono firm decision has been made to build a new road. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When she finally went to the health centre, she was told todaywas ‘emergencies only as there was only one doctor on duty’.She said the situation is ‘totally unacceptable’. “This is  and we are having to put up with a broken NHS,” she said.

action ballot planned for   moy park workers  ","story":"More than , workers in Moy Park are to be balloted for strike action as frustration mounts over pay negotiations.The workers, mostly on the two main sites at Portadown and Dungannon, are to be balloted on whether they wish to take strike action within weeks.Moy Park is one of NI’s largest employers and, according to Unite, the union, there has been serious problems with management during negotiations.Sean McKeever, Unite Regional Officer representing his union’s membership at Moy Park sites, said the union would be balloting over ‘unreasonable management demands in ongoing pay negotiations’.“When Moy Park was sold by Brazilian meat-packing giant JBS SA to one of its own subsidiaries, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp of the USA, Unite the union forecasted that this would presage a broader onslaught on workforce terms and conditions. Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age.
