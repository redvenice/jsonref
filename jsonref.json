Families split and you get on with your life.\u0027 When told that sounded cold, the actor replied \u0027Well, it is cold. Because life is cold.\u0027I don\u0027t find Sir Anthony\u0027s attitude that upsetting - probably because I had a whole host of problems with my own dysfunctional family. We were never close, and there were periods after I left home when we didn\u0027t speak for months, and then, one of us would hang up the phone in a fit of rage. A few years ago, I wrote best-selling book (Baggage) about my dreadul relationship with my mother, a difficult woman I never understood until after her death.REVEALED: Why Anthony Hopkins and his daughter have barely...Share this articleHundreds of women told me they had had difficult relationships with their mothers, and they had little in common. The relationship between fathers and their daughters is equally sacrosanct - if a parent dares to step out of line and tell the world that they can\u0027t stand their child, that they find it hard to be in the same room, that they have nothing in common, the world is disgusted, repulsed - you\u0027re not seen as \u0027human\u0027.Maybe this is because we live in an age of fake friendliness, people who you have only ever \u0027liked\u0027 on instagram or fakebook get rated as pals. We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking. If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say hello.Sir Anthony is a proud old man who cannot be held responsible for what happened nearly half a century ago. I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E73ED00000578-5771503-image-a-18_1527255437250.jpg","title":"Weinstein hands NYPD biography book Broadway","story":"    Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct with a pile of books under his arm          One of the books is Elia Kazan: A Biography, about the influential film and theater director from the late forties through the sixties          The other was Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein\u0027s Broadway Revolution          The 66-year-old disgraced movie mogul seemed carefree as he was arrested, processed and booked for the alleged sexual assault of two women shortly after 7:30amKazan, who was once one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood, but also had an epic fall from grace during the witch hunt by Sen.

With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company.

(In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/01/4CA2C1FA00000578-0-image-m-31_1527294733812.jpg","title":"Morgan Freemans creepy camera  female reporters revealed","story":"    Actor Morgan Freeman (above) is under fire after a report accusing him of misconductMorgan Freeman has spoken out again in response to allegations he sexually harassed at least eight different women to insist he is not a predator and say he is \u0027devastated\u0027 by any suggestion that he is. On Thursday, CNN published claims by eight women who alleged that Freeman had either spoken to them inappropriately, \u0027touched\u0027 them without them wanting him to or, in one of the most severe cases, lifted up their skirts. The actor issued an apology after the report emerged and said he never intended to make any of the women feel uncomfortable. But afterwards, as he was dumped by sponsors including Visa and as his legendary acting career was momentarily eclipsed by the scandal, he spoke out again. In a statement to DailyMail.com late on Friday night, the star said: \u0027I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports.Downfall of a Hollywood deity: Once revered in Tinseltown,...Visa dumps Morgan Freeman as the voice of its commercials as...Share this article\u0027All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard.

Butina is pictured at the 2015 NRA convention. Senate Democrats say they have proof Russians were funneling money through the NRA to support Trump\u0027s campaign However, the FBI\u0027s interest in the calls may be sign of suspicion over what money, if any, Torshin or any other Russian gave the NRA in the run-up to Trump\u0027s campaign. It has been claimed by Senate Democrats that he funneled money into the NRA and in turn bolstered Trump\u0027s campaign. The NRA has insisted that Torshin only ever paid his membership fees but admitted previously to taking roughly $2,500 in contributions from Russian-linked contributors. Torshin is on a list of oligarchs who have been sanctioned by the Treasury Department. In banning him, they said it was proven that he had been trying to influence the American political system for years, since long before Trump announced his campaign, and that he was trying to act on Putin\u0027s behalf to push his agenda.  Spanish police have long been trying to snare him and came close to it in 2013 when they planned to arrest him at a party thrown by Romanov on the island of Mallorca. He never showed up and has evaded them ever since. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/13/4CA5512B00000578-5774429-image-m-18_1527337495604.jpg","title":"Radio 2 listeners revolt new drivetime format","story":"    Radio 2 producers are facing a revolt over Jo Whiley joining Simon Mayo (pictured together at Radio 2 Live in September 2016) for the drivetime show          One inidual said \u0027you cannot ignore us, we will not go away\u0027 over the change          Another said: \u0027This doesn\u0027t do it for me and I\u0027ve given it enough of a chance - I\u0027m off to find something entertaining\u0027\u0027When is this going to happen?

That firm, along with its peers, has been at the heart of the financial crisis and other debacles, but the auditors have largely escaped scrutiny.Now the mask is torn off in an explosive new book, Bean Counters by investigative journalist Richard Brooks. He has set out in unsparing detail how Britain’s largest audit firms have consistently turned a blind eye to scandals and wrongdoing, and not only got away with it, but also charged enormous fees.BIG SHOT OF THE WEEK: Santander\u0027s Ana Botin knows her way...Balfour Beatty is hit by row over fat cat pay after Chief...Sainsbury’s wages war on big suppliers as part of its...How on earth has BT chief earned a £1 million pay rise?...Now Netflix overtakes Disney to become the biggest media...Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Share this articleAn audit – essentially an independent check of the books and systems – is a vital safeguard for shareholders, as well as for employees, customers and society as a whole. It is meant to give reassurance that the company in question is not about to go bust and that its accounts give a true and fair picture of its financial position.All too often, however, it does nothing of the sort – and when the auditors fail, we all suffer. Taxpayers are forced to foot the bill for bank bailouts. Black holes bloom in company pension funds. Small shareholders lose their shirts. Employees lose their jobs. Corporate tax revenues that could have financed schools and hospitals go unpaid.          Exclusive: The Number Twenty club for KPMG executivesxAnd all of these consequences could perhaps have been averted if only the auditors had sounded an alarm in time.The behaviour of the Big Four auditors – Deloitte, PwC and EY alongside KPMG – has been obscured by the veneer of prudence, even boringness, that they cultivate. Yet every single murky episode of recent years – from the implosion of RBS to the antics of the Crystal Methodist Paul Flowers at the Co-operative Bank to corruption at Fifa – has erupted with no advance warning.As Brooks points out, the top audit firms are riddled with conflicts of interest. Their huge fees act as an incentive for them to placate, rather than confront company bosses, and senior accountants themselves often go on to hold important roles in corporate Britain where they may stay loyal to their former colleagues.The failings of auditors came under inspection in the financial crisis but nothing happened. They are in the spotlight again for their role in the downfall of outsourcing firm Carillion. MPs earlier this month criticised KPMG for being complicit in ‘recklessness, hubris and greed’ at the company, which collapsed earlier this year under the weight of its debt. That affair has led to calls for draconian reforms to the audit firms. On past form, the bean-counters will walk away scot-free and continue to enrich themselves with impunity – unless they are finally called to account.          A former chieftain at Big Four auditor Deloitte, John Connolly is just one of the multi-millionaire partners who haunt the pages of Richard Brooks’ shocking exposéAs a 29-year-old junior auditor in PwC’s Luxembourg office in 2010, Deltour had stumbled across hundreds of secret ‘advance tax agreements’ between his firm’s clients and the Luxembourg tax authorities. In essence these were documents showing how the tax authorities had agreed to complicated schemes cooked up by PwC that would save the firms in question billions in tax.Sensationally, Deltour had found and copied more than 500 ‘rulings’ involving 350 companies. When he passed the information to a journalist in what became known as the ‘Luxleaks’ scandal, Deltour lifted the lid on one of the biggest ever tax avoidance factories in recent years. Another former PwC employee, office support worker Raphael Halet told a Luxembourg court in 2016 how the accountancy firm would send applications for approval on a Wednesday afternoon around 1.30pm to the director of the corporate tax office. PwC would draft not only the applications but also the taxman’s agreement letters, under the letterhead of the tax ision. The director had only to sign off, and literally rubber stamp the agreements.Tax avoidance isn’t new. The bricked-up windows still to be seen in old London houses tell of the reluctance in the 18th Century to pay window-tax. But in recent years, it has morphed from a relatively amateurish game into a worldwide industry – and the pioneers were the accountants. In an age of online transactions and globalisation it is easy for big companies to structure their businesses so the most profitable parts could be placed where they were lightly taxed.          Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7Companies such as Gap and Nike sold to customers around the world from tax-friendly locations such as the Netherlands. Drugs companies including GlaxoSmithKline held the rights to blockbuster pharmaceuticals in fiscally efficient locations. Now the big tech companies like Apple and Google save billions of dollars in taxes in much the same way – all with the advice of the Big Four accountancy firms.Caught offside Accountancy failure can allow corruption to go unnoticed for years. The canker silently rots business from within, and only occasionally erupts into public view. When it does, however, it can be spectacular. One such case began to unfold at 6am on May 27, 2015. When the sun rose over a serene Lake Zurich, plain-clothed Swiss police officers marched into the five-star Hotel Baur du Lac. Once inside, they woke seven of the world’s top ten football officials with arrest warrants.Hours later, the then US Attorney General Loretta Lynch unveiled a 161-page indictment against these and other FIFA officials, with offences from bribery to racketeering to money laundering alleged to have taken place over 20 years.How had the governing organisation of the biggest sport on earth got away with so much corruption for so long? A large part of the answer was that its auditors, KPMG, had allowed it to.From the start, when KPMG took on the audit in 1999, there should have been red flags. A year earlier, the then new president Sepp Blatter had repaid the Saudi football federation for their support in his election with a sum of 470,000 Swiss francs to an unidentified recipient, without authorisation from the relevant committee. No alarm was raised.But that was small beer compared with a decade later, in 2009, when payments adding up to $10 million were wired from FIFA accounts in Switzerland to Caribbean Football Union accounts at the Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.The accounts were controlled by former Trinidadian football executive Jack Warner, who has since been banned from the game for life. This was part of a scheme to bribe Warner into voting for South Africa’s successful bid to host the 2010 World Cup, according to the US Department of Justice.Again, KPMG raised no alarms, despite well-known question marks over Warner’s dealings. Nor did the audit firm speak out against a co-ordinated attempt by Blatter and two other former top officials in 2010 to enrich themselves through salary increases, World Cup bonuses and other incentives adding up to more than 79 million Swiss francs over five years.In October last year, Swiss audit regulators said ‘shortcomings’ had been found in KPMG’s work between 2008 and 2014 and one inidual was reprimanded.Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7, priced £18.99.

UK car production rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 1970s and today provides more than 800,000 jobs in Britain.Why, then, am I filled with a sense of foreboding? Quite simply because I fear hardline Brexiteers are in danger of achieving what that rabble of militant trade unions failed to do: destroying the British car industry.In fact, I am even more worried than I was back then, when at least I could help fix the part of the industry I ran myself. Today, our fate lies in the hands of politicians whose negotiations threaten not just our own business but the whole British economy.Revealed: How letting an ambulance past can land motorists...Gardeners\u0027 World guest is accused of racism for calling the...Share this articleThat’s not just my view. I can assure you that the leaders of all the other big automotive firms agree that we are in real danger of damaging an industry we have spent decades rebuilding.At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril.Why? Allow me to explain. One of the biggest reasons the automotive industry failed in the 1970s is that supply chains were seriously disrupted and completely unpredictable, so costs soared and quality deteriorated.Modern supply chains need to be super-efficient. The car industry has been described as the most complex organisation of human endeavour on the planet, which is not surprising when you consider that there are more than 20 million variations of, for example, a Range Rover. Precisely the correct part must be available at the right time when the car moves down the production line.          At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril (file image)For example a red, right- hand, heated, electronic wing mirror must arrive for car number one and then, for car number two, a blue one with a different specification.These components come from all over the world, with the vast majority being sourced outside Europe. Car supply chains are particularly at risk of delay because 60 per cent of parts are imported. That equates to more than a thousand delivery lorries from the Continent to the UK every day.Take fuel tanks, for instance. People don’t stop to think about them, but of course you can’t get a car off a production line without one. Half of all the cars made in Britain rely on fuel tanks that come from Unipart’s factories in this country.It takes a long, long time to design and develop each tank. They are sophisticated and complex products with multiple components coming from continental Europe. All that could be thrown into expensive disarray if just one component is not there when we need it.The idea that we could start sourcing all the components for the fuel tanks in the UK just doesn’t work. We would love to, but it isn’t possible – if it were, we would already be doing it.The issue here is not one of border tariffs. The hard Brexiteers say that since German manufacturers want to sell their cars to us in the UK, there is no incentive for them to try to impose heavy tariffs after Brexit. Perhaps so. But that’s not the real problem.Tariffs hurt competitiveness and we don’t like that, but at least we can plan for them because they are quantifiable and predictable. Delays at border checkpoints, however, are disastrous precisely because they are so unpredictable.If we don’t know where a part is because it is stuck on a lorry in Europe and can’t get across the border, or they haven’t trained enough customs officials yet, then we have no certainty when it will arrive. The industry operates efficient ‘just-in-time’ practices so stock is not left lying around. That means we would normally have only enough parts at customers’ factories to keep the production lines running for just eight hours.But if the right part isn’t there when it is needed, you either have to send the car on and rework it afterwards, which is expensive and hurts quality, or you have to stop the production line. And that is very expensive, costing more than £1 million an hour – all for the sake of that single missing component.If we barrel headlong towards a hard Brexit, I fear such border delays are not only possible but inevitable, with the result that I believe the British motor industry will find it very difficult to survive in the long term.The hard Brexiteers prefer to avoid discussion of such practicalities, with talk of the UK forging new trade deals outside the EU. But again, it is more complex than that.For instance, a free-trade agreement with South Korea currently requires that cars we manufacture in the UK for export to Korea have 55 per cent of ‘local content’.Under the current rules, British-based car firms are allowed to count all EU components as being of local origin, even though only 25 per cent of them are typically sourced here. With a hard Brexit, I am not sure we can do that any longer, so the deal simply doesn’t work.Now do you understand why automotive bosses like me are so worried?But this is not just about the survival of firms such as mine, it is about the pounds in your pocket. The car industry benefits the UK economy to the tune of £200 billion a year and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs.Many people don’t realise that if the car industry fails, the economy will go with it. No one voted in the referendum to lose their jobs or their income.So what, then, can be done to avoid looming disaster. At the minimum, we must stay in the customs union.

Butina is pictured at the 2015 NRA convention. Senate Democrats say they have proof Russians were funneling money through the NRA to support Trump\u0027s campaign However, the FBI\u0027s interest in the calls may be sign of suspicion over what money, if any, Torshin or any other Russian gave the NRA in the run-up to Trump\u0027s campaign. It has been claimed by Senate Democrats that he funneled money into the NRA and in turn bolstered Trump\u0027s campaign. The NRA has insisted that Torshin only ever paid his membership fees but admitted previously to taking roughly $2,500 in contributions from Russian-linked contributors. Torshin is on a list of oligarchs who have been sanctioned by the Treasury Department. In banning him, they said it was proven that he had been trying to influence the American political system for years, since long before Trump announced his campaign, and that he was trying to act on Putin\u0027s behalf to push his agenda.  Spanish police have long been trying to snare him and came close to it in 2013 when they planned to arrest him at a party thrown by Romanov on the island of Mallorca. He never showed up and has evaded them ever since. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/14/4CA5614C00000578-5774477-image-a-21_1527341516486.jpg","title":"Parents three year old girl appalled preschool says wear sundress","story":"    Three-year-old Lola\u0027s sundress was labelled as \u0027inappropriate\u0027 by teachers  Lola showed off the dress during a TV interview in Canada but she cannot wear it for school\u0027They said that her dress was inappropriate for nursery school, and she needed to have two-inch wide straps on her sundress,\u0027 said Jamie Stonehouse to CTV.The problem began on Wednesday when temperatures in Winnipeg soared to more than 86F.  Lola\u0027s mum picked out the light dress from her daughter\u0027s closet and thought it looked perfect for the hot weather.But the school were less impressed and staff told the parents that if she wanted to wear the dress again, Lola would need to wear a t-shirt underneath it. The dress, which is pink and orange and has frills going down to the little girl\u0027s ankles.

The mistakes were obvious, we don\u0027t have to talk about that, it\u0027s all clear. he knows it, I know it, you all know it.

We did well to get the goal and get back into the game but we made mistakes and Real Madrid were really good. They\u0027re a fantastic side and will always hurt you, they deserved to win and were better on the night.\u0027The first 30 or 35 minutes, we dominated with the ball, had a couple of chances but it is frustrating. You have to give credit to them. \u0027When Mo Salah got injured they started to dominate with the ball. They scored a goal which was offside in the first half but we stayed in the game,\u0027 added Henderson.\u0027We still believed we could go on but there were a couple of goals on another night which would not have gone in.\u0027Real went ahead after the break when the ill-fated Karius threw the ball out towards forward Karim Benzema whose outstretched leg turned it into the unguarded goal.\u0027The first goal I am not sure what happened... and then the overhead kick he (Karius) could do nothing about. The third goal, the ball had loads of movement on it. It is not the mistakes Loris Karius made, we got to the final as a team and lose as a team. It is about everybody.\u0027We were not good enough on the night, and I am so proud of the players and the fans who came out for us on the night.

After his substitution, Liverpool did not have another shot at goal for the remainder of the first half which remains 0-0.           Salah was left flying and came down heavily on his shoulder which forced his replacement on with at least an hour remaining          Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp tried to console the distraught Salah as he left the field after only 30 minutes Liverpool fans outnumbered  Real Madrid\u0027s following in the 63,000-capacity crowd.Both teams\u0027 fan anthems were played before kickoff and the red scarves of Liverpool fans peppered one corner of the end occupied by Madrid supporters during \u0027You\u0027ll Never Walk Alone.\u0027The game kicked off with Liverpool fans\u0027 current Champions League song, \u0027Allez, Allez, Allez,\u0027 booming around the Olympic Stadium in Kiev. Both teams were allocated more than 16,000 tickets for the game.But Liverpool fans appeared to secure additional tickets from other sources.           Spirits appear high in Kiev\u0027s Shevchenko Park, where thousands of Liverpool fans have gathered in the sunshine ahead of the Champions League final kick-off against Real Madrid.

UK car production rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 1970s and today provides more than 800,000 jobs in Britain.Why, then, am I filled with a sense of foreboding? Quite simply because I fear hardline Brexiteers are in danger of achieving what that rabble of militant trade unions failed to do: destroying the British car industry.In fact, I am even more worried than I was back then, when at least I could help fix the part of the industry I ran myself. Today, our fate lies in the hands of politicians whose negotiations threaten not just our own business but the whole British economy.Revealed: How letting an ambulance past can land motorists...Gardeners\u0027 World guest is accused of racism for calling the...Share this articleThat’s not just my view. I can assure you that the leaders of all the other big automotive firms agree that we are in real danger of damaging an industry we have spent decades rebuilding.At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril.Why? Allow me to explain. One of the biggest reasons the automotive industry failed in the 1970s is that supply chains were seriously disrupted and completely unpredictable, so costs soared and quality deteriorated.Modern supply chains need to be super-efficient. The car industry has been described as the most complex organisation of human endeavour on the planet, which is not surprising when you consider that there are more than 20 million variations of, for example, a Range Rover. Precisely the correct part must be available at the right time when the car moves down the production line.          At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril (file image)For example a red, right- hand, heated, electronic wing mirror must arrive for car number one and then, for car number two, a blue one with a different specification.These components come from all over the world, with the vast majority being sourced outside Europe. Car supply chains are particularly at risk of delay because 60 per cent of parts are imported. That equates to more than a thousand delivery lorries from the Continent to the UK every day.Take fuel tanks, for instance. People don’t stop to think about them, but of course you can’t get a car off a production line without one. Half of all the cars made in Britain rely on fuel tanks that come from Unipart’s factories in this country.It takes a long, long time to design and develop each tank. They are sophisticated and complex products with multiple components coming from continental Europe. All that could be thrown into expensive disarray if just one component is not there when we need it.The idea that we could start sourcing all the components for the fuel tanks in the UK just doesn’t work. We would love to, but it isn’t possible – if it were, we would already be doing it.The issue here is not one of border tariffs. The hard Brexiteers say that since German manufacturers want to sell their cars to us in the UK, there is no incentive for them to try to impose heavy tariffs after Brexit. Perhaps so. But that’s not the real problem.Tariffs hurt competitiveness and we don’t like that, but at least we can plan for them because they are quantifiable and predictable. Delays at border checkpoints, however, are disastrous precisely because they are so unpredictable.If we don’t know where a part is because it is stuck on a lorry in Europe and can’t get across the border, or they haven’t trained enough customs officials yet, then we have no certainty when it will arrive. The industry operates efficient ‘just-in-time’ practices so stock is not left lying around. That means we would normally have only enough parts at customers’ factories to keep the production lines running for just eight hours.But if the right part isn’t there when it is needed, you either have to send the car on and rework it afterwards, which is expensive and hurts quality, or you have to stop the production line. And that is very expensive, costing more than £1 million an hour – all for the sake of that single missing component.If we barrel headlong towards a hard Brexit, I fear such border delays are not only possible but inevitable, with the result that I believe the British motor industry will find it very difficult to survive in the long term.The hard Brexiteers prefer to avoid discussion of such practicalities, with talk of the UK forging new trade deals outside the EU. But again, it is more complex than that.For instance, a free-trade agreement with South Korea currently requires that cars we manufacture in the UK for export to Korea have 55 per cent of ‘local content’.Under the current rules, British-based car firms are allowed to count all EU components as being of local origin, even though only 25 per cent of them are typically sourced here. With a hard Brexit, I am not sure we can do that any longer, so the deal simply doesn’t work.Now do you understand why automotive bosses like me are so worried?But this is not just about the survival of firms such as mine, it is about the pounds in your pocket. The car industry benefits the UK economy to the tune of £200 billion a year and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs.Many people don’t realise that if the car industry fails, the economy will go with it. No one voted in the referendum to lose their jobs or their income.So what, then, can be done to avoid looming disaster. At the minimum, we must stay in the customs union. If the hard Brexiteers can find a credible and executable alternative, which deliver the same results, we need to see the evidence. There has been none so far.To press ahead without such a frictionless trade deal in place would be an act of wanton self-destruction.How tragic it would be if we had saved the British car industry from the grip of one damaging political ideology in the militant 1970s, only to lose it to another in 2018. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/14/4984EB0700000578-0-image-m-67_1519396707285.jpg","title":"Terrifying moment military jet flies just 90ft paraglider","story":"    The Royal Navy Hawk T1 flew between the four paragliders while on a practice bombing run at an adjacent military rangeThen as the Hawk soared above him and below his colleagues, he says nervously: ‘Like a wild man.

The public now have until early July to vote for the victor.The golden Man Booker race celebrates the 50th year of Britain’s leading prize for fiction, taking a single title from each of those decades. Joining Mantel and Ondaatje are VS Naipaul’s In a Free State, which won the prize in 1971, Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively from 1987, and the American writer George Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo, which triumphed last year. Among the five judges of the Golden Booker are the poet Lemn Sissay, who chose from the winners of the 1980s, and the writer Robert McCrum, the Observer’s former literary editor, who tackled the 1970s.“The golden Booker is a stunt, of course, but a surprisingly worthwhile one,” said McCrum. “It’s a vindication of 50 years’ debate about the nature of so-called literary fiction. Prizes offer an odd kind of lit crit, but I’d say that almost all the novels the judges had to read, reread and consider have stood the test of time.”Sissay’s choice of Lively’s book, a story of loss and desire set around the time of the second world war, is perhaps the biggest surprise. He rejected some very famous titles indeed, including Anita Brookner’s Hotel du Lac, Kingsley Amis’s The Old Devils, Peter Carey’s Oscar and Lucinda, William Golding’s Rites of Passage and Thomas Keneally’s Schindler’s Ark. Salman Rushdie, who won the Booker prize with Midnight’s Children in 1981 and who is attending the Hay festival this year, also did not make the grade. Neither did Kazuo Ishiguro, the winner of the Nobel prize for literature last year and a Booker winner in 1989 for The Remains of the Day.The other three judges are Kamila Shamsie, whose new novel Home Fire is in the running for the women’s prize for fiction, the former Orange prize, and who assessed winners from the 1990s the broadcaster and novelist Simon Mayo, who picked the first of Mantel’s historical trilogy from the 2000s and the poet Hollie McNish, who selected last year’s Booker winner, Saunders’s melancholy story about Abraham Lincoln, from the current decade.The five judges were asked to read, or reread, each winner from their given decade before selecting what Man Booker is calling the golden five. All 51 winners since the prize was first awarded in 1969 are still in print – a vindication of the judges’ choices which can often prove controversial.McCrum said he was “quite passionate” about his choice of Naipaul’s novel, although he doubted it would do as well as Mantel or Ondaatje’s books in the popular voting stage. He picked In A Free State over three enduring titles by female authors: Nadine Gordimer’s The Conservationist, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s Heat and Dust and Iris Murdoch’s The Sea, The Sea.“If our shortlist of five were placed in a time capsule for re-examination in 2118, it would provide a surprisingly reliable snapshot of the novel in English, 1970-2010,” said McCrum.The five shortlisted books will now be put to a month-long public vote on the Man Booker prize website and the ultimate winner will be announced at the Man Booker 50 festival at the Southbank Centre in London on 8\u0026nbspJuly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acb48669c8258c5ab6b15ea5a315f42f36639d9c/0_192_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49c7e4b122bc6e407856b828ea363269","title":"proust women fin de siecle paris salons","story":"Two lost essays by Marcel Proust about Parisian high society at the fin de siècle are to be published in English for the first time following their discovery by an American scholar. Of particular significance to academics are their revelations that the great French novelist was exploring ideas for In Search of Lost Time, his autobiographical masterpiece, around 14 years earlier than previously thought.One essay was unknown, while the other was presumed lost. Both show that the author’s fascination with aristocratic salons and society doyennes developed long before 1913, when he published his seven-part classic of French literature, with the Guermantes family among fictional characters in a narrative about the decline and fall of an aristocratic ideal. One essay, The Great Parisian Salons, dates from 1893 when Proust was just 21, and runs to around 1,850 words. It had been completely overlooked until now because Proust had written it under the pseudonym Tout-Paris in Le Gaulois, a prestigious society journal.The essay was discovered by Caroline Weber in researching her book, Proust’s Duchess: How Three Celebrated Women Captured the Imagination of Fin-de-Siècle Paris.Commenting on The Great Parisian Salons, Weber told the Observer: “No one ever knew that Proust wrote the article. It’s brand new.”Weber, professor of French and Comparative Literature at Barnard College, Columbia University, said that other Proust scholars had not looked through early issues of Le Gaulois, even though Proust is known to have first written for the publication nine months later, using the same Tout-Paris pseudonym. “It’s really exciting. It was hiding in plain sight. It’s fascinating,” she said.Weber added that the two essays cast new light on the literary master. “They add texture and depth to our understanding of the genius this young man would one day become. He’s already deploying in these essays a few of the literary techniques that would later become associated with his mature style. The discovery of two previously unknown writings by him is made more interesting by the fact that these writings show him before he was famous.”Greffulhe was one of the three socialites who shaped Proust’s vision of noble glamour, the focus of Weber’s book. Weber found the second essay, The Salon of the Comtesse Greffulhe, 1902, which is around 3,000 words long, in an unmarked box in the Greffulhe family’s vast private archives.“The essay was supposed to run in Le Figaro, but Elisabeth Greffulhe had the article killed because her husband thought that such publicity was vulgar and he was not afraid to beat her up when she defied him,” said Weber.Her research also led to her solving a mystery that she claims has baffled critics and historians for 125 years – the identity of “the lady in grey”, the bewitching society belle who drove the celebrated novelist Guy de Maupassant – one of the young Proust’s literary heroes – to madness and eventual suicide.“Based on more archival documents that I uncovered, I have proven – I think conclusively – that another of my book’s three heroines, the man-slaying salonnière Geneviève Bizet Straus, whose illicit extramarital affair with Maupassant I\u0026nbsprecount, was the\u0026nbsp‘lady in grey’,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e922f7665467b27f7da168ff5e1b321069ea81ae/0_162_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=518e1aa46c3fa2f72e12770a4db478e3","title":"jeremy corbyn prime minister eu brexit october general election","story":"Unhappy Brexiteers could yet force an October general election, and open the way for the Labour leader to reshape BrexitThe idea that the British people are on the brink of “liberation” from the European Union is starting to look very odd indeed. The evidence increasingly suggests that by the middle of the next decade, we may very well still be fully bound by most of the key terms and conditions of EU membership.Yet while we may be obliged to accept EU laws and regulations affecting the single market and the customs union and still have to pay into the EU budget, the British people may notice one difference: we will have neither voice nor vote in determining European laws and regulations. We will be law-takers, not lawmakers.There is likely to be another serious inconvenience to doctrinaire Eurosceptics: the UK may not be able to actually implement any of the promised “amazing trade deals” with the rest of the world until the mid-2020s. In the meantime, it should be noted, Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand are indeed already busy finalising or negotiating some amazing new trade deals. But these are with the EU, not the UK.Legally, we are on course to leave the EU next March that’s when the period allowed under article 50 for negotiating the principles of a new relationship with the EU expires. We then have a further short period, until the end of 2020, to finalise a new, full-scale trade and cooperation treaty with Europe.The trouble is that – outside the May cabinet – no one any longer really believes in this sort of timetable. It is conceivable, but improbable, that the article 50 deadline could be extended by a very short period, but there will be serious legal problems to face. What is more likely is that the subsequent transition (or implementation period), during which the substance of a new treaty would have to be agreed, could be extended.UK customs experts have joined British business and industrial leaders in saying significantly more time will be needed before the UK would be anything like prepared for life outside the customs union and single market. Hence discussion of further proposed deadlines, ranging from the end of 2022 to around 2025.Two major political events in the UK could upend this kind of extended period of grace. The first is the possible collapse of the May government. This may not transpire, but no one can ignore the ever louder drumbeat from hardline Brexiteers that an October general election cannot be ruled out.What is beyond question is that it is a constitutional obligation for the next general election to be held no later than early summer 2022. Even at that stage, the UK may still be in a state of limbo in relation to the EU – bound by obligations, but deprived of democratic rights.In the event of an election this autumn, the focus would increasingly shift from how May can survive and complete the Brexit process to how a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would handle the Brexit process if elected. Indeed, in the event of an October election, he would have to make it clear how he would handle future talks with Brussels.He may state unambiguously that he wishes to reopen negotiations with Michel Barnier, the European council, and indeed the European parliament, at the earliest possible date. He could signal that a Labour government would approach these talks in a very different manner – and say that Labour wants to commit to the standards set by the EU in areas such as workers’ rights and social standards. Corbyn might also express readiness to back further strengthening of EU-wide environmental standards and democratic rights.In particular, as prime minister, there’s a good chance that Corbyn would support some of the reforms now promised by the European commission – notably the planned new European Labour Authority. More specifically, the mooted reforms of the posted workers directive – to close loopholes in free movement exploited by rogue employers to undermine local wages and labour conditions – would be attractive to Corbyn. As a Labour prime minister who pledged to end austerity and gross inequality, his government will have every interest in cooperating as closely as possible in a Europe-wide strategy for faster growth and job generation.For its part, the EU would have every interest in giving an incoming Labour government time to talk through these issues with Brussels – and perhaps an opportunity to put the results to parliament or the people for approval through a referendum.It is worth remembering that, before the 1975 EU referendum, Harold Wilson opposed the terms of the agreement which had been negotiated by Edward Heath’s Tory government. The resulting so-called “renegotiated agreement” was then endorsed in that referendum. A Corbyn “reform and remain” agreement would give voters a constructive alternative to being in the EU only for obligations, and out in terms of democracy and law-making rights.• John Palmer is a former European editor of the  and former political director of the European Policy Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4979022a17c008fdd63fca46e56bc3cacf8ef8d4/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0eea361f3df9ebd3235f7831908d711","title":"brexit six tests eu starmer corbyn","story":"Labour’s spokesman is taking us for fools. A party that stands up for working people cannot allow them to be hit hardest of allIt cannot be easy being Keir Starmer. A cerebral, rational lawyer with a forensic mind who entered politics just as populism was infecting it badly. A man used to executive authority, built more for government than opposition. With a place at the top table as shadow Brexit secretary but viewed on that issue, and much else, with considerable suspicion by true Corbynista believers in the leader’s inner circle. Having to forge a position that straddles the historic Euroscepticism of Jeremy Corbyn and the posh boy revolutionaries who surround him, the overwhelming pro-Europeanism of Labour members whom the leadership says it listens to, and the “will of the people” as expressed on one day in June 2016.It was these competing pressures that led Starmer and Corbyn to arrive at a position defined as “constructive ambiguity”. In Theresa May’s disastrous election campaign, the ambiguity seemed to work well. Leavers sensed Corbyn was basically on their side. Remainers saw Labour as the only credible route to blunt May’s push for hard Brexit. The party was able to shift the focus to other issues, and allow the elephant in the room to fade into the background.Constructive ambiguity was a phrase Tony Blair often used to describe our approach to negotiating peace in Northern Ireland. But there came a point, as he put it, when that strategy had to be replaced by “acts of completion”. Similarly, the latter-day version of constructive ambiguity has run its course and must be replaced by acts of decision.Just as the government is finally having to confront some difficult choices, so is Labour. And facing both ways will hold neither electoral appeal nor intellectual credibility, not least because Starmer set six tests against which he said May’s Brexit deal would be judged, and it is becoming ever clearer than none of them are being met.Does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? It will certainly be weaker and less collaborative than now.Does it deliver the “exact same benefits” as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union? No, and none of the deals on offer will do so.Does it ensure the fair management of migration in the interests of the economy and communities? Highly unlikely and, looking at the Windrush scandal, would we trust May to deal with the rights of EU migrants in Britain and UK migrants in Europe?Does it defend rights and protections and prevent a race to the bottom? A race to the bottom is precisely what many Brexiteers want.Does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime? Not according to anyone I know who is working in that field.Does it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK? No, and the government impact assessment papers make that perfectly clear.Even at this stage, it is impossible to imagine the deal that could be secured from the current “screwed-up … botched … delusional … shambles” – as the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings calls the negotiations – that would not be opposed by a “jobs first” Labour frontbench.As a hardcore remainer, who believes that if you believe something will damage the country you should seek to prevent it, I welcomed the Starmer tests precisely because I could see no way they would be met, and therefore no way Labour could support the Brexit put before parliament. Add a reasonably sized Tory rebellion to a Labour whip against a deal that failed to pass the tests, then the government is defeated, a crisis ensues and, who knows, it may suit May, and parliament, to put the deal to a people’s vote.However, though there seems to me to be a compelling logic that moves from failure to meet the tests to a three-line whip against the deal, it does not appear to be shared by the normally hyper-logical lawyer. Indeed, you will have to look long and hard to find him on the record as saying Labour will vote against a deal that fails to meet those tests. Refusing to support is not the same as opposing. And at last week’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, when Starmer projected himself as the driver of step-by-step shifts in Labour’s position, MPs such as Mary Creagh pointed out that it had taken persistent and steady rebellion to get the leadership to move at all.Though the MP Owen Smith was sacked for daring to voice opposition to one part of Labour’s Brexit strategy, Barry Gardiner survived, and continues to be one of the few Labour faces allowed on TV, despite dismissing the Starmer tests – surely the key plank of the strategy – as “bollocks”.But now Starmer himself has given the impression that Labour has no intention of using any vote in parliament this year to block a Brexit deal, even if it obviously fails his tests.“In my heart of hearts,” he told the Fabian Society, “I don’t think we’re going to know what “out” looks like until the end of the transition period. I really don’t. I wish I thought otherwise, but I don’t. I think that out will only come into full shape probably at the earliest 2021.”I always feared the transition was a trap and this suggests Labour intends fully to fall into it. This must be music to the ears of Brextremists who just want to get to March 2019, because they know that once the flag comes down there is no chance of it going back up again for a generation or more, whatever the mess that ensues.To compound the fault, Starmer spoke in the context of seeking to discourage supporters of a people’s vote on the final deal. So, if Labour will not vote against the deal in parliament, even if the tests are failed, and he won’t support a people’s vote on the deal, it puts Labour in much the same position as the government and the Brextremists within it. Whatever the costs, whatever the consequences, we are out. And the fine talk that “we would negotiate a better deal” will have to change tense subtly, and irrelevantly, to “we would have negotiated a better deal”.It leaves me with the uneasy feeling that Starmer is taking us for fools. He risks enabling Brexit without the people being given a final say on the deal on the utterly spurious grounds that no one will know the full consequences of leaving Europe until after we’ve left. A lawyer as good as Keir should be embarrassed to make such an argument. A Labour party that was founded to stand up for working people should be ashamed if it helps facilitate a hard Brexit that will hit those people hardest of all.Labour members deserve better than this. We deserve a party leadership that is willing to fight the Tories on their disastrous approach to Brexit and which does so in words of clarity and directness, full on.Jeremy Corbyn still has enough credibility and celebrity to get a great reception when speaking to students in Northern Ireland. But there is every danger of a hard border, which he insists will never be, materialising with the hard Brexit he is failing properly to oppose.The government is wide open to be torn apart on Brexit, which is shaping up to be biggest con job since the South Sea Bubble. A government that insists on pressing on with such a shoddy scheme will never be forgiven. But nor will an opposition that lets them get away with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c68a5c3f53f0154b32d1d17fbeb08beb24c8bd3/0_395_7288_4372/master/7288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f844e7239d5f3b7afa6398d34cbdccd","title":"yes repeal eighth amendment irish women inequality","story":"The Yes vote on abortion is a huge victory for humanity, for compassion, for empathyYes. Yes. Yes. Women, lovely women, the women of Ireland, have defeated those who hate us, fear us and wanted to keep us down. Overwhelmingly defeated them. The nightmare is over.This campaign hasn’t been for three months. It has been for 35 years. The relief, the joy, is almost indescribable. So this is what liberation feels like. I am crying, I am laughing. I am so, so proud.I was 26 in 1983 when feminists tried to stop the government from outrageously diminishing the humanity of women with the so-called anti-abortion amendment.My granny paid for more than one trip to England in our family. On Friday night, as the magnificent news of the exit polls came through, my 24-year-old daughter, home to vote, hugged me.Nine out of ten of her generation voted Yes. One of them tweeted that millennials in Ireland might never own property “but we’re sure as hell going to own our own bodies”. We tweeted a photo of us going in to vote, and Grannies 4 Equality liked it. The Father Ted jokes are great. The sun is shining.The anti-repeal side made out that women were marauding murderers. They tried to appropriate Irishness – they had a poster with our 1916 proclamation of independence on it, claiming that its signatories would want us to vote No.It was incredibly moving to see all the people surging through Dublin airport, some of them having made huge, expensive journeys back from every part of the world because they knew how momentous it was to be Irish at this moment, and with the chance to shake off all that old nonsense.The suffering caused by this amendment cannot be undone. Nor can the cruel history that led to it, the Magdalene Laundries, the mother and baby homes which tortured women and sold their babies. But this is the Yes that will enable Irish women to say No. No to all the other indignities and inequalities we still have to endure – the patriarchy has no idea what lies ahead now that we are actually going to own our own bodies. The North still has to be liberated – it has neither same-sex marriage nor abortion yet. But for now we are reeling. Ireland has said Yes. Passionately, lovingly, Yes.ps.

He talks masculinity, fame – and why he’s finally ready to play LearFor anyone who looks toward their later years with trepidation, Sir Anthony Hopkins (“Tony, please”) is a proper tonic. He is 79, and happier than he has ever been. This is due to a mixture of things: his relationship with his wife of 15 years, Stella, who has encouraged him to keep fit, and to branch out into painting and classical composition the calming of his inner fire, of which more later and his work.Hopkins loves to work. Much of his self-esteem and vigour comes from acting – “Oh, yes, work has kept me going. Work has given me my energy” – and he is in no way contemplating slowing down. You can feel a quicksilver energy about him, a restlessness. Every so often, I think he’s going to stop the interview and take flight, but actually he’s enjoying himself and keeps saying, “Ask me more! This is great!”We meet in Rome, where he is making a Netflix film about the relationship between the last pope (Benedict) and the current one (Francis). Hopkins is playing Benedict, Jonathan Pryce is Francis. He is enjoying this – “We’re filming in the Sistine Chapel tomorrow!” – and we are both relishing the lovely view across the city from the penthouse suite in the hotel where he’s staying. Still, he declares that the film we are here to talk about, the BBC’s King Lear, filmed in England and directed by Richard Eyre, is the piece of work that has made him truly happy. “I felt, ‘Yes, I can do this.’ I can do this sort of work. I didn’t walk away. And it’s so invigorating, because I know I can do it, and I’ve got my sense of humour, my humility, and nothing’s been destroyed.”He’s played the part before, at the National Theatre in 1986, with David Hare directing. “I was… ” – he counts in his head “… 48,” he says. “Ridiculous. I didn’t realise I was too young. I had no concept of how to do it. I was floundering.”Now, he feels he’s got Lear right, and few would disagree. In a star-studded cast – Emma Thompson plays Goneril Emily Watson, Regan Jim Broadbent, Gloucester Jim Carter, Kent Andrew Scott, Edgar – it’s Hopkins who dominates. He is fantastic: his white hair close-cropped, his manner like a heavy-headed bull, a scary tyrant losing his powers, a drinker who flips into terrifying rage.Hopkins’ theory is that Lear’s wife died giving birth to Cordelia, and Lear brought her up, his favourite, as a tomboy. Of the older two daughters, Emily Watson said, “and I agree with her, that they have become monsters, because he made them so”. Hopkins believes that Lear is terrified of women, can’t understand them. Hence the awful specificity of the curses he rains on his older daughters, damning their wombs. He seeks refuge in men, surrounding himself with a boisterous male army. The scenes where Lear wants to bring his retinue to Regan’s house are reminiscent of an awful, all-boys-together drink-fest.“I come from a generation where men were men,” Hopkins says. “There’s nothing soft or touchy-feely about any of us, where we were from in Wales. There’s a negative side to that, because we’re not very good at receiving love or giving it. We don’t understand it. After Richard Burton died, his brother Graham invited me to the Dorchester where they were all having a get-together, the wives and the men, all the sisters and brothers. All pissed. And I noticed the women were sipping their ports and brandy, but all the men were, ‘Come on, drink! Drink!’ I thought, ‘There’s something very Greek about this.’ Men together. You know, like the bouzouki dancers. It’s not homosexuality, but it is a sexuality, a kind of bonding. That’s what I was thinking of.”Hopkins often uses his past to find his way into a character. Small incidents that stick in his mind, real people who inform. In the scene with Kent, Edgar and the Fool, as Lear descends into madness, he has all three line up on a bench and addresses them with the wrong names. Hopkins decided that Lear had seen his father drown three puppies when he was young and believed his friends to be those dogs. “Cruelty to an animal stays with you for the rest of your life,” he says. “I once witnessed something like that, but I can’t think of it too much, it’s too upsetting. But that little kernel of an event doesn’t go. It grows with you.” When he portrays deliberately scary people – such as Hannibal Lecter or Robert Ford in the Westworld series – he plays them quietly, emphasising their sinister control. His Lear, though, is explosive. “He’s completely bonkers – he laughs at the storm. That’s what I like about him.”In the film, Hopkins uses a horseshoe as his crown. He asked a friend, Drew Dalton, a props guy on Westworld who is also an Idaho farmer, to get it for him, and he told him it was from an old horse, born in 1925. When Hopkins talks about this horse, he gets a little teary. “I carry the horseshoe with me wherever I go now. I still get emotional about it – the power, and the loneliness, and the pain of that horse. That’s Lear.”Tears come easily to him, especially when he talks about hard work, old age, masculinity. His father, Dick, was a baker, a tough, practical man, born of another baker. But, Hopkins says, as he got older, small things would upset him, “like if he made a mistake in his car and drove off a ramp instead of getting it just right, he’d break down crying. Towards the end of his life, he used to drink, and he was unpredictable. Never violent, but sudden turns of rage, and then deep depressions. Turned on my mother, turned on me. I was old enough, so it didn’t bother me. We didn’t speak much before he died. He resented me for something. I understood it, I could get it, and I thought, ‘What a terrible, lonely horror, for people at the end of their lives.’”It’s easy to see how he drew on this for Lear. Hopkins has a daughter, too, Abigail, from his first marriage, but they don’t have a relationship, so there was no inspiration there. “No. I accepted it years ago. It’s her choice and she must live her life. I say to young people, ‘If your parents are giving you trouble, move out.’ You’ve got to let go. You don’t have to kill your parents, but just leave if it’s holding you back.”Lear came out of another BBC film, an adaptation of Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser, also directed by Eyre and broadcast in 2015. Hopkins was the ageing, belligerent actor Sir, who is preparing to play Lear Ian McKellen was Norman, his dresser. Hopkins had wanted to do the play since picking up a copy in a bookshop in Los Angeles, where he lives: “It opened the valves of nostalgia.”When he first became involved in the theatre, in the late 1950s, Hopkins was a stage manager, touring northern towns, meeting “old, wrecked, alcoholic, wonderful” vaudeville comedians who’d worked during the war, talking to stage hands who knew the technique of dropping the curtain for comedy (fast) and tragedy (very slow). Then he joined the National in the time of Olivier and Gielgud. He was impatient for success. “Oh,” he says, “I had nonspeaking parts, messengers and God knows what, and I was very disgruntled, because I wanted to be bigger. So I went to the casting director and said, ‘Who do you have to sleep with to get a part around here?’ I’d only been there three weeks!”The casting director was taken aback, but mentioned him to Olivier, who gave him a part as an IRA man in Juno And The Paycock. Hopkins knows now that his hubris was ludicrous, but he was anxious to get to the action, and still is. “I think, with life, just get on with it, you know?” he says. “We’re all going to die, and that’s a great motivator.”He’s always called himself a loner – “alone, loner, solitary”, he says to me – and in past interviews his outsiderdom has become almost his headline characteristic. But he and McKellen bonded, regaling each other with old stories instead of rehearsing. Having felt, for all those years, unwanted by the establishment, the establishment was making him welcome. He also realised that he wanted to do Lear for real.Not on stage, though. Despite his nostalgia, Hopkins hates the theatre. In 1973, he walked out of Macbeth mid-run at the National and moved to LA. The last stage play he was in was M Butterfly, in the West End in 1989. It was a torment, he says, the tipping point being a matinee where nobody laughed, “not a titter”. When the lights came up, the cast realised the entire audience was Japanese. “Oh God,” he recalls. “You’d go to your dressing room and someone would pop their head round the door and say, ‘Coffee? Tea?’ And I’d think, ‘An open razor, please.’”He can’t stand being unproductive, working without a point it drives him mad. David Hare once told Hopkins he’d never met anyone as angry: “And this was when I was off the booze!” He gave up drinking in 1975. For a while, he tried to quieten down his personality (“I was ever so careful”), but his mother told him it wasn’t working. “She said, ‘Why don’t you just be the bastard that you really are?’ She said, ‘I know what you’re like, you’re a monster.’ I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘Well, OK then, be a monster.’“But the anger, you begin to channel it,” he says. “I’m very happy I’m an alcoholic – it’s a great gift, because wherever I go, the abyss follows me. It’s a volcanic anger you have, and it’s fuel. Rocket fuel. But of course it can rip you to pieces and kill you. So, gradually, over the years, I have learned not to be a people-pleaser. I don’t have a temper any more. I get impatient, but I try not to judge. I try to live and let live. I don’t get into arguments, I don’t offer opinions, and I think if you do that, then the anger finally begins to transform into drive.”Now, if he’s not acting, he paints, or plays the piano. He released an album of classical compositions, Composer, performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2011, which was well-received. “Hopkins writes with considerable flair and confidence,” said one critic, while Amazon gives it four stars. He began painting at the behest of Stella, who saw how he decorates his scripts. He goes over his lines around 250 times, until he can recite them backwards, sideways, in his sleep. Every time he reads them, he draws a doodle on his script, and the doodles, which start as small crosses, grow enormously large, covering all the blank space. Stella saw this and got him to paint “favours”, little presents for their wedding guests.“She said, ‘Well, if they don’t work, no one’s going to put you in jail,’” he says. And nobody did, because his paintings are pretty fine they sell for thousands of dollars. He shows me some on his phone. They’re expressionist, full of bright colours – “South American colours: Stella is Colombian” – and he’s working towards a show next year in St Petersburg, which he’s very excited about.“Ask me more questions!” he says. He doesn’t want to waste time sitting around while the photographer sets up. We talk animals. He and Stella collect stray cats and dogs. We talk politics. He doesn’t care about Trump he doesn’t vote. He takes a widescreen approach to politics, because focusing on the detail makes him too unhappy. “I don’t vote because I don’t trust anyone. We’ve never got it right, human beings. We are all a mess, and we’re very early in our evolution. Look back throughout history: you have the 20th century, the murder of 100 million people, barely 80 years ago. The 1914-18 war, the civil war in America, slaughter, bloodshed… I don’t know if there’s a design in it, but it is extraordinary to look at it and get a perspective. I think, ‘Well, if it’s the end, there’s nothing we can do about it, and it’ll blow over, whatever happens.’”He remembers talking to his father on the phone during the Cuban missile crisis (“and I was a raving Marxist then”) and his father remarking that the bomb would be dropped on London, so Hopkins would be all right, “because the bomb will drop on you, so you won’t know much about it. But in Wales, we’ll suffer the fallout.” His dad also once said to him, about Hitler and the second world war, “Six years later, he was dead in a bunker. So much for the Third Reich”, which makes me laugh.Now he avoids news and politics, for his peace of mind. “In America, they’re obsessed with healthy food,” he says. “They tell you, if you eat junk food, you get fat and you die. Well, television is run by money and corporate power and sponsorship. It’s junk food for the brain. Toxic.” If he’s not busy, he orders books online and sends them to friends – Wake Up And Live! by Dorothea Brande, The Life-Changing Magic Of Not Giving A F**k by Sarah Knight – or watches old films and TV on his iPad. He was obsessed with Breaking Bad, and wrote a lovely letter to Bryan Cranston extolling his acting now, he likes watching Midsomer Murders, The Persuaders and Rosemary \u0026amp Thyme.We talk a bit about the #MeToo movement. Hopkins says, about Harvey Weinstein, “I did know about the person you are referring to, about his sexual stuff. I know he is a rude man and a tyrant. But I avoided him, I didn’t want anything to do with people like that. Bullies.” And actually, despite his desire to live and let live, Hopkins often calls bullies out: when John Dexter, the director of M Butterfly, started shouting at everyone in the cast, Hopkins told him to stop. “I said, ‘John, you don’t need to do this. You’re a great director. Stop it.’ And he cried. I mean, I understand if people are bullies. They’ve got their problems. I can’t judge them, I won’t make fun of them at awards. It’s correct for women to stand up for themselves, because it’s unacceptable. But I don’t have a desire to dance on anyone’s grave.”He understands that we can all be terrible, and we can all be kind. Fame and power have nothing to do with it. I tell Hopkins something the singer Tony Bennett once said – “Life teaches you how to live it if you live long enough” – and he is delighted. “How extraordinary. What an amazing thing to say! You know, I meet young people, and they want to act and they want to be famous, and I tell them, when you get to the top of the tree, there’s nothing up there. Most of this is nonsense, most of this is a lie. Accept life as it is. Just be grateful to be alive.”He shows me a picture on his phone. It’s of him aged three, with his dad on a beach near Aberavon. His dad is grinning. Hopkins is a cherubic child, with golden curls, caught somewhere between laughing and crying. “I was upset because I’d dropped a cough sweet.” He keeps it because it reminds him of how far he’s come.“I think, ‘Good God, I should be in Port Talbot.’ Either dead, or working in my father’s bakery. For some inexplicable reason I’m here, and none of it makes sense. And I look at him and I say, ‘We did OK, kid.’”• King Lear is on BBC2 on Monday 28 May.Commenting on this piece?

Both players were reduced to tears while Real Madrid celebrated a third consecutive Champions League triumph.Salah left the Olimpiyskiy Stadium with his left shoulder in a sling having been forced out of the final in the 30th minute following a challenge by Sergio Ramos. Klopp described Ramos’s challenge as “harsh”, with the Real captain holding Salah’s arm as he dragged him to the ground, and admitted the Egypt international could miss the World Cup. Liverpool’s leading scorer was taken to hospital after the game while the squad flew home to Merseyside.“It was a big moment in the game,” said Klopp, who congratulated Zinedine Zidane’s team on their victory. “I know if you say something like that after you’ve lost, you sound like a bad loser. But for me that was kind of a harsh challenge because the arm is there and it was like wrestling a little bit.“It was very bad for Mo, very bad for us, very bad for Egypt. That’s part of the sport I don’t like, but things like this can happen. I don’t know what would have happened had Mo played on, we will never know that. Everybody saw in the first half-hour we were the opponent they probably will have expected. We played good football but we lost 3-1 so I don’t think in 10 years people will talk about that. The other decisive moments were the goals. They were quite strange.”Salah’s injury was not the only decisive moment to go against Liverpool. Karius handed Karim Benzema the opening goal and, while he could do nothing about Gareth Bale’s stunning overhead kick, he also let a shot from the Wales international slip through his grasp.Karius spoke to Talksport after the game: “I don’t feel anything right now. Today I lost my team the game and I feel sorry for everyone. I’m sorry for everyone - from the team, from the whole club - that the mistakes cost dearly.“If I could go back in time, I would. I feel sorry for my team,” he continued. “I know I let them down today. It’s very hard right now but that’s the life of a goalkeeper. You have to get your head up again. These goals cost us the title, basically.”Karius apologised to Liverpool fans in the stadium after the final whistle and, though few of his team-mates offered consolation on the pitch, Klopp insisted the club would stand by the young German.“I have only had very few words after the game,” the manager said. “It’s really hard for him and I really feel for him. Nobody wants that. The mistakes were obvious. We don’t have to talk about them. He knows it, I know it, you all know it. Now he has to deal with it, we have to deal with it and we will do that. We will be with him, no doubt about that. It was not his night, obviously.”The defeat was Klopp’s sixth consecutive cup final defeat and he said Salah’s injury made the latest all the more painful. He explained: “I am not fine. I’m the opposite of fine. I have lost games in my life before so I know how to deal with that but you cannot avoid the feeling the night after the game. We all feel really, really bad and the trip home will not be the best trip we’ve ever had in our lives.“We wanted everything and got minus something with the injury of Mo. We didn’t win the final, we lost a very important player and Egypt maybe lost a very important player for the World Cup. I hope it’s not like this. I have no idea exactly but the medical department … what they said so far it doesn’t look really good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee77133970adf6fe1940076acab3717da85f46eb/0_60_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4e788baed72bdb692f5cca55830dca9","title":"real madrid liverpool champions league final match report","story":"It was an epic night, filled with so many different storylines, and unfortunately for Liverpool’s accident-prone goalkeeper, Loris Karius, he will have to live with the fact that his part will be remembered for just as long as, or possibly longer than, Gareth Bale’s spectacular bicycle kick or the tears from Mohamed Salah.For Bale it was a personal triumph with two of Real Madrid’s goals and a man-of-the-match award from a final he did not enter until the 61st minute. His flying, acrobatic volley, only two minutes after coming on, will go straight into the list of the greatest all-time goals in a Champions League final and put Madrid, with their 13th triumph, on their way to emulating the great Ajax and Bayern Munich teams of the 1970s with a third successive win.That, however, tells only part of the story from a night when Karius was a danger to his own team, responsible for Madrid’s two other goals and last seen wandering aimlessly around the pitch – alone, distraught and clearly traumatised – to ask forgiveness, hands clasped, from the thousands of Liverpool supporters. Karius looked broken. He chose a bad night to be so vulnerable and Liverpool will always wonder what might have happened if the German had not turned the night into his own personal ordeal. Or, indeed, if they had not lost Salah, half an hour in, with the shoulder injury that turned the match in Madrid’s favour.Salah looked inconsolable as he was led from the pitch and Sergio Ramos had some nerve offering a sympathetic hug on the way off. Ramos had locked Salah’s right arm and turned him, judo-style, as they lost balance going for the same ball. Television replays hardened the suspicion it was a calculated move on Ramos’s part and, when Salah landed with a hell of a thud, the damage was considerable. That blow could conceivably put the Egyptian out of the World Cup, too.His absence was a grievous setback for Liverpool, who had looked the more dangerous team until that point, and it would not be sour grapes for the losers to think that was the moment the game started to swing away from them. They had started so thrillingly but all their early momentum was lost once Salah went off. It never properly came back and the players in red took a long time – too long, probably – to adjust to being without the man who had scored 44 times over a record-breaking season. Without Salah, they never looked so threatening again.Ultimately, though, the difficult truth for Liverpool, and the tragic Karius, is that two of the goals they conceded were almost beyond comprehension, and how many times has Jürgen Klopp been warned this team risks being undermined by the lack of an elite goalkeeper? Karius has too much previous for this to be considered a one-off and, as goalkeeping mistakes go, his errors in the 51st and 83rd minutes were as bad as one another. In fact, they were not just bad. They were appalling, so wretched it was difficult to recall a worse goalkeeping performance in any major final through the years.His meltdown – for that is exactly what it was – started with the opening goal when he came to the edge of his penalty area to collect a ball that Toni Kroos, trying to set Karim Benzema free, had overhit. All Karius had to do was pick up the ball and roll it to Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right of defence. He got the second part horribly wrong, as if unaware that Benzema was still lurking, and the striker was able to flick out a boot to intercept the underarm throw. That was all it needed and, almost in slow motion, the ball trickled into an exposed goal.Liverpool’s equaliser came within four minutes. James Milner swung the ball over from a corner on the right and Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s most dangerous player, was alive in the six-yard area. Dejan Lovren won the header and, when Mané flashed his shot past Keylor Navas, it seemed as though Klopp’s team might have the momentum again.Instead Zinedine Zidane turned to Bale, playing possibly his final game for Madrid, and it was an incredible way in which the Welshman announced his presence – a twisting, mid-air bicycle kick to redirect Marcelo’s left-wing cross and flash the ball into Liverpool’s net. Zidane against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002? Mario Mandzukic for Juventus in 2017? Bale’s effort belongs in the same category. There was even applause from Liverpool’s fans when it was replayed on the giant screens.At 2-1 Liverpool came back again and Mané, in particular, kept threatening, fizzing a low shot against the post. Yet Bale was clearly emboldened by his first goal and, when he let fly again from 40 yards, the ball swerved in front of Karius and went through the goalkeeper’s hands. Perhaps Karius’s confidence had been damaged by the earlier mistake. Maybe the swerve was deceptive. At this level, however, there can be no excuses for such a mistake and, in that exact moment, everyone inside the Olimpiyskiy Stadium must have known there was no way back for Liverpool. If anything, they were fortunate not to suffer more damage in the second half. Madrid could also look back on Isco hitting the crossbar and there was an extraordinary moment when Cristiano Ronaldo was shaping to shoot only to be interrupted by a pitch invader from the end where the Madridistas were going through their victory songs.For the most part Liverpool had contained Ronaldo and Klopp’s team had often played well, particularly before Salah’s injury. The problem was that their goalkeeper had the worst night of his professional life. It was a sixth successive defeat for Klopp in a major final and at the final whistle, with Karius burying his face into the turf, there was not exactly a stampede of team-mates wanting to console him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb787af3d20119b41b7d666ca0bd0bed3ebd1ee/0_497_3025_1815/master/3025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9851d2c4900c150eaf98e2c289d2a303","title":"real madrid liverpool champions league final player ratings","story":"Substitute Gareth Bale is man of the match while Loris Karius’s howlers surely leave his Liverpool career in tattersKeylor Navas 710 Lucky not to be punished by Van Dijk when he missed a corner but one his safer goalkeeping displays.

Knew what he was doing when he dragged down Mohamed Salah but, as a defender, the captain was completely dominant.Marcelo 810 Made a convincing start to his duel with Salah before that headache departed. Was given more licence to attack and prospered but slow to react for Mané’s equaliser.Luka Modric 710 Given little time and space to dictate play due to the industry of Milner and Henderson. Tidy as always but only got into harmful areas when the game opened up.Casemiro 710 The unheralded but key part of this Real Madrid team performed effectively and diligently as usual, helping to curb Firmino’s influence on the Liverpool display.Toni Kroos 610 Operated too deep throughout the final and that left Ronaldo and Benzema isolated too often as a consequence. His passing was below its usual standard, too.Isco 610 Always searched for openings but could not get involved enough.

Superb tackle on Ronaldo stopped a certain goal.Georginio Wijnaldum 610 The most inventive of Liverpool’s midfield trio but could not get on the ball often enough truly to hurt his opponents. Drove the team forward to the end.Jordan Henderson 610 Neat and careful on the ball and worked hard defensively to prevent Isco having an influence on the final but unable to stamp his authority on the game.James Milner 710 His set-piece deliveries were Liverpool’s most potent weapon once Salah had gone.

At the Liverpool end, they were stunned, and they were not alone. The goal that won the European Cup had to be watched twice and they still couldn’t believe it even the replay on the giant screen didn’t entirely shake them out of it. For the second time, they were left wondering if that had really happened. The first time was surreal, the second sublime. Gareth Bale had been on the pitch for only two minutes when he took flight. High in the Kiev sky, he connected with a wonderful overhead kick.Bale ran to the corner and threw himself to the turf, sliding face-down. Cristiano Ronaldo followed his team-mates over to the Welshman. On the far touchline Zinedine Zidane could barely believe it. He scored the winning goal in the 2002 European Cup final at Hampden Park, a volley that became emblematic. When Ronaldo scored an overhead kick in Turin in the quarter-final this year, Juventus’s fans had stood to applaud. Afterwards Zidane had been asked about it. “Mine was nicer,” he smiled, a twinkle in his eye.Even he may admit that Bale’s was better. Just as even Karim Benzema may admit that his goal was the worst he has scored – even as it may be the most important, his first in a European Cup final. Between them, they had taken Madrid to a third title in a row, history made. For Bale, it is his fourth Champions League title since moving to Spain. It may well be his last. If so, this was some way to bid farewell. Or perhaps it can be a new beginning. It was, after all, a moment beyond the reach of the plausible, like something out of a\u0026nbspcomic.Now the European Cup final had a moment worthy of it. Until then, and speaking of comic, the final had been marked by two moments. Loris Karius throwing the ball against Benzema’s boot and into the net and, before that, Sergio Ramos dragging Mohamed Salah to the ground, forcing him out of this final and seeming to change the game entirely. Even if Liverpool did find an equaliser, thus requiring Zidane to call on Bale. So, on he came, to score the decisive second.And then, with a few minutes left, to get the third. Scorer in Lisbon, successful in the shootout in Milan, he had done it again in Ukraine. Twice. The shot looped and slipped through Karius’s hands. The goalkeeper was embarrassed, Bale didn’t care, leaping in the other corner now. Here he was on the pitch, his moment, his final – one he had not even started.Bale’s absence from the starting XI was not out of keeping with his season: it had started on Valentine’s Day, when he was left out against Paris Saint-Germain, an unexpected decision which was soon revealed as no one-off, not least because of the sense that he did little to rebel when he came on, seeming instead to disengage. In the second leg he was again left on the bench. In Turin it was the same and although he started the second leg, he was withdrawn at half-time, with the team 2-0 down. He withdrew at full-time too, while his team-mates celebrated. “I had to do something,” Zidane said afterwards. But, Bale wondered, did it have to be that? There had been no explanation, no conversation he and Zidane did not talk.Against Bayern Munich there was more of the same. Madrid had made it to the final but he had played only 99 of 540 minutes in the knockout phases. And yet his performance in Villarreal last week, widely assumed to be a dress rehearsal, the gathering speed and the specifics of Liverpool, had brought him back into a focus, a candidate to be included from the start for the final. Instead, it was the same XI that began in Cardiff in last year’s final, Benzema beginning ahead of him then, Bale was injured here there was no excuse. No consolation, either – that would come later.When Madrid’s subs came out to warm up, the Welshman did not join them. That is not so abnormal but as a staging of his separateness it is still striking. He too has become resigned to the probability of a departure. Bale, though, knew that there might always be a chance, that at least things could go the right way. Liverpool knew that Madrid could change the game from the bench in a way that they could not.In victory Bale said he was “obviously very disappointed not to start the game, so the best I could do was come on and make an impact – and that’s what I did. It has to be the best goal I’ve ever scored. Just happy to get the win. We know what we’ve achieved and how good we’ve been. We let everyone else speak, we know how hungry and determined we are and we showed it again today.”Asked about a return to the Premier League, he said: “I need to be playing week-in, week-out and that hasn’t happened this season for one reason or another. I have to sit down in the summer and discuss my future with my agent and take it from there.”A couple of months ago it had been suggested to him that for all that he had not been playing, for all that he had thought his time at Madrid was coming to an end, and that much as he would not start in Kiev, he would come on and win the final. Even if he had believed it, he would not have imagined it like this. An overhead kick, a long shot that Karius dropped into the net, and a fourth European Cup. No Briton has won more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38358fdf7bafb2a64f88153127a163e4049147b7/761_117_1754_1053/master/1754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8e90caf6ce90c12fac246003da7a4a9","title":"liverpool mohamed salah cruel end real madrid sergio ramos champions league","story":"What did Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos intend when grabbing the Egyptian’s arm? He might say he was reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive approach. Either way Salah was doneAnd fade to white. By the end of a messy, thrilling, occasionally grisly Champions League final in Kiev the most unexpected note was that Liverpool’s fearless run to this stage should end with regrets and a quiver of what might have been.It seemed even crueller still that the final image of Mo Salah’s joyful season should be the sight of the Premier League player of the year leaving the pitch in tears with half an hour gone. But then there are reasons why Real Madrid win these games, why the same faces keep on being framed by the cameras year after year lifting that intoxicatingly shiny trophy. Or in other words: Mo, meet Sergio.Madrid were the story here: three-times champions, with victory capped by an overhead kick from Gareth Bale of such devastating grace that even the Liverpool end offered him a ripple of bruised applause as Madrid lined up for the restart.Yet there will be a sense through red-tinted spectacles of having been cheated by fate, by misfortune and by Sergio Ramos.Make no mistake Liverpool had their moments to take this game by the scruff, most obviously in the opening quarter when they went for the full, blitz attack, drawing stumbles and stutters and hoofed clearances as those princely white shirts looked a little giddy. Liverpool can do this to you, swarming in with the body shots, taking your breath, making the pitch spin. Something had to give. It did. The wrong thing.Nobody will ever really know what Ramos intended as he grabbed Mo Salah’s arm and tumbled to the ground. No foul was awarded, even with Salah lying in agony holding his shoulder. Probably this was simply an innocent coming-together. In slow motion it looked like an expert secret service judo move, the kind of thing you spend three years learning to pull off in a camp in the Swiss Alps, along wth the blow dart to the neck and the sword-stick umbrella jab.Ramos might say he was giving some back in kind, reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive style. Either way Salah was done, soldiering on for a few moments before going down in distress clutching a dislocated shoulder. Ramos, svengali of white-shirted bastardism, loves these games. Here he seized another by the throat and squeezed at the vital moment.Instantly the weather inside the stadium changed. The excellent Sadio Mané was switched from the left where he had been traumatising Dani Carvajal. The red shirts seemed winded – and within six minutes of half-time Madrid were in front, Loris Karius producing a gut-wrenching error, placing the ball on the end of Karim Benzema’s foot in front of an open goal from a simple throw-out.Liverpool did not let it drop. Four minutes later they were level, Mané nipping in at a corner to poke the ball past Keylor Navas, drawing a vast cheer at that end and another note in the pure pleasure that has soundtracked this run to Kiev and which will remain even now the dominant note of a lost May weekend in Ukraine.What is black and white and red all over? Kiev of course. Or at least it was for one sun-drenched afternoon as Liverpool’s travelling support added a great sweaty replica-shirted smear of red to the washed out greens and blues and greys.They came in vans and coaches and cars. They came via Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Throughout the day they packed Shevchenko park with a bobbing, burping, chanting mass of sun-flushed flesh and filled the side-street bars with a travel-frazzled sense of Soviet-tinged dolce vita.As the minutes ticked down to kick-off there was a familiar feeling of ravenousness and an impatience around the pre-match hoopla, capped by the massed kitchen foil-clad dancers of the great Dua Lipa, who eventually appeared bouncing gamely on top of a blue and yellow birthday cake stage.Even with Salah off, this game was still there. Mané hit the post. Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled manfully with Marcelo, sniping inside like a horribly malevolent giant tarantula. But without that glaze of genius, the switch of gear that Salah brings, Madrid were able to purr forward.Still it took another painful howler from Karius to kill the game as he let a Bale shot spill through the most brittle of pasta-wristed punches. This was a professional tragedy for a footballer in the biggest match of his life, on a stage to which he will surely never return.But it was also not entirely surprising. Jürgen Klopp persuaded Karius to sign for Liverpool in the first place, then made him his number one. At the end of which, and when it really matters, Karius has made a pair of match-killing howlers. Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Kiev and beyond, the sun continues to rise, dogs still bite postmen, brown bears still seek out the treeline when nature calls. A new goalkeeper looked like an essential summer signing even before tonight.The intersection of luck and design is always a difficult area in sport. Here Liverpool could only bring on a half-fit Adam Lallana for Salah. Madrid could call on Bale, Salah’s equivalent as a player but able to lurk potently on the bench.Liverpool will leave Kiev a little bruised but also with a sense that their one real shot at this game, that full-throttle Plan A, was derailed in the coldest fashion by a more seasoned, powerfully stocked team of champions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f32e9484dccd600b0df239cb1a6eed1769b8072/0_33_4636_2782/master/4636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3883dc4d6ce0e092d79be618ffdeabd4","title":"real madrid v liverpool champions league final 2018 live","story":"Real won their third consecutive Champions League on an emotional night that will be remembered for Mo Salah’s heartbreak, Gareth Bale’s amazing goal and two hideous mistakes by Loris Karius“The Champions League should be called the CR7 Champions League”PS Here’s Cristiano Ronaldo’s wonderfully absurd reaction to Real’s victory, as published by Marca. Who was the top scorer once again? The Champions League should change and be called the CR7 Champions League. I have won five and I am the top goalscorer again, so I cannot be sad.That’s about it for tonight’s blog. It’s been a tough night for Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp wanted them to play brave, big balls football – and they did, dominating the match until Mo Salah’s heartbreaking injury after half an hour. That changed the mood of the match, and then poor Loris Karius made a big, big balls of the second half to give away two goals either side of Gareth Bale’s staggering overhead kick.Congratulations to Real, commiserations to Liverpool. I’ll leave you with Daniel Taylor’s match report. Thanks for your company goodnight.Here are Andy Hunter’s player ratings from Kiev. Friends of Loris Karius, look away now.“If anyone has the charisma, principles and work ethic to keep the Liverpool side together in the face of adversity it’s Klopp,” says Alex Yeandle. “Through bad luck he has ended up trophy-less this evening, but he’s got the confidence to inspire the Liverpool team into great things. This is only the beginning.”Sometimes endings are disguised as beginnings. The start of next season is so important for Liverpool.In case your’ve been watching repeats of Dawson’s Creek all night, here’s the short story of the match:Here’s Jurgen Klopp “How couldn’t I feel for the players? There isn’t a lot to say: we started well and played exactly as we wanted to play. The situation with Ramos and Mo – that looks really bad, and it was a shock for the team. We lost our positive momentum. Half-time, came in, and then what can I say about the goals. We scored one, they scored three, that’s the result.“Mo’s World Cup place is in doubt. He would have played on if he could. I think he’s in hospital at the moment having an X-ray. It doesn’t look good.“What can I say? Loris knows it, everybody knows it. It’s a shame in a game like this and after a season like this. I really feel for him he’s a fantastic boy. I think the second mistake is because of the first one. It’s really difficult to get rid of the bad thoughts in your mind. Jurgen Klopp is due to Whatsapp me any minute now. As soon as he does, I’ll let you know his thoughts.There’s no more news on Mo Salah. The early diagnosis was a dislocated shoulder, which would make him almost certain to miss the World Cup. For such a joyous thing, sport can be savagely cruel sometimes.Luka Modric speaks! “To win it twice was amazing this is historic. We watched a movie yesterday about basketball teams who won competitions three or four times in a row, and they called it a dynasty. Now we can call this a dynasty. I don’t think anyone will repeat this achievement.”Rio Ferdinand, on BT Sport, thinks Bale’s goal is the best he‘s ever seen live. Zinedine Zidane’s reaction was marvellous, and reminiscent of Rinus Michels staggering around in disbelief when Marco van Basten scored that volley against USSR in the Euro 88 final. “If anybody has earned a raise at Real Madrid,” writes Asgeir Ingolfsson, “it‘s whoever is making those goalkeeper voodoo-dolls of their opponents: Buffon, Ulreich and now Karius.”“At what point,” writes Alex Netherton, “do we have to admit that Zidane is a palpably better manager than Pep Guardiola?”Jordan Henderson speaks. The poor bloke is miles away “It’s disappointing of course. We did well to get the goal and get back in the game, but we made mistakes and Madrid were really good. They were the better team. I felt we dominated in the first 30 minutes. It’s frustrating.“When Mo got injured they started to dominate the ball more. I’m not really sure what happened with the first goal or whether it should have been allowed. It’s not about Loris Karius and the mistakes he might have made it’s about the team. I’m so proud of the players and the fans. I hope we can keep going and get into more finals.”“Really, this is the kind of a performance which finishes careers,” says Shom Biswas. “Goalkeeping yips. I sincerely hope Karius can come back to any level of football after this.”I don’t think it’ll be that bad but I doubt he’ll play for Liverpool again.“Vamos!” shouts Ramos as he kisses his medal. Real are ready for the annual ritual of lifting the Champions League trophy, and Sergio Ramos drags it above his head to enormous cheers. They’ve done it again, again.Here’s Danny Taylor’s live match report from an emotional, slightly bizarre night in KievNow it’s Real’s turn. Zinedine Zidane has been playing a game for the last few months: Champions League or P45. He’s usually pretty inscrutable but he’s currently smiling like that old couple in Mulholland Drive. He has been a manager three seasons, and he has won the Champions League three times. What the hell kind of record is that?The Real players give Liverpool a guard of honour as they walk up to receive their medals. The defeat is something they can get over the manner of it will gnaw at them for a long time.Loris Karius walks up to the Liverpool fans, crying his eyes out as he lifts his hands in apology. The Liverpool fans applaud him empathetically.Here’s our snap match report from KievGareth Bale speaks “Obviously very disappointed not to start the game, so the best I couild do was come on and make an impact – and that’s what I did. It has to be the best goal I’ve ever scored. Just happy to get the win. We know what we’ve achieved and how good we’ve been. We let everyone else speak, we know how hungry and determined we are and we showed it again today. Jurgen Klopp is walking around consoling his players, looking a bit dazed after losing a sixth consecutive final. There is so much for him to take in, not least thoughts of the parallel universe in which Mo Salah did not go off injured. Liverpool were excellent until then.Karius is covering his face with his shirt. “That’s for life now, for him,” says Frank Lampard on BT Sport. “On a human level you have to feel for him.”Real Madrid become the first team since Bayern Munich in the mid-1970s to win three consecutive European Cups. Karius is broken, face down on the pitch. Dejan Lovren has dissolved in tears and is being consoled by one of the Real players, Kovacic I think. Bale goes over to console Karius, whose Liverpool career is probably over. We thought Gareth Bale’s Madrid career was over, but bloody hell he gave it a kiss of life tonight.Full time: Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool That’s it! Real retain their trophy with an ultimately comfortable victory in a bizarre final that will be remembered for many things: Mo Salah’s heartbreaking injury, Gareth Bale’s outrageous overhead kick, and most of all two unthinkable howlers from Loris Karius.90+3 min Ronaldo breaks through on goal, at which point a fan charges onto the field and is wrestled to the ground in the penalty area by two stewards. That was was astonishing.90 min For much of the season, Real Madrid have been a bit of a shambles. They’re about to win the Champions League for the third consecutive season. And actually, they have been much the better team overall tonight. Liverpool were superb until Salah’s injury shattered their morale.89 min “Where’s Barry Davies to say ‘Oh. Loris Karius’?” asks Adam Roberts. 88 min Real make another change, with Marco Asensio replacing Karim Benzema.86 min We usually get lost in the moment, which leads to hyperbole, but this really does feel like one of the most infamous goalkeeping performances of all time. Jurgen Klopp’s faith in Loris Karius has cost him in ways neither of them could ever have imagined. 85 min Bale, on a hat-trick as a substitute, surges thrillingly clear from the halfway line and is denied by a wonderful last-man tackle from Lovren.Bale cut inside from the right and hit a dipping shot from 30 yards that was straight down the throat of Karius, who spilled it over his shoulder into the net. It’s an awful mistake. Dear me, this has become the Lorus Karius final.Loris Karius has made another hideous mistake and Real Madrid are European champions!82 min Mane is booked for a foul on popular entertainer Sergio Ramos. That was harsh Ramos knew what he was doing.82 min Bale waves a majestic pass to Benzema, whose furious volley from 18 yards is beaten away by the flying Karius. It was a good rather than great save. Liverpool can’t get the ball.81 min “These nuclear takes on Bale’s being best final goal ever have clearly forgotten McManaman’s beautiful shinner vs Valencia and Paul Rideout’s header in 1995,” sniffs Lee Calvert of hit podcast Nessun Dorma.80 min The good news for Liverpool is that they still look dangerous when they have the ball. The bad news is that they are seeing less and less of the ball. Real’s experience is winning at the moment.78 min “I’m struggling to think of a better Champions League Final goal than Bale’s,” says Matt Richman. “Zidane’s booklet was from further out, but he had time to watch it drop. Bale had it fizzed at him. I know I’ve seen the worst.”I think Zidane’s was better - partly because of how far the ball had to drop and also because it felt like genius to order in a way that Bale’s didn’t quite. That said, I wouldn’t have a tantrum and unfriend you for preferring Bale’s.77 min Liverpool have respondly excellently both times to going behind. If it stays 2-1 they will get another chance.75 min What do Liverpool do from the bench? Their only realistic options are Solanke and Emre Can. I never thought I’d type this in a European Cup final MBM, but I wonder if Jurgen Klopp will regret not having Danny Ings among the subs.73 min Firmino appeals for a penalty when his cross hits the elbow of Varane. I don’t think it was. Real break and Robertson makes a glorious last-ditch challenge to deny Ronaldo, who was put through by Casemiro. 71 min Thanks for all the emails, even though I haven’t had chance to read most of them. I swear MBMs weren’t always this manic.70 min Sadio Mane has been Liverpool’s best attacker by a mile and he almost made it 2-2 there. He danced across the face of the box and hit a low left-footed drive from 20 yards that skimmed across the turf and clattered off the outside of the post. 69 min Great defending from Ramos! Robertson’s long angled pass from inside his own half bounces dangerously behind Ramos, allowing Mane to burst through on goal. Ramos recovers magnificently to stretch and boot the ball away.67 min Madrid are all over Liverpool now, and Klopp has few options on the bench. Lallana is nowhere near match fit I’d be tempted to take him off and bring on Solanke.65 min That might even have been Bale’s first touch of the game. It’s certainly the defining touch of his career. It was an outrageous goal.Marcelo, on the left wing, came back onto his right foot and lofted a generic cross into the box. It came at chest height to Bale, who was facing away from goal just inside the area. He launched into a crazily athletic, spidery overhead kick that flew over Karius and into the net. What the hell was that! Even Zidane, who scored the greatest ever Champions League final goal in 2002, reacted with disbelief.Oh my goodness, this is a stunning overhead kick!63 min “This is weird (but that’s football),” says Hubert O’Hearn. “However, that absolute Comedy Goal was exactly the slap in the face Liverpool needed.”It really was. If they win, it will be down to Lorus Karius’s incompetence. Football, eh.62 min Real have switched to 4-3-3, which means the BBC attack are back together. Liverpool’s sexy MFS, alas, were split up after half an hour.61 min Gareth Bale is getting ready to come on. Real are having loads of the ball now. Nacho’s sharp clow cross finds Isco, whose shot on the turn is pushed behind by the ing Karius. It was going wide anyway but Karius probably didn’t know that. That’s Isco’s last touch: Bale replaces him.57 min This is more like it. The gloves are off conceding that goal seemed to wake Liverpool from their slumber. As Glenn Hoddle says, “both teams are playing with emotion”. That suits Liverpool I think.That Varane header led to the corner which led to the goal. It was lofted very slowly towards the far post, where Lovren beasted Ramos to head the ball down into the six-yard box. Mane reacted quicker than anyone to poke it past Navas from close range.

I never want to interview anyone under the age of 80 again. Specifically, I never want to interview anyone who isn’t 80, and who doesn’t phone me for a catch-up call from a limo in Cannes, in which they are being driven to the airport, having gone to a deeply glamorous film festival party the night before and now finding themselves, as Fonda puts it delicately, “slightly hungover”. Fonda isn’t even hugely interested in Cannes these days, not like back in the day “when people wore their own clothes and went there to talk about movies”.No, she’s hungover in the limo, but wants to talk about the Black Lives Matter movement about what she has recently learned of the mass incarceration of African-Americans in her country and how it isn’t enough for white women like her to be empathetic. They have to stand up and make this stop, because America is a country built on slavery and it isn’t over yet.It’s a continuation of the conversation that began a few days previously, when I met her backstage at the Ellen DeGeneres chat show in Los Angeles. Fonda was preparing to promote her new film, Book Club, in which she plays one of four women who have reached a certain age, read Fifty Shades of Grey in their book club, and decided to do something about their passions. The link between spicing up your sex life and committing to ending gross inequality might not be an obvious one, but she explains that Book Club is about female solidarity and women having each other’s backs, and so is much of her “feminist activism”. Even though, when she first got interested in politics, she had just starred in the 1968 erotic sci-fi film Barbarella “and I took a lot of heat on it from feminists. The new women’s movement was in its early stages and there was a lot of…” she adopts a comically stern voice: “‘How do you feel making a movie that exploits women, like Barbarella?’ You’d kind of want to say: ‘Well, honey, nobody forced me.’ But,” she concedes, “it wasn’t much fun to make it.”Fonda’s small, white, fluffy dog Tulear is perched beside her. She actually wanted to name the dog Barbarella, but her daughter Vanessa, whose father, Roger Vadim, directed the film, wasn’t keen.If Book Club is a sort of geriatric Sex and the City, then Fonda plays the Samantha character, a leopardskin-clad businesswoman who schedules sex and won’t commit. “Vivian is sassy, she doesn’t want any emotional entanglements, and that was kind of fun.” Fonda explains that back in the early 20th century, “before there were the Nielsen ratings or whatever, the censor, there were actresses such as Myrna Loy, Barbara Stanwyck and Mae West playing dangerous women – the parts they played were like guys. Then puritanism crept in. But I think there are going to be more women-centric movies, like Book Club, now. A lot of these movies are doing well, and I don’t think this is a phase – I think this is it.”Jane Fonda was born in 1937, the daughter of the actor Henry Fonda, and while her life was socially privileged, her home life was agony, and her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, killed herself in a psychiatric hospital. (Fonda was 12 and only found out that her mother’s death was suicide from a movie magazine – nobody ever spoke to her about it.) Jane herself was also sexually abused and in her memoirs she writes movingly about the concept of disembodiment – how it took her until the age of 62 to fully inhabit her own body.Her marriage to Ted Turner had just ended, “and I was single again and I realised… I’m not scared,” she says of it now. “I was alone in the house, looking out through my own eyes and I could live inside my own skin. It was a revelation. It was something else.”How painful is it that it took so long to get herself back?“I feel very sad that so many girls are abused all over the world and that men don’t understand what it does to them. It’s not something that happens lightly, it can alter a person. And then you have to be very intentional about getting back into your own skin, but it can be done. It wasn’t so much that I felt sad about all the wasted time, because I wasn’t fully authentic, but on the other hand, why not instead just be proud of yourself that you got there and you didn’t stop trying?”She also links plastic surgery to sexual abuse and has said that when she sees the face “of a woman who has made herself into a mask, I always think to myself… I wonder, I wonder.” She had her own breast implants taken out and has also had several facelifts of which she says she is not proud.As for #MeToo, is it also painful to not have had such a movement 50 years ago? Fonda once again takes my negative and turns it into a positive.“I am very grateful to be alive through this,” she says softly. “I did not think I would live to see it. Yes. And I think that it’s going to continue, it’s not just a moment. I love the Time’s Up aspect of it. We’re working with women from all different places. I’m going to DC to lobby with domestic workers. The farm workers up in Bakersfield. It’s all of us together, having each other’s backs.”This is why she made the film 9 to 5 in 1980, which became one of Hollywood’s highest grossing comedies ever, despite its subject matter of the awful way men treated women in the workplace. Fonda wants to produce a new version of the film, with younger actors, who now find their work life even more precarious on zero-hours contracts. We discuss the state of the labour unions in the United States. “So all this is not so new for me. But it is for a lot of other actors, and that’s why it’s a very valuable thing to hear what other women in other industries have to put up with, women who are much more vulnerable than we are.”I have to say it: Jane Fonda looks stunning, immaculately coiffed and made up, and with the poise and elegance that has always been hers. It’s thanks to a lifetime of fitness regimes for which everyone remembers her videos, and also to the facelifts. But they, she says, were more about survival in her industry than about vanity. “They bought me an extra 10 years.” Like it or not, it does seem to be true. How many other 80-year-old women currently have a hit comedy series on Netflix (Grace and Frankie), as well as movies coming out, a documentary on their life about to hit HBO, and no signs of stopping any time soon?Of course this is all down to much more than surgery: it is the third act of a career that began more than half a century ago and has involved two Oscars for Best Actress (and a further five nominations) along the way. Curiously, it is the fitness videos that people in the UK remember her for the most. In the States, there are still people who boycott Jane Fonda’s films because of how deeply involved she got in protesting against the Vietnam war. Not that any of that stopped her.In Grace and Frankie, which is now approaching its fifth season, she and Lily Tomlin’s character become accidental, grumpy housemates after their husbands fall in love with each other. When I tell people I’m going to interview Jane Fonda, a surprisingly wide range of people tell me how much they love that show. “I know,” she says, her voice dropping to an absolute whisper. “We’re stunned. We did not expect that. We’re trying to figure it out!” she hisses.She loves working with her old friend Tomlin “because she’s a working-class gal who grew up in a fascinating family. People visit the set who were with her in elementary school. She is just so funny – and I’ve tried to learn that from her. But it just comes naturally to her.” Surely you’re funny, too, I say. “Oh no,” replies Fonda, “I don’t have a natural funny bone. I come from a long line of depressed people.” She laughs.Having been married several times and lived with various partners, and recently split up with her last boyfriend, the music producer Richard Perry (she describes him as “a younger man” – she also wrote a blog about him having Parkinson’s), Fonda now lives in a gated retirement enclave with her own house, but a shared community centre with a pool and tennis courts “where I always see one or two other residents who seem infinitely older than I am, but they probably aren’t. I never thought I would ever live there, but it’s great.”She does yoga and Pilates and has even made a whole new series of workout videos, “and their label is Prime Time, as they’re for older people. I can’t do the original workouts any more, because I’ll hurt myself,” she gestures to her hips, “as I have joint replacements.” In fact, she says her main form of exercise these days involves jumping into things “before I really know what I’m doing. It’s called a leap of faith and it’s my main form of exercise. It’s what keeps me young, too. That’s my new workout. When you take a leap of faith you don’t always land in the right place, but you sure do learn things. It’s good for the heart.”At the weekends, she leaves Los Angeles to go knocking on the door of Trump voters. “When you’re talking to them you can’t criticise Trump. You can’t criticise Fox News. All you can do is listen to what they care about and what they’re afraid of, and then maybe tell them something that they don’t know. Because we’re all in our bubbles, including me.” Do people recognise her? “I was in Bakersfield last Saturday and knocked on 30 doors. Only one person saw me coming and said: ‘Grace and Frankie!’ It was a kick! Nobody else knew who I was. I just say: ‘I’m Jane.’ They don’t need to know.”She has also been acting with Robert Redford again. I tell her that I recently watched Barefoot in the Park, the 1967 film where she and Redford are giddy newlyweds in New York, and then went to Netflix and watched Our Souls at Night, in which she and Redford reunited in 2017 to play widowed grandparents who get together to end their loneliness.I tell her it was a really beautiful night of cinema, to see these two actors come back together with their war wounds, their egos bruised, their hearts more honest in later life. To my surprise, Fonda’s eyes start to water. “Ohh,” she says softly. “It moves me that you say that.”She has said that she was always in love with him when they worked together, but they were always married to other people. He said recently that he had no idea she loved him. Do they keep in touch? Send texts? “Oh no. He doesn’t text, number one two, he’s a loner. So that’s that.” She says she won’t ever fall in love again. “I love men, I’m not done with men, but I’m done with marriage and dating.”Fonda is unimpressed by the romance in many modern films. “I’m not a big mouth opener on camera. Every time I see a love scene with young ones – they come at each other like this…” she mimes a big wide-open slobbering jaw, “…and I’m thinking, well where does the fun come in? Because the fun is the sensuality of lips. And then slowly moving beyond that. But not trying to swallow each other.” She giggles. “I would not want to go right into a tongue kiss, quite frankly.”And then Woody Harrelson walks past the dressing room. Fonda sends somebody to get him back. “I want to hug you!” she says, standing up to greet him. “I saw Three Billboards again last night because I had a house guest who hadn’t seen it. You’re so good Woody, God!” she says. “You’re so good, Jane!” says a glowing, goofy Harrelson. It’s like watching a peacock hug a panda.And then they both have to go off and be on the telly, and I am left with the sense of having just been visited by grace and greatness.Book Club is in cinemas from 1 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb986e5bfaca0a78bc839d761981b22f633fbe80/0_69_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411bfcbfab0041613146fd6b0b26261a","title":"martin parr day at the chelsea flower show a photo essay","story":"Magnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyMagnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyJust one woman at Chelsea, peering through a thicket of foxgloves with a wry smile on her face, has clocked the quiet man in the brown shirt, owner of the most famously satirical eye in British photography. Martin Parr, she has realised, has invaded one of the most prestigious flower shows in the world.“It does happen that somebody recognises me, but not often – and certainly not at Chelsea,” Parr says. “It happens if I go to London openings, but these people on the whole don’t go to exhibitions, they just like plants, they only go to gardens.“I’m always interested in people and Chelsea is heaving with a certain type: rock-solid middle England, middle-aged, middle-class, grey hair, grey pound – still a very important part of the constituency. It’s as white as it gets: I think the only ethnic minority people I met were stewarding or working in the shops.”Anyone who does recognise Parr might worry they are about to be gently mocked in searing colour, like his scorched ice-cream eaters on pebbly beaches, or his silent couples perched glumly at cafe tables.He can barely tell a dandelion from an orchid, but he loves Chelsea, where every hat bears more flowers than any show garden, every recklessly patterned shirt is stretched over a post-prandial stomach.“Oh, I do love Chelsea,” he says. “I love anywhere where there are people. That’s my only dread, that there won’t be enough people, and you don’t have to worry about that at Chelsea. The only problem is that there are just so many of them, you have to fight your way through the crowds.”Parr has been accused in the past of artificially tweaking the colours in his images: “Another urban myth about me, not true.” But that’s not a problem at Chelsea – it bursts with colour.Having captured a man in crimson trousers intently studying some Wedgwood china that matches his floral shirt, Parr positions himself by a violently pink rose.“I thought it would be fun to do a sequence of people smelling the same rose, and I knew this was the one. It had the maximum smell in appearance and the minimum in results – that accounts for the expression of disappointment on so many of the faces.”Many people have given up even pretending to enjoy themselves. He snaps one bench entirely occupied by weary figures who have been left minding the shopping.Few men feature in his Chelsea images. Parr spends the next day at the cricket, realising where all the men have gone. “These are two perfectly matched events – exactly the same types, but the men are at Lords and the women are at Chelsea. Two sides of the same coin.”He is going back to Chelsea for the last day, when the temporary gardens are dismantled and sold. “Mobs of people staggering out trying to carry plants bigger than themselves – that’s what I’m hoping to see. Lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da138a6edf63a6fa1b148fb0be1071e8b2d6c1ba/0_36_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfae75880a5794f136260fa984bfb10e","title":"gay hussar soho to shut soho labour lunches plots gossip","story":"The Gay Hussar is among the most celebrated restaurants in London but its fame rests not so much on the quality of its chilled wild-cherry soup and its goulash, but on its reputation as the beating heart of political gossip.The Hungarian restaurant in the centre of Soho has played host to generations of politicians, many drawn from the left, including Aneurin Bevan, Michael Foot, Tom Driberg, Ian Mikardo and Barbara Castle. It is also rumoured to be where the Tory wets fruitlessly plotted the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s.But after 65 years as a hotbed of political plotting, backstabbing, deal-making and gossip, it is due to close its doors for the last time in June.A combination of spiralling overheads, including business rates and rent, and a slump in lunchtime bookings – with politicians no longer prepared to trek over from Westminster for inevitably lengthy alcohol-fuelled lunches – has sounded the death knell for the eccentric establishment. Its owner, Corus Hotels, is closing the restaurant and selling the lease. Distraught staff have been told to expect to serve up the final meals on\u0026nbsp21 June.The three-storey restaurant in Greek Street staved off a threat of closure in 2013 when Corus – the UK arm of a Malaysian conglomerate that also owns Laura Ashley – put it on the market. That led to 160 politicians and journalists banding together as the so-called Goulash Co-operative, requiring a minimum investment of £500, and offering to chip in to buy it.In the end, with no decent offer on the table, Corus agreed to keep the restaurant open, giving it a minor rebrand as GH Soho, although with the restaurant’s traditional interiors and old-school meaty menu left largely unchanged.The Goulash Co-operative is again attempting a rescue – galvanising its membership with a new fundraising drive to add to the £150,000 already raised, and launching a plan not only to save the restaurant but to create an improved venue that better reflects changing tastes and trends.“We believe now is the time to create a new Gay Hussar, and are in talks with possible partners who agree with us that this unique establishment must be saved,” said the Goulash Co-operative’s spokesman John Goodman. “It’s showing its age. We have lots of exciting plans to renovate it, including installing a dumb waiter and a downstairs toilet.”Since it opened in 1953 it has been a haunt and popular watering hole of politicians, writers and artists. Devoted regulars have included the Labour grandees Roy Hattersley and Michael Foot – who celebrated his 90th birthday there – and more recently Gordon Brown. Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams had a regular table on the first floor, where he would bellow out whispered titbits from his informants. Election victories have been celebrated there and sorrows and defeats drowned with copious amounts of bull’s blood.It was founded by Victor Sassie, son of a Swiss father and Welsh mother, who trained for the restaurant trade partly in Hungary and opened his own establishment, the Budapest, in London in 1939. During the second world war, he worked for British military intelligence, and for Robert Maxwell after it. Sassie, who died in 1999, sold the Gay Hussar to the Restaurant Partnership in 1988.Over more than six decades the traditional decor of the open-plan ground-floor restaurant and two crimson-hued private rooms – connected by a narrow staircase – has barely changed, with every space and surface stuffed with books, caricatures and pictures.Downstairs, the wall-to-wall framed Martin Rowson cartoons of the political elite’s great and not-so-good – officially “on loan” from the artist – have been expanded to include the new generation of MPs, even if many choose not to dine there. The ground-floor dining room accommodates up to 40 diners, while two private rooms upstairs (with 25 and 12 covers) give scope for more discreet exchanges behind closed doors, over the dark wood tables and behind thick velvet drapes.Mark Seddon, the journalist and former Tribune editor and a member of the Goulash Co-operative, said: “There’s a lot of love for the place and we have plenty of ideas for reviving it. We think it has potential for literary events. It’s all very exciting.”Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, said: “The action of Corus Hotels is deplorable and must be resisted. Supporters of the Gay Hussar have already raised a large sum with big and small donations. Now we must do that again to give us a fighting chance of securing the future of a restaurant which is part of political history.”Wrobel is not planning a farewell party on 21 June. “We will go quietly with a dignified ending,” he said. “There is nothing to celebrate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5622e8a42c95ba4a61154277895975527cb602bc/0_400_5300_3180/master/5300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a615f878f8f0cb273ecf5e8f2b3ac7b","title":"superyachts something goes wrong raise the anchor","story":"Crewing can seem a glamour-filled job. But at least three young Brits have lost their lives, as Rupert Neate reportsIf Dirk Zimmerman’s boss fancies a fresh tomato salad, the 35-year-old German hangs up his chef’s apron, dons a headset and takes to the skies. Zimmerman, who has been working on superyachts for more than a decade, has lost count of the number of times he’s been sent out on a ship’s helicopter or seaplane to source food, from courgettes in Oman to truffles in Argentina or vine tomatoes from a nearby Pacific atoll.“It might shock you to know how much money some people spend privately,” he says as he prepares sushi in the professional-grade kitchen on the 60-metre St David, moored in Monaco. “But to be able to take a helicopter and fly two hours somewhere to get the boss’s preferences makes his day.”As the rich become even richer – 145 more dollar billionaires were minted last year – orders for new superyachts (longer than 24 metres) have hit a record high. More than 500 are being built in shipyards around the world, and with many requiring at least 100 staff, superyachts now employ more than 37,000 people. Britain’s seafaring history has made it the biggest source of employees crewing on a superyacht is so popular among young adventurers that Southampton Solent University now offers degree-level training at its Warsash Superyacht Academy. Every spring, dozens of young Brits decamp to Antibes on the Côte d’Azur, the unofficial centre for superyacht crew recruitment, where you can wander along the docks looking for opportunities.While it is a dream job for some, other deckhands and chefs have horror stories of working punishing hours. Accidents, injuries and deaths are also commonplace, with union leaders believing working on superyachts to be more dangerous than life on oil rigs over the past few years at least three young Brits have died while serving their billionaire bosses. Because many superyachts continually float around the world (this is marketed to some as a way to avoid being registered in any country and hence to avoid paying tax), their crews may not be afforded the same legal protections as those on land. Families complain about a lack of assistance and sympathy from owners and those in charge of the vessel. None of the owners attended the three British men’s funerals.Michael Hanlon, 22, left Cumbria for his dream job as a deckhand and watersports instructor on 62-metre superyacht Faith, owned by the Canadian fashion billionaire Lawrence Stroll, in March 2013. Less than a month later, and before he’d had a chance to spend any of his first $3,500 (£2,600) monthly pay cheque, he was dead.Michael, known as Milo to his friends and family, had returned exhausted from a night out to the vessel docked in Antibes on the French Riviera. He had done two shifts back to back, working night and day, then gone to local bars to celebrate sailing across the Atlantic. Faith had been locked up for the night, and Michael climbed to its top in an attempt to get inside via an unofficial emergency entrance. An inquest found he fell from the top deck, hit his head on the quay and drowned. His body was recovered the next day.Jacob Nichol, from Cornwall, died last summer, aged 24, two years after he suffered severe brain injuries after falling from superyacht Kibo, while cleaning it as it was docked in a Majorcan port. Jacob, the yacht’s third assistant engineer, had been hanging in a harness when he fell and fractured his skull. His sister, Jenade Moon, said he had never been asked to clean the boat before: his job focused on engine maintenance. The owner of the £90m yacht, Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut – until last month owner of Waterstones, and friend of Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich – was not on board at the time.After 10 days in a coma in a hospital in Palma, Jacob was repatriated to Shropshire, where he needed constant care. In September an inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death. “Our beautiful Jacob has sadly passed away,” his family said. “A young, bright, intelligent, kind soul has left us after an excruciating two years.”In 2010, Robin Black received a call from the captain of the £15m sailing superyacht Burrasca, on which Black’s son Will was bosun, or officer in charge of crew and equipment. At the time, it was moored at the Monaco yacht show in Port Hercules, the annual beauty parade held in the industry’s global hub. The captain told Black that Will, 28, hadn’t been seen since the night before, when the rib he was piloting (a small boat used to ferry passengers to and from the yacht) collided with another boat. He thought Will may have been knocked overboard.By the time Robin, Will’s mother Judith and his sister Rosanna, now 37, arrived in Monaco to join the search, the yacht had left. “The captain said: ‘Don’t worry, we threw some flowers over the side and gave his belongings to the police,’” Rosanna says, fighting back tears as she describes “the worst days of our lives”. “I couldn’t comprehend that the boat had gone before Will was found and before we got there,” she says. “How could they just leave a family to deal with the death of one of their crew, and the police and paperwork and everything? I can’t believe that if something goes wrong – if someone dies – they can just raise the anchor and leave.”The family don’t know who owns Burrasca, though he is thought to have been a Russian billionaire (owners do not have to declare themselves). He was not on board at the time of the accident. The yacht did not request ers to look for Will’s body, leaving the captain of another superyacht, who was a friend, to pay for search and recovery ers. But they were unable to find Will, who had not been wearing a life vest.Will’s life was not insured. “But it’s not about money,” Rosanna says, “it’s about respect for another life.” She says that the owner didn’t and doesn’t seem to have cared. A spokesman for the yacht’s management did not respond to the ’s requests for comment.If something goes wrong on a superyacht, it can be incredibly difficult for crew and their families to understand which laws and rights apply. Vessels are often operating in international waters, their day-to-day operations run by management companies on behalf of often unidentifiable owners their yachts are registered via offshore companies in places such as Panama or the British Virgin Islands.To add to the confusion, superyachts can be registered with another country and fly their flag, even if the yacht is not based there. At the time of Will’s death, Burrasca was registered in St Vincent and the Grenadines. There was no British inquest, and local authorities recorded this report of the accident: “Mr William Black was on tender duty between the mothership at anchor and the shore. The anchorage was very crowded. Returning to the mothership, the tender hit an unattended vessel that was anchored in the bay. The tender was found drifting with no one on board… Mr Black’s body was not found.”Will, who had always wanted a life of adventure, had worked his way up from a deckhand on smaller boats to an officer on Burrasca. He’d recently begun his role as bosun on the 55.7-metre yacht and Rosanna says he was passionate about his job. “Will had found his calling. He worked hard, but he played hard, too, and always came back with the most amazing stories,” she says as she shows me photos of Will on a night out with 50 Cent and Jamiroquai. “We still get letters from some of the families he worked for. They send cards for Uncle Whale, as he was called,” she says. “He had a huge personality and everyone loved him.”Despite the circumstances of his death, Rosanna says she would not discourage others from joining the superyachting world. “I would just tell them to make sure they’re always on top of safety, and to find out who the owner is before they join.”It’s shorts, T-shirts and deck shoes weather at the Monaco yacht show, as I weave my way through champagne receptions, passing Ferraris and Aston Martins for sale on the quayside. This year’s display of yachts is collectively worth more than £2bn the combined annual spending on the world’s 6,281 superyachts could wipe out all developing countries’ debts.There are so many superyachts docked for the show that Top Shop boss Sir Philip Green’s £100m Lionheart has been forced out of its mooring into the Bay of Monaco. The 110-metre Jubilee, which was built for the late emir of Qatar, is on sale for $300m.On board the six-cabin St David, which is on sale for just under £20m, Zimmerman is preparing canapes for a party. He says the industry keeps many people in well-paid employment, adding that he can’t envisage going back to work on land, as “the pay cannot compare. I have three children, and working here pays for their education.” But, he adds, newbies have to decide early on whether they can sit by and watch their billionaire bosses spend vast amounts enjoying themselves, while appearing not to care about those around them. “It’s a compromise that everyone has to make – can you accept it?”Liz Brasler, 29, is chief mate, or second-in-command, of one of the yachts in the harbour. She won’t say which but “it’s one of the bigger ones”. She has worked her way up the ranks from deckhand since 2006. “It can be great fun but it’s also exhausting, delivering the highest standards invisibly, magically, with no apparent fuss,” she says. “Owners expect the best in the world. They want to go wherever, whenever, and demand the highest standards without delay. Money is not a problem for them.”For most of her career, Brasler, who is South African, bunked with colleagues in small cabins now she has a cabin of her own. But while she has more privacy, she says she can’t remember the last time she had seven hours’ sleep while on charter or at sea.The billionaires’ superyacht designer of choice, Andrew Winch, knows all about the needs of the super-rich. We speak on Cloud 9, the 74-metre, £59m yacht he designed for the Australian retail tycoon Brett Blundy this is the first time he has stepped aboard since he handed it over. Winch, who has designed yachts in a London studio since 1986, created Madame Gu, the 2014 motor yacht of the year, and Phoenix 2, owned by the late Polish billionaire Jan Kulczyk. His yacht designs have proved so popular that he now designs clients’ homes and planes, including Roman Abramovich’s Boeing 767.“Most clients will have three, four or five houses around the world,” he says. “We have clients we’ve already worked with on their jet and their yacht, and soon there will be a ‘rollover’ and we’ll start on another sequence.”Everything on board is designed for the owner, from the bedroom suites named after Star Wars characters (his favourite film), to the extra head space above the gym’s treadmill (he’s tall) and the proliferation of chess sets: “He likes to play chess, for several days, with various guests at the same time,” Winch says. In the hair salon, a wall folds down to create a balcony “because it’s very nice, when the sun’s setting in Greece, to have a massage outside”.A short ride downstairs in the ship’s glass-topped elevator is the “beach club” at the bow. From here Blundy and his guests can hit the water with the boat’s “toys”, including a speedboat for waterskiing, jetskis and what Winch calls a “James Bond-style personal submarine”. A “water sports and boys’ toys” instructor will be on hand to help guests get the hang of it and take care of “all the boring things”, like cleaning and clearing away. For guests who dislike the swell or salt of the ocean, there’s a swimming pool above an espresso bar.The ship’s teacher, one of 22 staff, is on hand to guide their learning. There’s also a nanny, personal trainer, masseuse and hairdresser. “You take your life with you,” Winch explains.“Life on board is perfect for owners – they receive a seven-star service. But for officers and crew it can be a lot more difficult,” says Danny McGowan, the strategic organiser of seafarers’ union, Nautilus International. He has come from their offices in London to the Monaco show to draw attention to the deaths of young workers, highlighting the dangers of working in an industry that to outsiders appears the height of glamour.“They will often be working very long hours, right around the clock, looking after guests,” says the fair-skinned, red-haired McGowan, sheltering from the sun in Monaco’s famous La Rascasse bar, which a crew recruitment company has hired out for the week. “These are tragic situations where young people have lost their lives, and there are hundreds of other injuries and complaints that aren’t reported.” He says staff have had their passports confiscated and wages withheld they talk of being sent home for the slightest uniform infraction.Superyacht owners can view crew as “dispensable and replaceable” and don’t consider the impact on their families. “Often an owner feels they can just get a new third engineer, rather than thinking of the consequences for the inidual,” he says. “We’re not here to be up against these billionaires. We want to work with them to make employment in this industry better.”Most recently, McGowan has been representing the 42-strong crew of a £67m superyacht owned by the Indian multimillionaire Vijay Mallya. The crew, among them several Britons, haven’t been paid for months, and are owed more than $1m. McGowan helped them take their case to court, to have the yacht impounded in Malta. Mallya, a co-owner of the Force India Formula One team, was arrested in London last year over allegations that he supported the team with laundered cash, and Indian authorities are currently seeking his extradition to face trial. He is living in a Hertfordshire mansion while on bail the yacht, which features a 15-seat cinema and Sir Elton John’s baby grand piano, remains impounded, with some of the crew still on board.Sitting on the harbour wall overlooking Cloud 9 and a fleet of other superyachts, Fiona Hanlon fights back tears as she remembers the “heartbreakingly impersonal” way she was informed of the death of her 22-year-old son, Michael.Hanlon has flown to Monaco from the family home in the Lake District to scatter Michael’s ashes. At the same time, knowing he had worked two shifts back to back, she is taking the opportunity to highlight the plight of some other superyacht crew, who she says are often forced to work long hours – conditions that might be illegal in the UK. “It was Michael’s dream job,” she says. He grew up sailing on Windermere. “He had just got his first salary and he’d sent me photographs of the sunglasses and travelling guitar he was going to buy. He was so excited, it was wonderful.”Michael had been texting his mother daily updates about his adventures sailing across the Atlantic. But on 7 April 2013, Fiona’s phone didn’t ping. She texted him: “Worried about you now – no contact gets me thinking something is wrong – say hello soon please x” followed by, “My baby where are you x x please get in touch angel – we just want to know you are OK.”The next day his mother was told Michael was missing. “It was seen as an inconvenience, as the boat was going on to pick up Catherine Zeta-Jones,” she says. The following day Michael’s body was found under the yacht by police ers.The coroner for Cumbria, Philip Sharp, ruled that he died from drowning and recorded a verdict of accidental death. He wrote to the yacht’s registered owner – a PO box in the British Virgin Islands – to raise concerns that “crew members and in this case the deceased were likely to have been asked to work additional shifts when the boat came in to port, potentially causing tiredness”. Sharp’s letter required the yacht’s owner to provide all crew with a key to the boat, and to ensure the captain check the crew are not required to work excessive hours.An unnamed director of the superyacht’s owner, Pluteus Limited (a company based in Monaco, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and registered in the Cayman Islands), wrote to the coroner to say: “We are keen to cooperate and address the concerns you have identified as a result of the inquest. However, please note that in doing so, no acknowledgment or admission of failings or liability is intended or to be inferred.”The director said that access to the yacht had been improved by the provision of keyless codes to all staff. It was also promised that working hours would be monitored, “to ensure crew members are not working additional hours without the requisite rest periods, in particular between shifts, unless the safety of the boat, crew and passengers is in danger”.Meanwhile, chief mate Liz Brasler is wondering what job she might do next. She says that while working on superyachts has been fun, it can be difficult, demoralising and sometimes dangerous. Friends have been injured and she knows of others who have died. “We’re insured, but it doesn’t cover everything. I know the price of my life,” she says. “And it’s less than my parents think.”• Commenting on this piece?

But I’m a chef, so I can’t help myself. When they’re super-fresh, I’ll still put peas raw in a salad, but otherwise I might blanch them very lightly, throw them, pods and all, on a hot grill or cook them for so long that they turn almost khaki-grey. There’s a real versatility to the humble little pea, and sometimes it pays not to eat them straight from the pod.This warm side salad is all about the beautiful leaves, vegetables and herbs. I’ve used a few different types of radicchio, but you could also use chicory or whatever mix of bitter leaves you can get your hands on. Not much more than garlic and lemon is needed to make this sing, but a few drops of chilli oil wouldn’t go amiss, too.Prep 12 minCook 12 minServes 4 as a side3 small garlic cloves, peeled and crushed3-4 lemons, zest finely grated, to get 1½ tbsp, and juiced, to get 60ml75ml olive oilFlaked sea salt and black pepper450g mixed radicchio leaves, ideally pink, taro and castelfranco, trimmed and roughly torn600g sugar snap peas, fibrous threads removed3 tbsp dill leaves, roughly chopped3 tbsp tarragon leaves, roughly choppedPut the first three ingredients in a small bowl with three teaspoons of salt and plenty of pepper.Put half the leaves and all the sugar snaps in a large bowl, pour over two-thirds of the garlic and lemon mixture, and toss to coat.Heat a large griddle pan on a high heat (as always, remember to ventilate the kitchen first). Once very hot, turn down the heat to medium, then griddle the dressed leaves and sugar snaps for about four minutes, turning every now and then, until everything has good char marks – spread them out in the pan, so they all get some heat, and cook in batches if need be.Transfer the griddled vegetables to a large bowl, add the raw leaves, herbs and the remaining dressing, toss gently and serve at once.This party snack is a bit of a commitment – get a helper, if you can – but it pays off when that green bechamel filling comes oozing out, all delicious and warm. That said, you can roll them a day ahead, refrigerate overnight and fry from room temperature the next day.Prep 30 minCook 30 min, plus 20-30 min to roll the cigarsMakes 2450g unsalted butter, plus 150g melted butter extra, for brushing 40g plain flour400ml whole milk1 tsp dijon mustardSalt and black pepper250g baby spinach20g basil leaves, roughly chopped10g mint leaves, roughly chopped½ tsp ground Iranian lime (optional)1½ tsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed300g fresh or defrosted frozen peas350g blanched fresh or defrosted frozen broad beans, skins removed200g feta, roughly crumbled into 2cm pieces300g filo pastry (ie, 12 39cm x 30cm sheets) 1 egg, beaten500ml sunflower oil3 lemons, cut into wedges, to servePut 50g butter and the flour in a medium saucepan on a medium heat, and stir constantly until the butter and flour have come together and are bubbling – about four minutes. Mix together the milk, mustard, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, then add to the flour pan in three instalments, whisking all the time, until you have a smooth sauce. Turn the heat to low, cook for 10 minutes, whisking frequently, then leave to cool.Put the spinach in a medium pan on a medium-high heat, add a splash of water and cook for two to three minutes, until wilted, then drain in a colander and leave to cool. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze out as much water as you can: you should end up with about 150g cooked spinach. Put this in a food processor with the bechamel sauce, herbs, Iranian lime (if using), fennel seeds and half the peas, and pulse a few times to break down the spinach and peas a little. Tip into a large bowl, gently stir in the remaining peas, broad beans, feta and two-thirds of a teaspoon of salt, then refrigerate.Take one sheet of filo and, with the longest edge facing towards you, cut it in half lengthways. Brush both pieces with a little melted butter. Spoon 50g (or two to three tablespoons) of filling on one of the shorter ends of one of the two pieces of filo, then use your hands to form the filling into a sausage shape, leaving 2cm of pastry clear at the bottom. Fold the bottom end of the pastry up over the filling, then roll up into a thick cigar, tucking in the sides as you go. Lightly brush the ends of the pastry with a little egg wash, then seal (the egg wash will prevent the filling from escaping when cooking). Do the same with the second piece of filo, then repeat with the remaining filo sheets until you have 24 cigars.Heat the oil in a medium pan on a medium-high flame: it’s hot enough when a small piece of excess pastry browns within five to 10 seconds. Carefully put four or five cigars into the hot oil and fry for two to three minutes in all, turning once halfway, until golden brown all over. With a slotted spoon, transfer the cigars to a plate lined with kitchen paper, sprinkle with salt, and keep warm while you repeat with the remaining cigars (lower the heat if they start to colour too quickly). Serve hot with the lemon wedges alongside.This is my version of vignole, a traditional Roman dish that celebrates green spring vegetables.

Squeeze the juice to give you a tablespoon.Heat the oil on a medium flame in a medium saute pan for which you have a lid and, once hot but not bubbling, add the garlic and spring onions. Turn down the heat to medium-low and cook gently until the garlic just starts to take on a little colour – about five minutes.Add the mangetout, sugar snaps, asparagus, lemon strips, orzo, 400ml water, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a generous grind of black pepper.

Some will come directly, arriving on your phone at 4am in the masked form of links to feminist websites. Some will appear in your lap at the hairdressers, or hidden in an interview with a director whose film you keep meaning to see, or ripped carefully against a ruler and included in a birthday card from your mum. Some you will search out yourself, as if you are a woman creeping through a lonely house with a knife having heard glass break downstairs – better you catch this intruder, than it catches you.Depending on the decade in which you come of age, these stories will be focused on the importance of having children young, or old, or of freezing your eggs so you can think about it later, or of how to find the perfect mate, or of the liberating glee that comes with doing it alone. There will be an equal number, too, explaining the benefits of remaining childless, your fellow women in snazzy heels and shiny skin leaning in to tell you about the fulfilling life it is possible to lead without the weight of a kid round your neck and, indeed, the compelling political reasons why you should never procreate.But despite being different stories, they all have the same ending. They all suggest that having a child or not having a child is simply a matter of a woman’s decision. They force you to think about babies, even if your hormones aren’t interested. These stories poke at your intellect, your curiosity about life and its side-effects. And they all make you feel extremely weary. And anxious. And lonely, sometimes, and also, on bad nights, already 75 and regretful about the other life you could have led.Having waded through that swamp of commentary, and having emerged virtually unscathed, with (though I don’t like to boast) the best three-year-old in Britain, I was unprepared for the second chapter. While the pressure to have children is so well-documented, there are no warnings about the pressure to have a second. It sneaks in, like ants come summer. There are few glossy magazine articles about this – in fact, so ingrained is the importance of siblings in the swarming consciousness of our culture that, unlike the seemingly genuine questions about whether to procreate in the first place, the adjacent debate about having more than one focuses purely on whether the existing child will be ruined by their onlyness. The parents are no longer part of the conversation. And it’s a conversation that is much stickier, seeing as it is now seen to be less about what the family wants but about what the child needs.A mother’s decision not to do it again, for reasons ranging from the practical (they’d have to move house, they can’t afford maternity leave) to the emotional (she had postnatal depression, she found the weight of love painful, like a two-year hangover), is irrelevant when faced with the idea that it will screw up her kid. If you have a child, then you must have another. To choose to stop there, it seems, from the combination of frozen smiles and earthy anecdotes about the psychopathic only child they knew growing up, or the future sadness of this two-year-old having to organise your funeral without a sister, is to be not just selfish, but perverse. Mothers are ided, again, into good and bad.I remember quite confidently predicting that one of the great benefits of growing up later than our parents would be the inevitable camaraderie of my friends either having one child or none at all, yet living close enough to each other that it would feel like we were a big sprawling family, but without the daily fights about hairdryers. It didn’t happen. Instead, we either mirrored the journeys of our parents, slotting new families into the holes left behind, or blazed off into radical new futures far far away. The middle way, with one child and no marriage, seemed so much more sensible to 20-odd-year-old me – so much more portable, and affordable. So neat. And then I had a baby.Does it screw a kid up, to be an only child? The evidence is sparse and weighted oddly. For every thin study saying yes, there’s a companion one saying no. And if it does, then what? The answer can’t simply be to have more children. Even if the idea of choice was real and solid – rather than a melting Solero in our hand – to me the whole exercise stinks slightly. We bring ourselves up to believe that we are perfectible. That simply by eradicating sugar from our diet, or by altering the questions we ask of our partners, or upon cutting in a choppy bob, all fear and anxiety will float away. Similarly, we’re encouraged to follow marked paths in order to create this version of symmetrical perfection, in the sunken belief that there is one correct way for a family to look. I’m not worried that being an only child will screw our daughter up. I have every confidence we’ll manage that anyway, whatever shape our family takes.In a speech last week, Sophie Walker (the leader of the Women’s Equality party) pointed out a problem with many businesses half-hearted movements towards equal representation. ‘Women don’t need mentors to get ahead.

In a preliminary ruling this week, Ofcom says it has “reasonable grounds to believe” that Virgin has contravened its general conditions which state companies cannot charge excessive fees that disincentivise customers from switching supplier.The company may also have fallen foul of Ofcom rules by failing to publish clear information on fees,\u0026nbspand by requiring customers who move home to sign a new fixed-term contract or face an early termination charge.“Having assessed all available evidence, we have reasonable grounds to believe Virgin Media has broken our rules,” says Ofcom. “Virgin Media now has an opportunity to formally respond to our provisional decision. We will take any further representations the company makes into account before our final ruling.”Ofcom launched its investigation in response to a high number of complaints about the cable giant.But the most contentious issue – early termination charges levied on those who move home but to an area not served by Virgin’s cable network so cannot get the service even if they wish to continue – is not yet covered by Ofcom’s rules.Earlier this year,  reported how 80-year-old Ann Squires was forced to pay £136.88 when she had to leave her home of 40 years and move to a flat three miles away.When she notified Virgin of her new address she was told that it could no longer provide a service and yet still demanded an early termination charge for cancelling her contract. It issued a default notice under the Consumer Credit Act when she challenged the fee.Numerous other customers have also been forced to pay up even though Virgin told them it could no longer provide a service.Surprisingly, Ofcom says: “The terms that require Virgin customers moving home outside of its network to pay early termination charges do not fall within Ofcom’s rules.“We are continuing to consider whether they raise concerns under general consumer law. We will provide an update on this aspect of its investigation in due course.”Virgin Media says: “We have received Ofcom’s provisional findings and we will now review them thoroughly. We make it clear to customers that early disconnection fees can apply and we also offer 30-day rolling contracts for those that do not want to sign up for a minimum period, such as 12 months, and need more flexibility.”This month Ofcom announced an investigation into the early termination fees charged by EE."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeeb92cbe0c9c1242c0aa9eeee63fcad83608f60/58_345_3345_2007/master/3345.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373ec3d0384938e5c2f82d4fbb9cf159","title":"busking joins cashless society as musicians start using card readers","story":"London to introduce world’s first contactless payment scheme for street performersLondon is to introduce a contactless payment scheme for buskers in what organisers say is a world first.Busk in London, a Mayor of London initiative, has partnered with technology company iZettle to give card readers to performers.

The phenomenal rise of electronic dance music (EDM) may have entered a new, more mature phase, according to DJs and industry experts.An annual state-of-the industry report presented at the International Music Summit (IMS) in Ibiza last week, which examined everything from recorded music sales to DJ earnings, club and festival revenues and merchandising, suggests the industry is in rude health in Asia but is losing market share in the US and Europe.Kevin Watson, founder of Danceonomics, a knowledge hub for the electronic music industry, and the author of the report, said that, given such success, it was not surprising that appetite for the genre would eventually stall. “I think there’s still plenty of room for growth going forward. There’s been a slight dip but that’s to be expected, and the numbers still remain very positive on what the future looks like.”The rise of EDM has been powered by technology, with social media helping build the profiles of emerging artists such as the Belgian techno DJ Amelie Lens. It has also transformed the music distribution model.“Kids in their bedrooms can – pretty much for free – produce their own electronic music track and distribute it instantly,” Watson said. “And there’s lots of people out there that are now doing this and becoming very successful, because there are now almost zero investment costs.”Watson’s report will be seen in some quarters as confirmation that the long-predicted bursting of the EDM bubble has finally happened.But those within the industry suggest the picture is more nuanced. Pete Tong, the DJ and co-founder of the International Music Summit, told Music Week that the bubble had “punctured” rather than burst.“I guess another analogy would be: ‘The party’s over, it’s now time to really get your hands dirty, get back to work and look after this business you’ve built for this level and get it to the next phase’,” Tong said.Watson agreed, noting that as electronic music (he eschews the EDM label, arguing it has become synonymous with the commercial side of the genre) has teamed up with mainstream artists and festivals, its impact has become disguised. “You see a lot of tracks that are produced with DJs collaborating with other artists and a lot of those are being classified as pop or R\u0026ampB,” he said. “They’re not getting registered in electronic music’s share of sales. Another thing we’re seeing is a lot of mainstream festivals like Coachella, which we wouldn’t normally term electronic music festivals, are booking a lot of electronic music DJs and artists.”Recent examples of mainstream acts teaming up with EDM artists include Coldplay and the Chainsmokers, Justin Bieber’s work with Skrillex and Diplo and Ariana Grande’s collaboration with the DJ and producer Zedd.Conversely, as other music genres assimilate it, parts of the electronic music movement have gone more underground.“Quite often when things become much more populist and commercial, a lot of people become more focused on the underground, and that experiences a renaissance as well,” Watson said. “People might read about Coldplay and the Chainsmokers and the latest smash hit, but actually there’s a lot of stuff going on across the industry and there’s plenty of room for everyone to champion their particular sound.”Tom Faber, a DJ and music critic, predicts that the genre, whose roots lie in 1970s artists such as Kraftwerk and King Tubby, will continue to mutate. “Electronic music has been a thing over the last 40 years: it’s always going in and out of the mainstream. It’s one of the genres that’s always coming back. For me, electronic music is always looking forward, always doing something new.”For EDM’s superstar DJs, the industry continues to be a cash cow.

She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the foundation. In a statement last week, the foundation said it totally rejected “the renewed accusations that Nazanin is guilty of spreading propaganda”.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told the BBC that she had met a judge “who said there would be a charge of spreading propaganda against the regime.

It’s madness.”Campbell, one of Blair’s most loyal lieutenants, said he still could not get over Corbyn being leader. “I’ve known him on and off for 40 years and I find it incredible, the whole thing incredible.“I hate what he has done to the Labour party and his position on Brexit, I’m afraid, absolutely does my head in because the Labour party is meant to be the party for working people and working people are going to get absolutely shafted by Brexit.”Campbell said Corbyn could win the next election but would not. Many people had voted Labour last time because they knew Corbyn would not win, he said, but next time would be different.“There is such a gap between this ‘oh Jeremy Corbyn world’ where he is transported from one adoring audience to the next and what actually is happening with the public.“Labour lost the election against the worst campaign there has ever been and since then they have behaved like they’ve won – it just does my head in.”Campbell said the last election was a tragedy because it involved two competing visions of the past – the 1950s for Theresa May and 1970s for Corbyn.In an entertaining session, he spoke about his dislike of big crowds, such as the ones for the royal wedding – “I hate those things where everyone is meant to feel something” – and which political memoirs would be remembered by future generations.His diaries would be studied, he said. He had read many of the memoirs from the time of the last Labour government and he admired some more than others. He liked Blair’s and Alan Johnson’s.Did he enjoy Peter Mandelson’s book? “Erm ...

I think he was trying too hard to make a point,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2f56c5575a9ff91b5116e446ae0f9b8397f1c2c/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d4e1c6f3c4807e1261719c90e2b312a","title":"corbyn under pressure momentum give members vote labour brexit policy","story":"Supporters from leftwing group Momentum press for debate at party conferenceSupporters of Jeremy Corbyn from the leftwing campaign group Momentum are piling pressure on the leadership this weekend to give members a debate and vote on Labour’s Brexit policy in a move that will further expose the party’s deep isions over Europe.Several prominent figures on the left have told the Observer that it will be unacceptable – and reminiscent of the worst elements of Tony Blair’s leadership – if policy is decided behind closed doors. They are demanding that Brexit is fully discussed and voted on by delegates at the Labour party conference in Liverpool in September. The gathering will take place before any vote by MPs in parliament on the outcome of negotiations between Theresa May and Brussels.The calls for involvement of the mass membership come as the leadership faces growing pressure from Labour MPs, peers and members to take a more pro-EU, pro-single-market approach as the main political parties prepare for a series of crucial Commons votes on the EU withdrawal bill in less than three weeks.A spokesman for Momentum said the organisation remained supportive of the leadership on Brexit. But, increasingly, elements within Momentum and the trade union movement are demanding the right to be heard on the most important policy issue of the day, in line with Corbyn’s repeated pledges to involve members at every turn. The Trades Union Congress is expected to intensify its demands for the party to back staying in the single market in the coming months.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Rida Vaquas, a former member of Momentum’s national coordinating group, said: “The left has always stood against stage-managed conferences from the days of Blair, where decisions of substance are made behind closed doors whilst party members are given no chances to have robust debates on the direction of our party.“A Corbyn-led Labour party can only be strengthened by vigorous discussion among our own ranks, on our political differences as well as what unites us. How we approach Brexit is an issue of decisive importance and it is therefore only right it is debated at conference. Socialists can never succeed by dodging political questions, only by facing them head on.”Michael Chessum, who was on Momentum’s first steering committee in 201617 and is now national organiser of the leftwing anti-Brexit group Another Europe is Possible, said: “Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour leadership are principled people.“They have spent decades fighting for democracy in the party and against the idea that important decisions can be made in smoky backrooms by officials. So I’m confident that they will support the right of members to democratically debate issues as pivotal as Brexit and free movement. There should be a consensus around that.“Labour isn’t negotiating this deal, and the closer we get to exit day, the clearer it gets that the Tories’ Brexit agenda is going to be a disaster for the rights, freedoms and prosperity of working-class people and the communities that Labour and the left are supposed to represent. It is urgent that we clearly place an alternative to Brexit on the table – one linked to a radical vision for society under a Corbyn-led Labour government.”At last year’s Labour conference in Brighton, Momentum and some of the unions joined forces to prevent the Brexit issue being debated in order to avoid exposing the party split and embarrassing the relatively Eurosceptic Corbyn. At the time, many of his MPs and peers were pushing for him to back permanent membership of the single market.This year the arguments over Brexit look likely to be even more heated and calls for a debate will be far more difficult to resist in September, when the date of the UK’s departure will be less than six months away.Another Momentum member, Omar Raii, who sits on the London Young Labour committee and is a former NUS national executive committee member, said: “On an issue as big as this it would be unacceptable if we decided to determine our policy behind closed doors. It would be the worst kind of Blairite approach.“It’s hugely important that Labour members democratically thrash out policy at conference on all issues, especially one as huge as Brexit. I hope to see Labour articulate a genuinely internationalist policy that opposes the reactionary, anti-migrant plans the Tories have for us.”At a recent conference of the centre-left grouping Progess, nine candidates for Labour’s national executive committee launched the campaign LabourSay.EU to push for a meaningful vote on Brexit at the Labour conference.Earlier this month, student unions representing almost 1 million young people studying at UK colleges and universities signed a statement calling for a “people’s vote” or second referendum on the final deal negotiated by May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6c24875c4e1028a75d3cdff315845588865bfb/0_50_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c75164e20a6c82e149eb240d856dc01","title":"labour live festival corbyn unite","story":"Labour’s biggest union backer is giving away a thousand tickets to an event billed as Jeremy Corbyn’s very own Glastonbury, amid serious fears that it will lead to major losses for the party.Unite announced to members that it was giving away the tickets and even offered free travel to the event in London for those who need it.It follows recent reports that ticket sales for the Labour Live Festival have been sluggish, with only 2,500 of the 15,000 seats sold for the event at White Hart Lane in north London on Saturday 16 June. Full-priced tickets cost £35.Some insiders are worried that the party could be in for a seven-figure loss unless action is taken, though Labour officially denies such a loss is on the cards. Unite, whose general secretary Len McCluskey has been one of Corbyn’s most powerful allies, has now stepped in to help boost the numbers.“If you are quick you have the chance to book a free ticket for the event,” the union said in a message to members. “Unite have 1,000 tickets to give away on a first-come first-served basis … Contact your local Labour party regional office to find out about the free travel services we’re providing.”The Labour Live event has struggled to attract big-name acts, but it will feature Hookworms, the Magic Numbers, Rae Morris and Jermain Jackman. The event was designed to benefit from the adulation Corbyn received when he appeared at other live events, including Glastonbury last year.A Labour spokeswoman said: “Labour Live is one of the ways we’re continuing to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour’s message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few.

Yet strangely after three weeks of vicious riding, the last significant skirmish on the way to Cervinia saw barely a blow attempted – at least on the road.Off it, however, it was a different story. For while Froome was cheered on by the majority of the huge crowd, he was also reminded that not everyone believes in him as one spectator rushed out and spat at him three kilometres from the finish. Afterwards Froome said that he had not seen the incident. But his team-mate Wout Poels certainly did, looking around in understandable horror.Froome also faced more questions about his stunning solo victory on Friday – with one reporter asking whether, unlike other great performances in the past such as Floyd Landis at the 2006 Tour de France, it would stand the test of time.“I can understand the parallels and comparisons being drawn by some people,” he replied.“But I have every confidence it will stand.” He also said that, contrary to some reports, his race data from Friday’s stage – where he reckoned he rode an average of 350 watts for three hours – was available to race organisers.“I’d be very surprised if the data isn’t there,” he added. “I have been riding around with an extra 100 metregram receiver of theirs the last three weeks. I’d be disappointed if they don’t have the data.”Froome also pledged, yet again, that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing after being found with double the permitted levels of salbutamol in his system at the Vuelta last September – as first revealed by the . “I have a clear conscience,” he said. “When the time is right, all the information will be shared with everyone and I am sure people will see it from my point of view.”For now, though, Froome wants to purely focus on celebrating becoming the first man in 35 years to hold all three grand tours – the Tour de France, the Vuelta a España and the Giro – at the same time, joining Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx in the pantheon.True, there is still one more stage remaining. But the 10 laps of 11.5km around Rome on Sunday evening will be largely processional. To Froome, each one will feel like a fresh victory parade.“It is a very special win,” said Froome. “I know it is not over until Rome but the battle is over now. But there were so many moments when it was extremely hard.”And while beaming from ear to ear, he admitted that there were times he didn’t think his fifth grand tour victory was on the cards.“Obviously the crash right before the prologue in Jerusalem really knocked my confidence, and I was in a lot of pain after that,” he said. “And there were also days where I should have finished in front and I didn’t and I lost time so there have been so many hurdles to overcome. And as we have seen from some, when you have a bad day in these last few days of the Giro you don’t just lose minutes, you can lose tens of minutes.“But my team-mates and the support staff believed in me. They said: ‘Wait, this race is brutal and you are going to get to the last few days and the race can really change.’ And it did.”That was evident on stage 20 as the Frenchman Thibaut Pinot, who started the day in third, lost a staggering 45 minutes – a similar amount that Simon Yates lost on Friday. Froome, however, never looked in any danger of letting slip the 40 seconds he had over his nearest challenger Tom Dumoulin.In theory, the 214km from Susa to Cervinia looked to possess sharp enough teeth to make Froome fear its bite. The final 90km had three climbs, each amounting to almost 20km in duration – with 4,000m of rise and fall along the way. Yet he was only rarely tested and never troubled. After three weeks where he had looked short of his best, Froome the Imperious was back.While the Spaniard Mikel Nieve pulled away on the final climb to celebrate his 34th birthday with a stage win, Froome focused purely on man-marking Dumoulin up the Col Tsecore and then the Col St-Pantaléon.Finally with six kilometres remaining on the road to Cervinia, Dumoulin went for it, attacking three times in rapid succession only to find Froome locked onto his wheel each time he looked over his shoulder. “I gave everything I had,” said Dumoulin. “He was too strong for me. I have no regrets.”Not only was it not enough, but Froome actually looked stronger than ever towards the finish. Indeed, as he made his way over the steepest stretch of the final climb, just before Valtournenche three kilometres out, he powered clear of Dumoulin in a defiant show of strength. As he did so he passed bunches of pink Giro d’Italia balloons, some of which had been popped.A few days ago, when he was fourth in the race and struggling with saddle sores, Froome had looked similarly deflated. But, once again, he and Team Sky somehow found the resolve to deliver when it mattered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c88a40baaafe69ac78bd56e5facc8aba9466b33/0_445_5330_3198/master/5330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a8c57c6c04b23dd1da31a55b255ef4","title":"daniel ricciardo takes monaco f1 pole from vettel with hamilton third","story":"Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo went into this weekend’s Monaco Grand Prix publicly seeking redemption for the team error that cost him an almost certain win here two years ago. His journey is not yet over and Monaco can bite in the most unforgiving fashion but with an absolutely emphatic pole position the Australian has given himself every chance finally to banish the bad memories.Ricciardo delivered pole, only the second of his career having started from the top spot in the ill-fated 2016 race, with an exemplary lap that topped a weekend where no one has been able to match him. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was in second and Lewis Hamilton, who leads the German by 17 points in the world championship, was in third.Ricciardo’s first hot lap in Q3 was a full four-tenths clear of his rivals. It was a masterclass in Monaco and, although he could not improve on his second run, he did not need to. Vettel could only close the deficit to two-tenths, with Hamilton four-tenths back. He topped every session in practice and qualifying and in doing so set a new track record on six occasions.While the Australian was pleased, he was aware there was work to be done. “The race is tomorrow and then we will celebrate,” he said. “There is still a lot of fire in this belly. I’ve done everything I can so far. Let’s finish the job tomorrow. I’m pumped.”After the session he was on the phone to Red Bull’s owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, who was doubtless as pleased at Ricciardo’s performance as he would have been disappointed at his team-mate Max Verstappen’s.For a driver with such promise, Verstappen’s record at Monaco is poor. Having crashed three times across three visits, he once again put his Red Bull in the wall in final practice, an incident almost identical to his accident in qualifying in 2016. The team had to replace the gearbox but were unable to do so in time for qualifying and he will start from the back of the grid.Verstappen has now been involved in incidents at all six races this season. He was defensive here but held his hands up to the error. “I got caught off guard by a slow car but that is no excuse,” he said. “I have to look to myself. I made the mistake myself.”Hamilton, meanwhile, had warned of Red Bull’s threat and was not overly surprised Mercedes were outpaced. He and the team were happy they had extracted all they could from the car. “We did the best we could the car wasn’t good enough,” he said. “I gave it everything I could but you can’t always get everything perfect. But the car is in one piece so we live to fight another day.”The race is likely to be a one-stop and Vettel acknowledged he had to make the most of the run to Sainte Dévote. “I would to like to jump Daniel at the start,” he said. “It is nearly impossible to overtake. The plan is to do a good start and keep the pressure on to the end.”Kimi Räikkönen was in fourth, with Valtteri Bottas in fifth. McLaren’s Fernando Alonso was in seventh place. The Force India’s of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez were in sixth and ninth respectively, with the Renault of Carlos Sainz in eighth and the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly in tenth.Romain Grosjean in the Haas was in 15th place but will take a three-place grid penalty after causing an accident at the last round in Spain. Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in 11th in front of the McLaren of Stoffel Vandoorne. Sergey Sirotkin in the Williams was in 13th, with Charles Leclerc’s Sauber in 14th.Brendon Hartley in the Toro Rosso was in 16th with Sauber’s Marcus Ericsson in 17th. Williams’ Lance Stroll was in 18th, in front of the Haas of Kevin Magnussen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b5007b6d49922e88421945f3bcabfe216f3904/13_0_2007_1204/master/2007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14d9ca4d0f0504665c1d1fb5ded41599","title":"exeter saracens premiership play off final match report","story":"It was apt that Chris Wyles signed off his Saracens career with two tries after another final in which the team that had finished first came second. Exeter lacked the wiles of their opponents, sticking to the possession formula that has brought them so much reward this season without taking ownership of the game after the opening 10 minutes.Sarries did not touch the ball in that time, apart from Sean Maitland dropping Nic White’s box-kick, but it was the period when the match was won and lost. As Exeter took play through phase after phase, Saracens met them head-on, protecting the gainline by fanning out and rarely competing for possession at the breakdown to allow them to rush up.Exeter were being pushed backwards but kept coming, not tweaking their approach beyond the odd off-load. They had failed to beat Leinster in two attempts in the European Champions Cup in December and it is not so much that they lack a plan B but that their A game needs more variation, a kick here or there or a long pass to bring Henry Slade in from the\u0026nbspcold.They were predictable while Saracens had Alex Goode. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, was among the spectators, but he would not have been scrutinising a full-back he jettisoned two years ago. It was, though, Goode who, following Exeter’s early dominance, created the opening try after 13 minutes when chasing Owen Farrell’s chip and, with a mixture of determination and luck, beating four defenders to the ball. Saracens were able to run at a defence scrambling into position and – after moving the ball wide – they used their forwards to rumble to the line for Billy Vunipola to claim his first try of a season badly disrupted by injury.It was their first attack and the next one produced their second try with Goode again at its core.He appeared at second receiver outside Farrell and after taking the ball ran an outside arc that prevented the defence from fanning out wide. He timed his pass to Alex Lozowski and Wyles was left with a run-in on the left wing. The move was almost repeated in the final two minutes when Nathan Earle, Wyles’s replacement, completed the scoring and it was the ability of Saracens to work players into space rather than seek contact that set them apart.They did have one jittery period at the end of the third quarter when Exeter, having made a raft of changes, including their entire front row, stiffened up their scrum and used a penalty won up front to drive a line-out. When it was collapsed by Schalk Brits close to the Saracens line, the hooker, making his final appearance for the club at the age of 37, was sent to the sin-bin.Exeter – 19-3 down at that stage after Wyles’s second try six minutes into the second period – sensed the turning of the tide.Dave Ewers was held up over the line and from the resulting scrum, Gareth Steenson used the threat of Olly Woodburn outside him to dummy his way over, and the Chiefs’ supporters found their voice. The champions had won the final 10 matches of the season in all competitions while Sarries had overcome their worst run this decade when they lost seven consecutive matches in November and December.Saracens kept true to themselves in adversity and here, nine points ahead but with Brits having another seven minutes in the sin-bin, their season was on the line. The last year they had failed to win a trophy was 2014 and nothing was going to deflect them. Having 14 players was barely a disadvantage because Mako Vunipola, again, was playing with the force of two in his 32nd appearance of the season having started all three Lions Tests in New Zealand.Vunipola carried the ball for 38 metres, more than any other forward on a hot, humid afternoon, and he made 18 tackles while helping establish his side’s early superiority up front where he won two penalties out of Tomas Francis, a tight-head not often found in reverse gear. He was given the last five minutes off and had just enough strength to trudge off the field to a standing ovation.It was a match between two teams renowned for their collective strength, but a difference was the influence exerted by some of their noted iniduals, led by Mako Vunipola. Farrell, until he developed cramp, was excellent in defence, along with his captain Brad Barritt, Maro Itoje was at his marauding best and Jackson Wray timed his interventions at the breakdown.And there was Goode, the player Exeter could have done with. His England career is said to have fizzled out because of a lack of pace, but his speed of thought was such here that he was able to exploit a defence that was too often narrow. He would fix an opponent and manoeuvre a team-mate into space where the Chiefs tended to run at bodies.Saracens used to be regarded as roundheads. They have not gone all cavalier, but they have their moments, wily enough to regain the crown they lost in Exeter last year and they have the summer to figure out how to topple Leinster in Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0caf4aa36f624622667fd42879ce3e4f52094f60/0_279_5499_3299/master/5499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6f469deb82eab66e22cb7331ada5c12","title":"the baroque delights of antwerp","story":"Historic Antwerp is opening its gilded stucco doors to lovers of Europe’s most decadent styleAntwerp was once the mighty cog that turned world trade. Sitting at the mouth of the River Scheldt, it dominated international 16th-century markets in sugar, spices and textiles. Today it is still an improbably cosmopolitan place for its size, but is better known for its international diamond business and, less alluringly, as the port that sucks in more cocaine than any other. It recently overtook London as cocaine capital of Europe.The city was also famed for its great Flemish art, from the huge religious panels of Rubens to the royal portraits by Van Dyck and all those detailed still life tables, laden with silverware, meat and fruit.In the past few years, the run of hit historical novels and dramas set in the dimly lit, 17th-century luxury of the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) has raised its profile, too. Mysterious romances, including The Girl with the Pearl Earring, Tulip Fever and The Miniaturist, have all helped to remind us how intriguing this moneyed part of northern Europe once was.Next weekend (1-3 June), Antwerp is to seize upon just one word to help it celebrate its creative history: baroque. These days it often implies something deemed too ornate, but four centuries ago the baroque movement swept in on a surge of Catholic decorative excess that has left a deep imprint on Antwerp’s architecture. “Antwerp Baroque 2018” will be exploring these themes in a series of art events around the city.Most visitors head for the famous Grote Markt – the main square in the old quarter – but I was just as bowled over by the carefully restored homes of a former 17th-century mayor, Nicolaas Rockox, and his neighbour, the painter Frans Snijders, both brimming with baroque self-confidence. Snijders was well known for painting snarling dogs, dead game carcasses and exotic birds.More squeamish tourists may want to focus on the ornate vases of flowers painted by Clara Peeters – a once-famous Flemish artist born at the turn of the 16th century who is only now being recognised again. (When Madrid’s Prado showed her work in 2016, she became the first female artist to have a solo exhibition there.)The baroque mood continues at full tilt inside the nearby church of St Charles Borromeo, packed with sweeping gestures and the theatricality of the age. If you have ever been underwhelmed in Britain by the pared-down aesthetic of a draughty church, then this house of prayer in Antwerp is the antidote. The carved woodwork of the pulpit and the sculpted Carrara marble in the chapels are a lesson in 17th-century bling.The big draw here though is Peter Paul Rubens’s panel Return of the Holy Family from Jerusalem which the church bought back at auction six years ago so that it could be returned to its position at the left of the altar, where the artist wanted it.A fluffy Belgian waffle, or perhaps a pint of blonde beer at Den Engel on the Grote Markt, is probably the right way to regain strength for the next leg of the baroque tour. It would be silly to leave out Rubens’s own home, which is being especially renovated for the summer. His imposing Italianate arch will soon be revealed in its original wonder. And his glamorous self-portrait, a kind of promotional calling card, is newly on display in pride of place, although it had to compete for public interest on the morning I was there with the Tintoretto that David Bowie owned. The most impressive show for Rubens fans, however, lies inside the cathedral that rises above the rest of the old city.For some baroque light refreshment try Elfde Gebod bar and café just next to the cathedral. The interior is awash with gilt and religious icons alongside an impressive range of Belgium beers.Beyond the city are the green spaces of Middelheim, a favourite of the old rich burghers of Antwerp who would come here to escape the crush of the port. Now it’s Europe’s first permanent sculpture garden set over 30 acres. With two large wooded areas separated by a road, it is dotted with famous forms, from a Henry Moore and a Barbara Hepworth, to Antony Gormley’s metallic astronomical web. Next month these sculptures will be joined by a new set of commissions dubbed “Experience Traps” as part of the festival.The ultimate antidote to a baroque-filled day is an evening meal in the restaurant RAS (restaurant on the stream), an airy, modern and minimalist interior on the riverbank, with views across the river through an expanse of floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The food is similarly pared back: a fine blend of nouvelle cuisine and traditional dishes.Walking back through the Grote Markt afterwards, I noticed that the Brabo fountain in the middle of the square features a man holding a severed hand in a grim reference to the myth of the giant who lopped off sailors’ hands and hurled them into the Scheldt. The story is also remembered in the shape of the chocolates and biscuits sold all over the city. Somehow it seems an essentially baroque detail. After all, the word baroque derives from the idea of an “imperfect pearl”: something lustrous with a beguiling flaw.Eurostar trains from London via Brussels to Antwerp’s baroque main station cost from £70 return.

Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2cecdc043738e91561632fa9822476a60421e7e/590_476_3037_1822/master/3037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31bee2535774eecb862b5df2a269b61a","title":"chelsea clinton vitriol flung at me","story":"The former first daughter on privilege, female leadership, dealing with critics, and how Trump ‘degrades what it means to be American’When the American media describe Chelsea Clinton as royalty, they refer not to her popularity but to her ubiquity. Her very first home was the governor’s mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas the family home she left for university 18 years later was the White House. Ordinarily, it’s only young royals who grow up in lavish official residences and the pitiless media spotlight, a permanent presence in our consciousness. It is a uniquely strange and unenviable version of celebrity that stole Clinton’s anonymity before she was old enough to spell it.When we meet there is, therefore, a disconcerting sense of deja vu. Everything begins exactly as one might expect. On the previous day there had been the pre-interview call from one of her handlers, who was ostensibly warm and yet conveyed an impression of wary control, leaving me worried about how far I’d be allowed to stray from the subject of Clinton’s new book. The interview takes place at the Clinton Foundation, a vast but discreetly unadvertised expanse of midtown Manhattan office space populated by serious-looking people and elegantly adorned by African-inspired artwork chosen by Clinton’s father. Clinton is waiting in the glass boardroom the interview starts precisely on schedule, to the second.The 38-year-old displays impressive fluency in British current affairs, knowing all about the NHS’s missed mammogram test results, and praising David Lammy’s recent Windrush speech in the Commons. Her father once talked about the importance of really seeing people – the person who opens his car door, or pours his coffee – and I’m struck that Clinton notices the medical support sleeve I’m wearing, and asks about the origins of the name Decca. But any impression of intimacy is offset by a facial expression that remains glassily still, and a voice that never modulates. Clinton has inherited her mother’s unnerving composure, and speaks in monotone paragraphs consisting almost entirely of language no human being I know ever uses. “The choices that they made,” for example, “were fundamental to me feeling affirmed in charting my own journey”, which is not how anyone else talks about their mum and dad.Clinton has just published her third children’s book, and will be appearing at the Hay festival next weekend. She Persisted Around The World is a picture book in which she tells the stories of 13 extraordinary women through the ages, from Marie Curie to Malala Yousafzai, who persevered in the face of prejudice and changed history. It’s the sequel to her New York Times bestseller She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World, the title inspired by Republican senator Mitch McConnell’s scathing attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren for trying to read aloud a letter from Martin Luther King Jr’s widow in the senate. Warren was famously silenced, under an obscure senate rule that McConnell later defended with: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” only for his words to be swiftly converted into a feminist rallying cry.Clinton is completely right, of course. But later, listening back to my tape, I notice that when I say it feels important to me for my sons to know these stories, she responds with: “Thank you for framing it around both our daughters and our sons.” A few minutes later, when I tell her I took them to see Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle In Time, which features a geeky female protagonist who’s good at maths, Clinton replies: “I’m really grateful that you took your sons to see it.” Her odd construction of gratitude (most people would say, “Oh, well done,” or “That’s great!”) means that – even when we’re agreeing – it can feel hard to connect.She has talked in the past about inheriting her maternal grandmother’s “responsibility gene”, and mentions to me that her daughter’s nursery has been encouraging conversations about the concept of fairness. “It gives us the chance to talk with her about what is fair, and that she already has unfair advantages because of who her parents are. I don’t think she really understands the concept of privilege yet, but I want her to be able to understand that as soon as she’s old enough to. So we can start having larger conversations about privilege, and about the clear responsibility that comes with privilege. It’s also about kindness and respect.”My guess is that Clinton feels unable to say something as simple as “Oh, well done”, for fear of sounding superior. The unfortunate irony is that her thanks, intended to convey humility, end up making her seem either inauthentic or grand.It’s just a tiny glimpse into the lifelong impossibility of being Chelsea Clinton. At elementary school in Arkansas, her teacher called her precocious – “and it wasn’t meant as a compliment” – though her parents told her it was “a very good thing”. She’d begun reading newspapers when she was just four, “and my parents expected me to have an opinion about what I thought the most important stories were, and then to be able to muster an argument in support of what I thought was right or wrong. They taught me early on the difference between opinion and fact. A crucial distinction,” she adds dryly, “that seems to be not as appreciated at the moment by some, unfortunately.”Just 12 when she moved into the White House, an awkward adolescent jumble of frizzy hair and braces, Clinton was 18 when the father she idolised confessed to an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Two hundred and fifty journalists covered her arrival at Stanford University, where she was criticised for keeping a low profile, hidden away in her bulletproof dorm, but then criticised again for partying with celebrities when she moved to Oxford for an MPhil in international relations. She tried working for management consultants McKinsey, and then a hedge fund, but her heart wasn’t in it as she has said, “I tried to care about things like money. I just didn’t.”Following another master’s in public health she became a special correspondent for NBC, but was widely panned, one critic describing the decision to hire her as “journalistically bankrupt”. New York magazine ran the headline: “Chelsea Clinton at NBC: When Nepotism Goes Wrong”.The caution with which she parses my questions is therefore unsurprising. Now vice-chair of the family foundation, she seems to have found a public voice and role that fits, campaigning for girls’ empowerment, early access to childhood education and global healthcare initiatives – but even so, for the first half of the interview she sounds more like a policy paper than a real person.And then, quite unexpectedly, something changes. Feminist opinion is ided, I observe, between women who feel we should seize this #MeToo moment and go all out to tear down the patriarchy, and those who fear our rage will alienate support. Does Clinton still believe we should go high? She gazes at me in silence, as though making up her mind whether or not to become present, and when she opens her mouth it feels as if she is suddenly here.“For me, maybe because I’ve had so much vitriol flung at me for as long as I can literally remember, people saying awful things to me even as a child, I’ve never found it productive, personally, to engage in that way. To retaliate with crass language or insult someone personally – I just don’t think I’m built that way.”Does she tell herself they’re not really talking about her? “Oh, no,” she flashes back, with a low chuckle. “I know they’re talking about me. I just think that the way they’re talking about me, to me, to my face, online, is a reflection on them and not about me. The savagery that is directed at me, sometimes it’s because I’m just the person that they happen to see and recognise, and they’re angry, and so that anger kind of spills out. Sometimes they’re mad at me because of something that my mum or dad did, or something that my mum or dad never did – but they have been fed the narrative that they were trafficking children, or drugs, or some other heinous crime.”She used to believe the right thing to do about “all of the meanness” was simply ignore it, she reflects. “Now I’ve come to feel differently, because I think that the way that our president and many people around him have not only mainstreamed hate, but mainlined it, is so deeply dangerous.” Her eyes fill with dismay as she cites the rising reports of bullying in schools catalogued by the Southern Poverty Law Centre. “Not just the hundreds but now thousands of instances in schools across America, where children are citing the president as they’re demeaning a little girl, or they’re chanting ‘Build a wall’ in an attempt to demean and degrade brown children. So the reason, now, I no longer ignore it when people say hateful things to me on the street or on social media is, I think we have to shine a light. I think those of us who have platforms to do that have to say this is wrong and unacceptable, so we don’t normalise it but try to detoxify what has been unleashed. Because if we don’t, we leave a vacuum. And I think the darkness fills that vacuum.”I tell her a lot of people in Britain are wondering how they should receive Trump’s visit in July. What’s her advice? “Well, I’ve been to multiple protests since the election. Charlotte’s been to at least three, maybe four. Aidan’s been to one. If I lived in Britain I would show up to protest, because I don’t agree with what he’s doing to degrade what it means to be an American.”We are meeting two days after a smiling Ivanka Trump opened the US embassy in Jerusalem, as dozens of Palestinians were massacred. I ask if Clinton feels any sympathy for the first daughter, obliged to do her father’s grotesque bidding, or considers her complicit. Her expression hardens.“She’s an adult. She can make the choices for herself. I mean, she’s 36. We are responsible for our choices. In 2008 I was really proud to support my mum – but I disagreed with her fundamentally on a few things, particularly her then opposition to equal marriage rights for LGBTQ Americans. I never defended that position, because it wasn’t what I believed was the right thing to do.”Ivanka and Chelsea used to be friends, and seemed to have much in common: famous and powerful parents young families and busy jobs in Manhattan. In 2015 Clinton told American Vogue, “She’s always aware of everyone around her and ensuring that everyone is enjoying the moment. It’s an awareness that in some ways reminds me of my dad, and his ability to increase the joy of the room. There’s nothing skin-deep about Ivanka.” The friendship somehow survived the election campaign, but not Trump’s presidency the pair haven’t formally fallen out, but Clinton says they haven’t spoken in “a long time”.Were Ivanka to succeed her father in the White House, as some have speculated, would the election of the first female president still constitute a triumph for feminism? “Well, I didn’t support Sarah Palin when she was the vice-president nominee in 2008. And I hope my son is as much a feminist as my daughter. I think it is more about what we stand for, and how we do it, than the gender of the person there.” With the exception of Barron – “He’s 12 let him be 12, please” – she has no sympathy whatsoever for Trump’s children. “They’re adults who’ve made the decision to work in this administration.” Had her mother been elected, she says she would never have gone to work for her, so I ask if she shares others’ distaste at Trump employing his family.“I think the president should be able to hire whoever he or she thinks are best qualified. I do not believe that many of the people that he has hired have been qualified to do the jobs. Not only do I want an administration that isn’t venal, corrupt and focused on making life harder for millions of Americans, I also want a competent administration. So for me, the larger question is the collision of cruelty and incompetence and corruption that we see across the administration.”Given her father’s track record, I’m curious to know how she would feel if Stormy Daniels were to take down the presidency. “I haven’t followed that as closely as I have everything that’s emerging around the Russia investigation. But I do think it’s important that no one is above the law, and so whatever investigations come out of what Mueller’s doing, or the other ways in which many people are attempting to hold the president accountable, I think it’s important that those continue.” Following the scenes in Charlottesville last summer, she must have considered the danger of violence if Trump’s supporters feel he is unduly hounded out of office. The spectacle of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Klansmen marching through the Virginia town last August, bearing torches and swastikas, sent shockwaves through America and cost one counter-protester her life. When Trump declared there were “fine people” marching on the Unite The Right rally, to many frightened Americans the nation’s politics felt profoundly and ominously altered. Just how febrile does Clinton consider the situation? She looks grave. “Quite, I think.”Her assistant announces that our time is up, and I turn my recorder off, but Clinton tells me to turn it back on. Now that she’s really here, she wants to keep talking.Since Barbara Bush died, she says, she’s thought a lot about the importance of intentions. “I disagreed with her husband on so much, and with her on so much. But I also never doubted that she believed what she and her husband were fighting for was going to be to the benefit of most Americans. She really believed that what they were doing was the right thing to do.“I used to believe all that mattered was the bottom line of the outcome, like, how many lives were improved, how many people were saved, how many more people got to go to school without debt, how many people had healthcare, how many women got to have paid maternity leave. I still believe that is what matters most. But I also now believe that intentions and tone and decency matter, because I think the wreckage that we’re seeing at this moment is one that will, I hope, be repaired on the policy standpoint when we elect Democrats. But I think we will still then have work to do on repairing the tone in our country, the exposure of the real racist and sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic and antisemitic feeling which is on the rise in our country – a rot that has been exposed.”We are well over time now, and I glance at her assistant, but Clinton hasn’t finished. “I think one of the big mistakes,” she continues, “was, for so long, we focused on tolerance, which I just think is insufficient. People tolerated casual misogyny, but casual misogyny is maybe the gateway drug. We have freedom of speech, which I do think is hugely important – and yet people thought you couldn’t dispute hateful things, because they’re like – well, it’s freedom of speech. Well, freedom of speech doesn’t mean there is freedom of consequences.“Sure, you should not be in prison because you said something racist. But you also shouldn’t be able to run for president. And yet here we are.”She Persisted Around The World, published by Philomel Books, is available at the  bookshop for £9.99 (discounted from £12.99).

The three explosions, which began around 12.42am, came during the fourth week of what geologists rank as one of the biggest eruption cycles from the Big Island volcano in a century.Residents downwind of Kilauea were advised by County of Hawaii Civil Defense to avoid exposure to ash, which can cause eye irritation and breathing difficulties, particularly in people with respiratory problems. Some 25 miles down Kilauea’s east flank, lava gushed from six giant cracks. Molten rock from two fissures advanced over a street of homes in the Leilani Estates housing development, the observatory said. The number of houses and other structures destroyed by lava flows in the island’s lower Puna district leapt to 82 on Friday, from a previous count of 50 after fissures reactivated in Leilani Estates this week. Another lava flow near the rural housing development slowed and was 150 yards from Pohoiki Road where there are dozens more homes, the observatory said. Around 2,000 residents of Leilani Estates and nearby Lanipuna Gardens remained under evacuation orders due to lava flows and high levels of toxic sulfur dioxide gas from volcanic vents. Contingency plans have been made for a possible helicopter evacuation of up to 1,000 residents in a coastal area south of the fissures should their last exit route be blocked by lava or become unsafe due to gaping cracks, officials said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ebd7fa4548cdf6f1f3f3b9e47abc1f5f1b9ae2/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8fad87b974dd6d587375c7113a55a3a","title":"charlatan miracle cure italy populist new government five star movement league","story":"Can Giuseppe Conte, who first made news in a notorious medical case, really heal his country?In 2013, a young Italian girl named Sofia De Barros became the public face of an emotive campaign that called for people with degenerative diseases to be given access to an untested and controversial stem-cell therapy, which was promoted by a psychologist who claimed it could work miracles.De Barros’s family, defended by a lawyer called Giuseppe Conte, went to court to demand that their daughter, suffering from a terminal illness that leads to paralysis and blindness, be given the so-called “Stamina” treatment, over the concerns and objections of scientists and doctors who warned that it was unproven and possibly dangerous.One of the voices at the centre of the gut-wrenching fight was a burgeoning political party called the Five Star Movement, which had seized on De Barros’s story as an example of how Italy’s “establishment” was hurting ordinary citizens by keeping a “cure” out of reach. Stamina was “effective” and deserved further research, the party claimed in a press release at the time, because “citizens” believed that it was. Beppe Grillo, one of the Five Star Movement (M5S) founders, who has also supported unproven cures for cancer, used his popular blog to support pro-Stamina protests.In fact, Stamina was later proved to be a con, and the psychologist behind the treatment, Davide Vannoni, was convicted of conspiracy and fraud.The controversy came under fresh scrutiny last week after Conte, the family’s lawyer who supported Stamina, was plucked out of obscurity and named as Italy’s next prime minister by a new coalition government led by Five Star, now Italy’s largest party, and the far-right League.Conte was chosen, despite his lack of any political experience, by two leaders – Luigi Di Maio of Five Star and Matteo Salvini of the League – because they could not agree on anyone else. Hours after Conte got the green light to form a government, chaos ensued. The two parties have been squabbling over who to put in the cabinet. One of the people Conte wishes to appoint is Paolo Savona, his proposed finance minister, a vociferous critic of the euro, which he has called a “German cage”. But that choice is being resisted by the president, Sergio Mattarella.The development roiled Italian markets on Friday and has deeply worried Brussels, in large part because one of the few things Five Star and the League agree on is their distrust of the EU.The wrangling appears to be centred on a disagreement on just how Eurosceptic the new government ought to be. “There is an institutional grammar that has to be rewritten,” said Giovanni Orsina, a political historian at Luiss University in Rome. “This conflict is something we might have expected, because President Mattarella – installed by the former prime minister, Matteo Renzi – belongs to the old majority and the populists are impatient when it comes to checks and balances dictated by the Italian constitution.”The two populist parties cobbled together a coalition following an election on 4 March that resulted in a hung parliament. It plans to raise spending, slash taxes and possibly install a finance minister who believes that Italy’s entry into the eurozone was a “historical mistake”. Beyond the question of what this means for Italy and the EU, the parties’ rise to power could have a profound impact on Italy’s institutions, which have already come under attack. The Stamina episode gives a hint of what Italians – and the world – might expect.The League was in a coalition with Silvio Berlusconi from 1994, but under a different leadership. Five Star has never been in government. They both have a long history of embracing the unorthodox, supporting conspiracy theories, and challenging institutions that have traditionally been seen as the bedrock of Italian society. Now, after years of serving as parties of “no” against the former centre-left government, Five Star and the League are in charge.Emma Bonino, a former foreign minister who now serves as a senator for a party that supports the EU and defends the rights of migrants, told the Observer that there were plenty of elements of the parties’ joint agenda to be frightened of, especially policies against migrants. But she also noted their resistance to political norms.“They consider the institutions to be their property. I think that this is the basic problem,” said Bonino. Asked about the Stamina episode and the parties’ criticism of mandatory vaccinations, she added: “The anti-scientific mood is very big.”When Mattarella failed to immediately give his blessing to Conte’s nomination as prime minister, in part because questions had arisen about whether the law professor had padded his academic credentials, the move was immediately lambasted by a senior Five Star official, Alessandro Di\u0026nbspBattista.On Facebook, Di Battista warned Mattarella against serving as a “lawyer for those who oppose change” and on Twitter, he called on supporters to back Conte and put pressure on the president, who is rarely criticised by political leaders and is meant to be politically neutral.Di Battista’s father also took to social media and, in an attention-grabbing post, warned that if people got angry “the palace of President Mattarella may become like the\u0026nbspBastille”.In the run-up to the vote on 4\u0026nbspMarch analysts noted that in some ways both Five Star and the League – formerly the secessionist and xenophobic Northern League – sought to appear more mainstream in some of their views. For example, while both parties have been extremely critical of mandatory vaccinations, both sought to play down this position, despite Five Star holding rallies in the past that called on all parents to have a choice in whether their children be\u0026nbspvaccinated.Jacopo Iacoboni, a journalist at La Stampa who has closely followed Five Star, said that Di Maio had begun to present himself as being more moderate, but that he believed the populists were still wedded to their unorthodox theories, in part because it has been a strong draw for voters.“It has been a useful way for Five Star to attack any established expertise,” Iacoboni said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d8fb5a0de76a168e65e2735f7c0e718b6091969/0_348_3619_2171/master/3619.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6e9bd4dfea9da4ac99c76d452b736c","title":"british arms exports israel new record","story":"British defence contractors are selling record amounts of arms to Israel, new figures reveal, just days after it was confirmed that Prince William will represent the UK government on a visit to the country next month.Figures from the Campaign Against Arms Trade reveal that last year the UK issued £221m worth of arms licences to defence companies exporting to Israel. This made Israel the UK’s eighth largest market for UK arms companies, a huge increase on the previous year’s figure of £86m, itself a substantial rise on the £20m worth of arms licensed in 2015. In total, over the past five years, Israel has bought more than £350m worth of UK military hardware.Licences issued to UK defence contractors exporting to Israel last year include those for targeting equipment, small arms ammunition, missiles, weapon sights and sniper rifles. In 2016 the UK issued licences for anti-armour ammunition, gun mountings, components for air-to-air missiles, targeting equipment, components for assault rifles, components for grenade-launchers and anti-riot shields.Human rights groups have questioned the wisdom of sending a senior royal to a country whose use of lethal force last month has been the subject of concern from the UK\u0026nbspgovernment.“After the appallingly excessive response of the Israeli security forces at the Gaza border, tensions in the occupied Palestinian territories are likely to be close to boiling point when Prince William makes this historic visit,” said Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s campaigns director.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended Israel’s response, saying “every country has an obligation to defend its borders”. But Theresa May backed calls for an independent inquiry into the violence, which reportedly left 58 Palestinians dead. The British prime minister said the use of live rounds by Israeli forces was “deeply troubling” and called for greater restraint. Now the UK government faces questions as to whether UK-made weapons were used by the Israelis last month.A review by government found the UK had issued 12 licences for arms it believed were likely to have been used in the 2014 war. In 2010 the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, said Israeli equipment used in an attack on Gaza “almost certainly” contained British-supplied components.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “The shootings we have seen over recent weeks have been an awful reminder of the appalling collective punishment and oppression that has been inflicted on the people of Gaza. By the government’s own admission, UK arms have been used time and again against Palestinians. Yet the arms sales have continued unabated. There must be a full investigation into if any UK arms have been used in the atrocities we have seen over recent months.”The Duke of Cambridge’s five-day trip will begin in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday 24 June, take in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority’s capital city, and end in Jerusalem. Netanyahu has said it will be “a historic visit, the first of its kind”.But Smith said it was taking place against the “backdrop of a massacre”. He added: “If the prince does not speak out against the violence that has been inflicted, then it will be regarded as a major political endorsement. He must not use his visit to whitewash or legitimise these terrible abuses.”Moscogiuri said: “When he’s in Ramallah, we’d like to see Prince William going beyond the usual royal meet-and-greet by spending time talking with some of the Palestinian communities who’ve been affected by Israel’s 51-year occupation. Like everyone in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, people in Ramallah have endured years of discriminatory restrictions on their movement, with roadblocks, militarised checkpoints and off-limits roads which are for the exclusive use of those in the illegal Israeli settlements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a21a7dd9bb8b6312d3bfe770168391870e794c/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f89a12c88d46810d6319b859851fe82","title":"egypt blocks youtube over film denigrating prophet muhammad","story":"Court ruling ends years-long appeals process over film that sparked deadly anti-US riotsEgypt’s top administrative court ordered authorities to block video-sharing website YouTube for a month over a film denigrating Islam’s prophet Muhammad.

US officials said freedom of speech laws prevented them from stopping the production of inflammatory material.A lower court had ordered the video-sharing site be blocked in 2013 after it carried the video, but the case was appealed by Egypt’s National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority and the ruling was stayed.The top administrative court’s ruling is considered final and cannot be appealed.

The atmosphere was “just like an ordinary meeting between friends” and the two held “candid talks”, Moon said. A video released by the South Korean presidential office had the audio replaced with dramatic music, showing the two men embracing, both with wide smiles.The spontaneous offer by Kim to meet, and Moon’s quick acceptance, shows how close the two leaders have become in a short period of time. It capped a whirlwind 24 hours of diplomacy as Moon scrambled to salvage a 12 June summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore after Trump abruptly cancelled the meeting on Thursday.But on Saturday evening in the US as Moon was briefing reporters on his meeting with Kim, Trump suggested the US-North Korea summit could go ahead as originally planned.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said at the White House. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”Kim “once again committed to complete denuclearisation”, Moon said. But he repeatedly refused to answer questions on the specifics of how North Korea would relinquish its nuclear weapons or if they would allow international experts to inspect nuclear facilities. The thorny issue of how exactly the North would give up its nuclear weapons has consistently hung over discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.US officials have demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm before concessions are granted on economic sanctions or a pledge of non-aggression, while Pyongyang prefers a phased negotiations and concessions from the US. Kim expressed “his fixed will on the historic” meeting with Trump, according to the North’s state run Korean Central News Agency. Photos of the Moon-Kim meeting were printed on the front page of the Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Workers’ party newspaper. “It’s strategically smart for Kim to invite Moon for a face to face meeting, it helps portray him in the public eye as a very friendly, diplomacy-oriented statesman,” said Jenny Town, managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “It really offsets the tone Kim’s regime has put forward with statements threatening nuclear war.”But she warned there was still a chasm between Washington and Pyongyang on core issues, saying there was little point in holding a US-North Korea summit that lacked substance.“This is not diplomacy, it’s political theatre,” Town said. “There is no trust between the two right now, so why would Kim trust any US security guarantee on paper? Trust on both sides need to be built over time and no one should expect Trump to fly to Singapore and leave with all of North Korea’s nukes.” “The path to complete denuclearisation and full peace was never going to be an easy one,” Moon said. But he added, “I’m sure we will succeed”.Moon also said he hoped there could be a meeting between North Korea, South Korea and the US to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war, which ended in an armistice rather than a full peace treaty. He praised Kim for announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, as well as the closing of the country’s nuclear test site this week.The two sides would hold “high-level talks” on 1 June as well as military discussions to reduce tensions and efforts to set up reunions between ided families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/134b02a2860ea8c715a3572a5b880eba53391a75/274_182_3624_2175/master/3624.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c50b32659d73fc959013b84511f8e0c","title":"pakistan election date nawaz sharif imran khan","story":"Election to pit ruling PML-N party against that of former cricket star Imran KhanPakistan will hold a general election on 25 July in what could be only the second democratic transfer of power in the nuclear-armed country’s history.The election is expected to pit the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party against former cricket star Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.Khan’s party vowed Sunday to oust the country’s “corrupt” rulers. “The Pakistani nation ... can see the dawn of a new Pakistan, which will not be ruled by the corrupt,” PTI said in a statement posted on Twitter along with a graphic that read “Mafia’s Game Over”.“Stop us if you can,” it said in another tweet.Turmoil continues to rock the country after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was ousted by the supreme court in July 2017 on corruption charges and later barred from politics for life.Sharif was the 15th prime minister in Pakistan’s seven-decade history – roughly half of it under military rule – to be removed before completing a full term. After Sharif was ousted, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi took over the premiership.Pakistan completed its first ever democratic transfer of power after elections in 2013, when PML-N took over from the Pakistan People’s party following a landslide victory.“This is the second consecutive parliament to complete its tenure and we are now looking forward to go to the people to get their verdict on our performance,” the finance minister, Miftah Ismail, said.While PTI is vowing to clean up the country’s rampant corruption, and invest in education and healthcare, PML-N continues to boast of its investment in the country’s rickety infrastructure and courting billions of dollars in Chinese investment.Since he was ousted, Sharif and PML-N have become increasingly vocal in their confrontation with the country’s military establishment and courts, claiming they are victims of a conspiracy. Despite the numerous court rulings against PML-N, the party has won a string of recent byelections. It continues to enjoy significant support in the country’s most populous Punjab province, but will enter the election under increasing pressure.In April, a Pakistan court disqualified the foreign minister, Khawaja Asif, for violating the country’s election laws, while the interior minister, Ahsan Iqbal, was shot in the arm in a suspected assassination attempt in early May by an Islamist gunman. Sharif also sparked a firestorm earlier this month after suggesting Pakistani militants were behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks, approaching what is seen as a red line in the country by touching on criticism of Pakistan’s armed forces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507678.1527192306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish backstop provisions cannot be used for britain says eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May:  “The UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK,”  a senior EU official said. Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3509818.1527336192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reaction the country has listened women have spoken","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBallot boxes are emptied as vote counting takes place after the Irish abortion referendum, at the RDS Conference centre in Dublin on May 26th, 2018. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesIreland has voted to\u0026nbsprepeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution.On Friday night the result became clear when an exit poll carried out for The  by IpsosMRBI indicated a landslide victory for the Yes side. Campaigners on both sides of the debate have been reacting.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “I think what we’ve seen today really is the culmination of a quiet revolution that’s taken place in Ireland for the past 10 or twenty years. This has been a great exercise in democracy and the people have spoken.“The people have said we want a modern constitution for a modern country, that we trust women and we respect them to make the right decision, the right choices about their own healthcare.”Mr Varadkar told RTÉ the results so far show the nation is united, not ided. When asked what he believed the key factors were influencing people’s vote, the Taoiseach said: “Most of all and above all, it was the very many brave women and men who told their personal stories as to how the Eighth Amendment impacted on them, and impacted on them adversely.”Personal stories “allowed us as a nation to understand how this hard law created so many hard cases, and allowed us as a nation to come of age and to make this big change that we’re making in our constitution today.”Tánaiste Simon Coveney has expressed confidence that TDs previously opposed to repealing the Eighth Amendment will not seek to frustrate the passage of legislation.“I think what you will see now is the government moving quickly on the legislation and the opposition will support that too - I think there will be very few people in the Dáil who will try to frustrate what is now the clear will of the vast, vast majority of the Irish people,” he said.“For me, the margin of victory is important but equally important is that there is no Dublin versus the rest or no urbanrural ide -in virtually every part of the country, people have voted in big numbers to allow the government and the Oireachtas to change Ireland for the better.”Retired Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness, who is a veteran of the 1983 campaign opposing the addition of the Eight Amendment to the constitution. On Saturday she said they were very pleased at the time with the 33 per cent No vote. “Given the amount of bitterness at the time, we felt we would get 10 per cent. I remember being very pleased that we made 33 per cent of the vote.“It was a lonely place in 1983. I’ve just come into the count at the RDS where there are young people full of joy,” she said.Ms McGuinness was part of the Together for Yes campaign, participating in Grandparents for Yes and Lawyers for Yes. “Together for Yes worked very well together. They all held together, that’s important.”The campaign this time was “much more civilised” than in 1983 she said. However, she added that she felt the response of audience members who supported a No vote during the Claire Byrne show “might have made people vote the other way.”Minister for Health Simon Harris said this was an extraordinary day for Ireland and for women from across the country.“The Eighth Amendment abandoned women in crisis, the Minister said.“Women have been told take the plane, take the boat. Today we say take our hand. Women have been told you are on your own. Today we say we stand with you.”“People have given us a job to do. It is a big body of work to do. We have been given the go ahead,” he told the Marian Finucane show on RTÉ.Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Dr Rhona Mahony, said the referendum result “is all about the women who travelled in difficult circumstances and told their stories.” It is important that doctors can now care for women in crisis pregnancies in their own country,’ she told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane Show.“It’s a very emotional day. It’s all about real life and the dilemma faced by Irish women every day.”The difference between this referendum and that in 1983 is the level of information available to the public, she said.“This has been a very informed conversation from the get go.”She pointed out that from the Oireachtas Sub Committees, the Citizens’ Assembly, the Expert Group, people had been “really engaged.” Conversations had occurred, not just in public fora, but at family dinner tables, among students in universities, she said. “The country has listened. Women have spoken.”Dr Peter Boylan said this is a watershed moment for Irish women and a message to the 170,000 women who have had to travel outside this jurisdiction.The chair of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said this was a message to this women that they are valued.“This is about the women of Ireland and the couples of Ireland.”He said he was not surprised by the scale of the result.Director of the National Women’s Council and Co-Director of Together for Yes, Orla O’Connor thanked “every woman and man in every town, village and county who came out and voted yes. Because this is phenomenal.”“This was a grassroots, people campaign and I think what today will show is that this is a people’s referendum. Presuming that these exit polls are correct, the public haven’t just spoken, this is a resounding roar from Irish people about the horrors of the Eighth and how women should no longer be treated as second class citizens in our society.”“Today I think there will be an overwhelming feeling of relief, but also a very emotional one in terms of really being listened to and heard by the Irish public.”Colm O’Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland commended the “decades of campaigning and activism” that led to the referendum.“The scale of the indicated win in this is just phenomenal. We’re just incredibly proud and honoured to have been part of this campaign, what I’m struck most by is that this win is the result of decades of campaigning and activism by a very wide range of organisations and activists going on now for a very long time”, he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “But today’s vote is mainly the result of the courage and integrity of women and families who have spoken out about the harm and suffering that they experienced because of the Eighth Amendment.Dublin South West Solidarity TD Paul Murphy said the projected result was a political “earthquake”.“It’s such a rejection, driven by young people and by women, of an Ireland of the past, of domination of the Catholic Church, of oppression of women,” he said.“People are looking for a very different type of society and it should send a clear message. It’s a rejection of dishonest lies, of the conservative right in Ireland which has had so much power for so long that their time is gone.”Ailbhe Smyth, co director of Together for Yes, speaking on Saturday morning said the indications are that Ireland is heading for “absolutely extraordinary” milestone in its history.“For those of us who have been campaigning for a long time and all of the younger people we have been campaigning with over the past several months, we are truly stunned and deeply relieved, deeply pleased and deeply grateful to the people of Ireland,” she told RTÉ.“Because this looks as if we have come to a real milestone. It is an incredibly significant change on a number of different levels, very immediately of course for women who need abortions - it is absolutely extraordinary.”Minster for Children Katherine Zappone said new laws legalising abortion will be passed “as quickly as possible” as much of the groundwork is already completed.“I think the legislation will go as absolutely as quickly as possible as any legislation could - I believe very much we can get this done before the end of the year,” she told RTÉ.Ms Zappone added: “I feel very emotional, I’m especially grateful to the women of Ireland who came forward to provide their personal testimony, about the hard times they endured, about the stress and the trauma they experienced because of the Eighth Amendment. “It is because of them that I feel a deep gratitude today as we hope and wait for the polls to turn into official results.”The Irish Family Planning Association has said it is committed to providing abortion care in Ireland .“Today is a transformative day for women’s health and reproductive rights,” IFPA chief executive Niall Behan said. “The people of Ireland have righted a historic wrong. The Yes vote ends decades of stigma, shame and silence around abortion and unintended pregnancy. It ends the rejection and abandonment of women by the state.”Tara Flynn, Irish actor, writer and Yes campaigner, said in a Twitter thread: “This is our home. Not some fictional 70s postcard hiding misery and shame. This proud, young, progressive, kind country is our home. There’s a lot to fix. But now we know we have the people power to fix it.”Minister for Education Richard Bruton has said the projected scale of the Yes vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment was “impressive,” and early tallies in his constituency appeared to confirm the exit polls.Mr Bruton said based on “the scale of the decision people have made, it’s fairly clear that they favour change.”People did not see the referendum campaign as one led by the Government, he said. “Parties weren’t taking a prominent position, so I think voters made up their own minds which I think is the strength of this decision,” he said.Caroline, who travelled to Liverpool with husband for a termination after FFA diagnosis: “This is a very emotional day for my family, I’m hoping that this will give us further closure for our grief, really hope that young women like myself won’t ever have to go through the same journey that we had.”“I’m glad to say that I’ve just given birth to my little girl since I last spoke to you. Things are really looking up for my family,” she told Morning Ireland.“I knew all my family and friends and any one that I spoke to about my story was going to vote yes, but I was very anxious. I regret that anxiety now, because I really should have trusted the people of Ireland.”“I’m so pleased that everybody in Ireland is very informed, they’re very educated and they really do have hearts of gold.”Independent Alliance members Shane Ross, Finian McGrath and John Halligan have welcomed the early tallies.The three members campaigned for a Yes vote. They said they now believe it is important to get the legislation through without delay.John McGuirk, spokesman for Save the 8th, told The  he had “made peace” with the result, acknowledging it is an overwhelming majority for Yes side.Katie Ascough, of pro-amendment LoveBoth, said the No side have been galvanised by the referendum for continued campaigning. “I think this is only the beginning of a really, really strong grassroots movement with the pro-life campaign and their supporting groups,” she said.Iona Institute spokesman David Quinn has acknowledged that many people who voted Yes were not pro-abortion, but were pro-choice. He told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane show: “Even the expectations of the Yes side were surpassed.”This was a complete reverse of the 1983 result, he said. “I don’t think any one expected it to this extent.”The anti-abortion side was “boiled down to its core” one third of the vote, he added. In 1983 it had been a lonely place to be on the pro-choice side, said Mr Quinn. “It took 35 years to reach this position.“No societal position remains forever. This is the position for the next few decades.”When asked about social media in the campaign, he said that Twitter was not the best way to judge anything. He defended the Iona Institute’s poster campaign saying that they used one simple image.“We didn’t run a ground campaign. We’re about getting profile in the media.”Declan Ganley, entrepreneur and anti-abortion campaigner, siad on Twitter: “When due to the snuffing out of their human rights, the first of countless thousands of Ireland’s unborn children are killed in Irish clinics or hospitals, all those that voted No can at least know you fought the good fight to try to save those little ones. Heros all.”Cora Sherlock, spokeswoman for the Love Both campaign: “This is a very sad day for Ireland, that people have voted for abortion.”“We need to remember what they have won,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.“All that is being offered is abortion. There has been no talking about why Irish woman travel, what options could have been put on the table.”She said that the last time “a proper discussion” on alternative possibilities to abortion had taken place had been 20 years ago.Ms Sherlock paid tribute to Pro Life campaigners: “We will regroup, we will re-organise to ensure the safety of mothers and babies in Ireland.”Maeve O’Hanlon of the Love Both campaign said Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar had promised there would be restrictive abortion if people voted Yes in the referendum and he should now honour that commitment in whatever legislation is brought before the Dáil.“We have had very little discussion in this entire debate about the 97 per cent of abortion that take place for socio-economic reasons and very little discussions on why women have abortion and what we can do to bring those numbers down,” said Ms O’Hanlon.“We have heard nothing in recent months but about these rare tragic cases that we all have compassion for . . . for me whatever happens today it’s been a missed opportunity to address the underlying reasons why women have abortions.”Anne Rabbitte, Fianna Fail’s Children and Youth Affairs spokeswoman, who advocated retaining the Eighth Amendment, said “democracy has ruled” and the Oireachtas should now support the will of the people by legislating for abortion. “I think this tells us we are no longer a conservative society,” she said.“I think we might be traditional but we are not conservative, and I also think the fact that there was such a fantastic turnout yesterday gives an overwhelming, resounding support.”Independent TD Michael Healy Rae commented: “I voted no because of firmly held beliefs. The people voted the way they did, now it is over to the legislators. We will have to look at what the Minister will do in the Dáil. The people have spoken.”Independent TD and “no” campaigner Mattie McGrath has admitted he is “a bit surprised” by the projected outcome of the referendum and called for “compassion” for women in crisis pregnancies when it comes to drawing up the legislation.“The people have spoken and we have to listen to that,” the Tipperary TD said. “We have to see the legislation when it’s published and examine it. I’m certainly not going to obstruct it. We’ll have a constructive debate, hopefully, and a respectable debate. In Tipperary, up to 40 per cent of the people will have voted differently and they must be accounted for in the legislation as well.”Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508377.1527276417!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"get your voice heard on brexit talks corbyn urges ni politicians","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, poses for a selfie with Prof Deirdre Heenan during a visit to Lifford Bridge on the Border.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireNorthern Ireland needs a voice at the Brexit talks table in London, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he urged Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party to reach a deal on restoring Stormont. “Please, to the parties in Stormont: you have to come together to re-form a government there. I hope they understand that message and I hope that we can make very rapid progress on that,” Mr Corbyn declared in Derry.“It is impossible to go through a period so crucial as Brexit negotiations without a voice for Northern Ireland being made at the table by the political classes in NI,” he told Derry Chamber of Commerce.The local economy in Derry “depends absolutely” on the ability of local businesses to travel freely across the Border with the Republic, said the Labour leader, on the second day of a visit to NI.“The idea of a hard Border is impossible to conceive that it would do anything other than seriously damage this area and damage the life-chances of people in this area in a place which has already suffered.“Any kind of border, physical border, virtual reality border, technological border, whatever, would be very damaging to the economy,” he said, sharply criticising the performance of Conservative prime minister, Theresa May. Emphasising that he wanted to see a Brexit deal that protects jobs across the United Kingdom, Mr Corbyn yet again favoured a customs deal with the European Union and continued tariff-free access after it leaves.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee welcomed Mr Corbyn’s commitment to avoid a hard border.She repeated the Government’s call for the British government to agree to a “legally operable text” around the backstop option post-Brexit that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European Union’s customs union and single market in the event of no alternative proposal to maintain an invisible border.“Our preferred option continues to be the closest possible relationship and any proposals to that effect are welcome but the backstop must be dealt with separately it would ensure no border or related customs checks or controls in the absence of a close relationship,” she told The .“Irrespective of Mr Corbyn’s comments the British government must still come forward with the proposals on the backstop and we need to see sufficient progress on this by the June European Council. I remain optimistic that this can happen.”During his time in Derry and Belfast, Mr Corbyn heard mounting concerns about the post-Brexit existence of the Border and, indeed, concerns about the wider Brexit exit deal.Under a “backstop” deal reached last December, Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations necessary to ensure that no hard Border is needed, though this deal is increasingly being questioned now by leading British Cabinet members.“Crucial decisions are going to be made in the next three months, and I understand very clearly the message that you have given me here this morning,” he told his audience.Meanwhile, the Labour leader said the situation where unelected civil servants have had to take major policy decisions because of the lack of the NI Executive and Assembly cannot continue.“It is unconscionable that you have civil servants making major decisions, then challenged by the courts, with elected politicians having no say whatsoever,” he declared.Welcoming the Labour leader, the president of Derry’s Chamber of Commerce, Jennifer McKeever, said Derry is “the city at the heart of the Brexit conundrum”.Delivering a strong message that 90 per cent of local businesses want to stay in the European Union’s customs union and single market, she said they serve two counties, two countries, two jurisdictions.“Every day, thousands of us cross the Border for work, for education, for health and for trade. The EU is not a foreign, far-away bureaucracy – it’s a couple of miles from where we sit. “It’s where many of our staff live and where we find our customers and trading partners. Everybody accepts that it would be unacceptable to reintroduce a hard Border in Ireland.”However, she warned that it is “infinitely more difficult to understand” the declarations from London politicians that the UK “can pull out of the customs union and single market” and avoid a hard Border.“The truth is we just cannot see how you can square this circle: to both leave the EU and to ensure no Border – to create the unique solution for NI Ireland and to do it without damaging our peace and prosperity.”Speaking directly to Mr Corbyn, she said the customs union and single market offer a market of 500 million people: “It’s under those conditions that we have built the business community that you are sitting with this morning.”Warning that local patience is “wearing thin”, she insisted that the British government’s favoured options of a customs partnership, or a technological deal to solve Border issues do not “inspire confidence”.Urging more British politicians to visit Northern Ireland, Bonnie Anley, the chair of Foyle Port, said it is “vital” that they “experience and see” the day-to-day realities that are now facing local firms.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Guitar maker Fender and four Japanese musical instrument manufacturers raided in price-fix probeFlorence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Comment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herTwo die after collapsing at Mutiny Festival in Portsmouth\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 lights up skies over LondonKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inSchools to let students study technical qualifications instead of A-levelsComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideGovernment quietly planning for Britain to stay in EU after March deadline, Eurosceptics fearComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Florence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Guitar maker Fender and four Japanese musical instrument manufacturers raided in price-fix probeComment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herTwo die after collapsing at Mutiny Festival in Portsmouth\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 lights up skies over LondonKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inSchools to let students study technical qualifications instead of A-levelsComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideGovernment quietly planning for Britain to stay in EU after March deadline, Eurosceptics fearComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

Whilst A levels provide a world class academic qualification, many technical education courses are undervalued by employers and don’t always provide students with the skills they need to secure a good job - that has to change, he said. Naming the first 52 colleges and providers where young people will be able to study the first T levels is an important step forward, and we will continue the work with business and the education sector so everyone can benefit from these vital reforms.The locations are spread across the country and include further education colleges, schools, community colleges and training centres. The West Midlands is the region with the highest number of centres, with ten providers including University College Birmingham, City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College and Bordesley Green Girls’ School \u0026amp Sixth Form signed up to the scheme. In Yorkshire and the Humber schools including Barnsley College, York College and Notre Dame Catholic Sixth Form College are set to provide the qualification.Six schools and colleges in London are signed up, as well as four in the north east of England, five in the north west and nine in the south east. The east of the country has the fewest providers, with just one centre, Derby College in the East Midlands, and three in the East of England. The courses will include three month industry placements and a curriculum designed by employers.Earlier this week the Institute for Apprenticeships announced the draft content for the first three qualifications, and asked for feedback from further education providers by June 4. Which A-levels to take for the most popular degreesThe construction course will focus on design, surveying and planning, with modules covering topics including health and safety law, environmental performance, the internet of things and team management. The digital course will cover production, design and development, including topics such as internet security, data management, and the ethical issues raised by an increasing reliance on technology. On the education and childcare course students will learn about child development, ersity legislation, child language acquisition, and how to work with parents.  The courses were initially supposed to be launched by 2019 but last summer skills minister Anne Milton announced that the timetable had been delayed by a year.Commenting on the announcement, the Prime Minister said: Everyone should be able to have access to an education that suits them, but we know that for those that don’t choose to go to university, the routes into further technical and vocational training can be hard to navigate.  That’s why we’re making the most significant reform to advanced technical education in 70 years to ensure young people have gold standard qualifications open to them whichever route they choose. T-levels provide a high-quality, technical alternative to A-levels ensuring thousands of people across the country have the skills we need to compete globally – a vital part of our modern industrial strategy.Department for EducationGuitar maker Fender and four Japanese musical instrument manufacturers raided in price-fix probeFlorence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Comment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herTwo die after collapsing at Mutiny Festival in Portsmouth\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 lights up skies over LondonKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideGovernment quietly planning for Britain to stay in EU after March deadline, Eurosceptics fearComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

Perhaps he thought my marriage was on the rocks and I needed somewhere to go. Or did he think I’d been up to some sort of financial no good, and required a safe haven?Neither, touch wood, is true. It turned out he was referring to the prospect of a Labour government. “Mine’s in Switzerland. I‘ve got an apartment there, I’ve worked it all out, I can live and work there, I can come and go, still see the family, and not have to pay higher taxes.”Others, he said, were doing the same. He seemed surprised that I hadn’t planned my own escape route.We did not get into the detail, about how he was going to structure his tax affairs, but I didn’t doubt him. Indeed, subsequent conversations revealed that he was correct: plenty of City folk are readying to decamp, rather than face the prospect of increased income tax and other punitive measures coming their way.Which is why the shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s current drive to woo the City will prove so fruitless.In his speech at Bloomberg’s headquarters, to launch his campaign, McDonnell proposed, a “new start in the relationship between Labour and the finance sector”. Financial services, he claimed, will have a “seat at the policy-making and policy delivery table” under a future Labour government.He insisted the City has a role to play in the “transformative programme” he will seek to introduce if his party wins the next general election.Quite what McDonnell had in mind for that transformative programme was outlined in a subsequent TV interview: “At the end of the day, I want a socialist society. And that means transforming in a way which radically challenges the system as it now is. And I think that’s what we’re doing. And what’s interesting, we’re taking people with us, because people see that there has to be that transformation.” Added McDonnell: “We cannot allow another crisis to occur that occurred in 2007 where we all have to pay for that.”Apparently, if he is true to his word, McDonnell wants City representatives to be “at the policy-making and policy-delivery table” when Labour’s plans are hardened and approved. Try as I might I cannot imagine who they will be, and, more to the point, how they will make themselves heard.Smith’s “prawn cocktail offensive” actually made some headway. The City respected Smith (liked would be putting it too strong). He was viewed as a moderate, sensible. He was also shadow chancellor during a period of economic recession, when the Tories were not highly regarded by the business community.Then came Tony Blair’s push. He drew appreciative nods with his early, ground-breaking moves, like scrapping clause 4 of the Labour constitution, so removing the lingering doubt that privatised utilities might be renationalised, and making the setting of interest rates independently of government and political influence.Blair and his colleagues also spoke the right language. Peter Mandelson’s declaration of being “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes” might have caused eyebrows to shoot skywards in some party circles, as being too much, even for capitalism-embracing New Labour, but it was well received in the City.Now we have McDonnell and his so-called “cup of tea offensive”, seeking friendly chats with business leaders to try to win them round to Labour’s way of thinking, claiming he wants them in the room, around the table, rather than outside.But, compared with his predecessors, McDonnell really is wasting his time. The City is not stupid. It can see what this shadow chancellor is about. That he despises capitalism that he, along with his boss, Jeremy Corbyn, aspires to see the recreation of a socialist, Venezuelan-type model in the UK, even though Venezuela’s economy has come close to total collapse.The City is acutely aware, too, McDonnell and Corbyn have come a long way precisely on the back of attacking the financial services industry, and all it stands for. Suddenly, they’re making overtures – after a fashion. Why?Because, as they say they want to change the system, and if they’re going to get their initiatives through – such as workers being encouraged to buy their own companies – it will be much easier with City support than without. Because the City represents a rare international success, a huge magnet for overseas investment, and a major plank in our economy. And because they need its capital-raising expertise, and its cash. As McDonnell says: “I don’t expect some people to be overjoyed at having to pay a bit more in income tax or corporation tax or at the introduction of a financial transaction tax.”Not overjoyed is one way of putting it. As my pal indicated, the City long ago made up its mind about McDonnell, well before he began his cup of tea offensive. Never have so many tea leaves been picked in vain.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and executive director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firm.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is what I want you to knowThis risk, and the cost to the NHS, increases with every point of BMI and could result in a major economic toll as well as the health cost if governments fail to get to grips with it, the researchers from the UK and Ireland said.While Scotland currently has fractionally higher rates of morbid obesity, 4 per cent in 2015 compared with 3 per cent in England and Wales, this is due to reverse.Under current trends it is predicted that 11 per cent of the population in Wales will be morbidly obese in 2035, roughly 340,000 adults, while Scotland is likely to plateau at about 5 per cent and England will rise to about 8 per cent.“Wales have a greater portion of the population deprived per capita than England, this may be a potential reason,” Laura Webber, an honorary assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a director of public health modelling at the UK Health Forum, told The Independent.“In terms of morbid obesity specifically, Wales only have one obesity clinic, which could also impact.”Morbidly obese people should be given free flu jabs, says healthKhan to ban junk food advertising on London transportIn England, where close to 4.4 million adults will be affected, 16 per cent of men between the age of 55 and 64 are predicted to be morbidly obese – the highest prevalence of any group.“The morbidly obese group are particularly vulnerable to diseases, which is of course very costly to the NHS,” Ms Webber added.Morbid obesity is already a huge burden on the economy and health services, accounting for around a third of all obesity-related costs.While overweight and obesity trends for Great Britain have been projected to 2035, until now there have been no trend estimates for morbid obesity.BMI is a widely accepted measure of obesity, calculated as a person’s weight ided by their height squared, to be morbidly obese it must exceed 40kgm2. Other metrics look at whether a person is suffering obesity related diseases before age 35.The latest findings on morbid obesity are being presented at the European Obesity Congress in Vienna on Saturday.Webber and her co-author, Laura Keaver from the Sligo Institute of Technology in the Republic of Ireland, said measures to reverse these trends and the underlying social causes “must be an important public health priority”.Health news in picturesHealth news in picturesResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping activeA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.\u0026#13Research from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.The family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13Growth in obesity is predicted from annual health reports from each country – there was insufficient data for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – coupled with employment and education data – socioeconomic factors that have been shown to be important predictors of BMI.In Scotland, the significantly slower rate of growth can be attributed to work carried out by the Scottish government in addressing inequality, the researchers said.“The government put a massive push on developing a route map for how we can actually combat this,” said Ms Keaver.“They put together resources from the NHS that were proving to be effective. They did put a lot of work into it.”Meanwhile in England a tax on sugary drinks has helped many producers reformulate their products, but a voluntary levy on sugary foods has not resulted in manufacturers making significant reductions.For Wales, where the inequality between people in managerial-level jobs and routine or manual professions is expected to become more significant, the pair say health interventions should be targeted at these groups.A spokesperson for Public Health Wales told The Independent: “Health trends and future predictions are complex, and predictions should not be taken as facts – they provide us with a picture of where past trends may take us if nothing changes, and give us great motivation to try and change those trends for a better future.While tackling obesity, especially in early years, is a priority and a new obesity strategy is under development – to be published in the autumn – they added “we have a significant challenge to overcome”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.As its structure is so different, the i-motif can be used as a switch when paired with regular DNA – with the two different shapes being recognised as either “on” or “off”.This has already been applied in basic nanomachine applications, and work by Dr Waller and her colleagues has expanded the repertoire of switches that can be used in such settings.By adding copper salts to DNA in oxygen-free conditions, they found DNA could be changed into an i-motif shape. This could then be further modified into another shape called a “hairpin” by adding oxygen to the mix.These results were published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research.“One of the direct applications is in DNA-based computing,” explained Dr Waller.Decoding rose DNA could allow scientists to create better flowersThe concept of DNA computing has floated around for years, with Microsoft investigating potential applications and using DNA for data storage.Some scientists have used the code of DNA to store information, or constructed simple logic gates and circuits.“You can use DNA to make logic gates and one of the advantages in using DNA is computing is that you can carry out calculations in parallel if your different types of logic gates are represented by different triggers or ingredients,” said Dr Waller.“So the fact we have discovered separate triggers for the same type of DNA means you could increase the output you could actually use.”Other technological applications of DNA include the creation of tiny “nanobots” that can deliver drugs to parts of the body.“DNA is biocompatible, so if you make a nanomachine out of DNA you can introduce it to a cell and it doesn’t get destroyed or recognised as quickly as some other agents we introduce,” said Dr Waller.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The screens act as a deterrent to customers by making them more aware they are being watched.Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties watchdog Big Brother Watch, said: “Sainsbury’s new self-surveillance screens are a gross intrusion of shoppers’ privacy, broadcasting the contents of our wallets and baskets. “These new cameras are a blatant attempt to intimidate customers and make us feel more closely watched than ever.“It is absolutely disgusting for Sainsbury’s to treat its loyal customers like criminals, especially as it is now nigh on impossible to get a human checkout. Big Brother Watch calls on Sainsbury’s to remove these surveillance screens urgently.”Sainsbury’s said it had installed the cameras at more than 300 stores, but refused to say if they would be rolled out to its remaining 1,100 outlets or whether the monitors were proving an effective deterrent.The supermarket said footage from its self-facing cameras, some of which were installed last year, were kept for 31 days before being overridden. According to a recent study, £3.2bn worth of goods is stolen from UK self-service tills every year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice.

They have much to lose.Theresa May is demanding back the £1billion we put into this system.But that is chicken feed next to our £39billion divorce bill.She must insist not a penny is paid until we are reinstated in Galileo and a trade deal is signed.We were naive to imagine Brussels would be a friendly partner after Brexit.Its powerful bureaucrats are now nakedly and dangerously hostile.WOULD you pay £2,000 extra tax a year to keep the NHS afloat?

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a giant, decisive leap towards the destruction of Brexit and 17million referendum votes.It would be a mortal blow to the Prime Minister. How could she survive it?Tory rebels must realise this. But even wrecking their PM, Government and party, jeopardising national stability and potentially handing power to Corbyn’s Marxist lunatics fails to deter them.Mrs May must leave them in no doubt about the monstrous risk they are taking.Then, for the first time, she must turn that aggression on Brussels.The Sun is heartily sick of the EU’s destructive belligerence and playground bullying, sick of it “teaching Britain a lesson”, sick of our timid, cowed Government cravenly turning the other cheek.We’ve had two years of it.

Like it denies poisoning the Skripals, backing Assad’s chemical weapons massacres and meddling in other countries’ ­elections. But the world must act.Many countries have sent Putin’s spies home.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its head vet, Claire Miller, said: “It’s widely known that animals do wonders for our emotional and physical health, so it’s great to see that as a nation we really do believe that they are great for our overall happiness.“While pets can help to boost our mood, we of course also need to ensure that they are happy too.“A diet that’s high in nutritional value and is balanced, combined with plenty of exercise, will ensure that they thrive.“Look out for a wagging tail in response to human contact from your pooch or a kitty settling on your lap.“These are clear indications that you make your pet as happy as they make you.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

We’ve teamed up with the cycling experts at Halfords to select four great suggestions of cycle routes to visit. And we’ve listed some all-important things you may want to consider to ensure you’re completely prepared. \u2028Remember, a bike ride can be five minutes or five hours – the main thing is getting out in the fresh air with your loved ones. How to check your bikes are ready  If you’re heading off on a family trip then it’s important to make sure that everyone’s bike is in good condition. A few simple checks before you set out could save you a lot of worry later on. Make sure your bike’s tyres are inflated to the correct pressure (there’s a helpful guide here ), and remember that on mountain bikes there are different tyre pressures for on-road and off-road. If you have questions, then it\u0027s also worth checking Halfords’ massive selection of cycling help and advice online. Ideally, you’ll check the tyres around a week before you go, and re-check before you leave to see if they have lost any pressure during that time. If they do, you may have a puncture that you can repair. Alternatively, Halfords will do any bike maintenance you need in-store and has service and repair plans that offer yearly checks.  You should also make sure that your chain is rust-free, as well as checking that all your gears work and the levers operate them smoothly. Often a simple adjustment is all that’s needed, but if you don’t feel confident then Halfords has a FREE bike check to make sure you’re in good shape, and offers a range of services to ensure that your bike is in tip-top condition. Halfords experts will conduct checks on your gears, brakes, tyres and frame to make sure you’re good to go. Not only will you be taking advantage of their expert knowledge, you’ll also be freeing up more time to spend enjoying yourself. Get the right rack  If you\u0027re planning to drive somewhere with your family\u0027s bikes then you need to choose a rack for your car that suits your needs. The Thule 591 Bike Carrier allows you to mount one bike on the roof of your car, keeping it nice and safe en route to your cycling break. You can actually fit up to four to your car – so it’s a good thing that right now when you buy one, you can get another half price, with free fitting. Alternatively, consider a rear-mounted rack, like the Thule 9403 Bike Carrier , which holds up to three cycles. Right now there’s 20 per cent off a range of bike racks at Halfords, and its experts will fit them for you, meaning you can focus on your next trip. So, where to cycle?\u2028\u2028 Richmond Park, London  The Tamsin Trail in Richmond Park has quiet and car-free tracks that offer a cycle of a little more than seven miles. You can get there by train – although check the bike capacity with the relevant operator – or by car. Because the trails don\u0027t feature a lot of motor traffic it\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re just starting out or have kids.  It\u0027s only just outside London – you can see St Paul\u0027s through a gap in the trees at King Henry\u0027s Mound – but it feels like the proper countryside. Some with smaller children might be feeling a bit left out here, but don’t worry because Halfords has the Hamax Kiss Rear Child Bike Seat at half price in time for the bank holiday weekend.  Little kids adore being taken around on the back of your bike, and it will give you beefier leg muscles too! If you\u0027ve got a couple of smaller children then you might also want to consider the Halfords Double Buggy trailer, which is a two-seater trailer for your little ones (older than 12 months) that allows you to get out and about, and give them a load of fun at the same time. Ae Valley, Scotland  Located near Dumfries, the Ae Valley Route is classified as Green by the Scottish Forestry Commission, which makes it suitable for families (there are more challenging routes nearby too). It\u0027s about 5.6 miles with stunning views and exciting, single track forest roads. As it\u0027s well-suited to families, consider one of Halfords’ amazing kids bikes. The Apollo Gridlok is ideal for 8-11 year-olds and is currently has 20 per cent off. So too is the Carrera Star bike, aimed at smaller children aged 4-6. (Discount applies to 14” Carrera Star only.)  Remember, you can always pop in to store with you little ones to have them try out bikes, and Halfords experts are on-hand to help you pick the right model. They’ll check the bike is the right size and even build it for you, free of charge. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire  A 14 mile marked circuit means that this won\u0027t suit very young cyclists, but may well appeal to families with a bit more experience. Of course you don\u0027t have to ride the whole route and circuit isn\u0027t too challenging even for families. The route is signposted too, just start at the Cannop Cycle Centre.  An ideal route for families who have developed a love of cycling together, perhaps with older kids. Consider the Carrera Kraken mountain bike for this trip, especially if your existing bike is looking a little sorry for itself. If you pop in store now you\u0027ll also find this brilliant bike is now only \u0026pound360, (down from \u0026pound450, thanks to Halfords’ 20 per cent offer on a range of bikes). Stanhope \u0026amp Tyne Railway Railway path, Sunderland  This route is easy to break into much smaller sections, and is made up of paths that follow the old railway route closed in 1985. There is no traffic to worry about, the surfaces are largely good quality gravel or tarmac and of course it\u0027s easy to access from Sunderland\u0027s public transport. This route is ideally suited for those who want to break up a cycling tour over a few days. The flat, mostly smooth paths mean that if you\u0027re not a mountain biker then you\u0027ll be fine.  And for those looking for a new bike, the Pendleton Somerby hybrid bike offers both style and practicality in spades.

NHS data shows overweight and medically obese kids under five needed 473 hospital appointments last year. That is more than double the number treated a decade ago and a rise of nearly 20 per cent in a year. Almost a quarter of children are now overweight or obese when they start primary school. This figure rises to 34 per cent by the time they leave for senior school.  Britain’s childhood obesity crisis is now so grave that in some regions more than half the kids are overweight by the age of 11. It is believed many youngsters are eating up to 500 calories more than the recommended daily amount – the equivalent of an extra meal.

The MV Oliver Cromwell , a steamer and riverboat hotel, sank around 12 miles off the coast during a journey to Ireland, sparking panicked calls to emergency crews.   The local Holyhead Coastguard were called at around 2pm to reports of the incident, but they could not do anything to prevent the boat sinking around three hours later, the Daily Post reports .  The boat, which was built in 1922 and converted into a riverboat hotel in 1993, was heading to Coleraine on Wednesday after being sold to a new owner.  Nobody was injured and the coastguard said the sinking did not cause any pollution. The RNLI were also called out to assist with the operation. An RNLI spokesman said: “The call from UK Coastguard at 2.20pm cited a paddle steamer on tow towards Ireland taking on water approximately 10 miles west of South Stack. “Holyhead ’s Severn class all-weather lifeboat Christopher Pearce launched immediately and headed to the scene, arriving there within 40 minutes.  “On arriving at the scene, it was evident the 36-metre vessel was in trouble and beginning to sink from the bow. “She was being towed by tug towards Ireland after a period in the south of England.” The crew found that the paddle steamer did not have anyone on board, and did not contain any fuel. The spokesman added: “A very quick decision was made by the coxswain that the situation was too dangerous to try and put any crew on board the stricken vessel. “Within half an hour, the vessel had sunk further into the sea, and at 4.20pm she sank completely into the 50-metre deep waters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"its new type shoplifter shoppers","story":"News\u0027It\u0027s a new type of shoplifter\u0027: Shoppers are \u0027using carrots to steal expensive avocados\u0027 at self-service tillsThe deceptive technique reportedly started out in Australia before spreading across to Britain\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel Bishop13:28, 26 MAY 2018Updated14:58, 26 MAY 2018NewsMore than £3 billion of goods are estimated to be stolen through Britain\u0027s 50,000 self-service tills each year (file picture) (Image: )\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0027new type of shoplifter\u0027 has emerged - people tricking supermarket swipe tills into buying more expensive items with cheaper ones.  Shoppers have reportedly been avoiding the avocado\u0027s relatively high price tag by passing them off as carrots at self-service tills. Carrots are one of the cheapest vegetables by weight, which has led to suspicions that supermarket customers are abusing electronic checkouts in a shoplifting scam. Emmeline Taylor, a senior lecturer in criminology at City, University of London, said people switch labels or deliberately input the wrong item to pay less for produce.  She told The Times newspaper that she first spotted the trend in Australia and it is also happening in Britain. I was working with retailers to reduce shoplifting when one major supermarket discovered it had sold more carrots than it had ever had in stock, she said. Puzzled by this development it looked into its inventories and found that in some cases customers were apparently purchasing 18kg of carrots in one go. Unfortunately this wasn\u0027t a sudden switch to healthy eating, it was an early sign of a new type of shoplifter.

Steven Russell, 42, was distracted by his mobile phone when he ploughed straight into 57-year-old Robert Morris just days before Christmas. Mr Morris was on his way to meet his brother as he crossed Antsy road in Coventry, West Midlands, at around 11.20pm on December 17, 2016. Russell had been in constant text contact on his journey, messaging two women backwards and forwards, a court heard. A prosecutor told how Russell did nothing to avoid the collision, saying he hadn’t braked, he hadn’t swerved, he simply drove straight into Robert Morris.  The Jaguar hit him in the nearside lane, throwing him into the air. Mr Morris landed in the road behind the car and Russell stopped and called 999.  The victim was rushed by ambulance to University Hospital suffering from “multiple and severe injuries.”  Sadly, he died from his injuries three days later, on December 20. At an earlier hearing, a jury took seven hours to find former HGV driver Russell guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. He also pleaded guilty to harassing his daughter’s partner by threatening him with phone calls, texts and turning up at his home.  Russell, of Coventry, appeared at Warwick Crown Court yesterday, where he was jailed for seven years.   He was also banned from driving for eight years. Sentencing him, Judge Andrew Lockhart QC called the collision \u0027utterly avoidable\u0027. He said: This offence began when you left home that night and you were in constant text contact with two women. You were distracted throughout this whole journey, you were texting backwards and forwards throughout. I utterly reject your evidence that the texts were only received or sent at traffic lights. You were driving along using your telephone as if you were sitting at home. You are a man with a proven propensity to drive while distracted. You were only dismissed a few days before this offence. It should have been at the very forefront of your mind that mobile phones and transport do not mix.

All the ex-Commandos are understood to have been veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan war zones who were \u0026shysuffering with their mental health. The spate of deaths – described as “carnage” – came as it also emerged that a further three former soldiers are feared to have taken their own lives since the beginning of April. It is understood to have caused “grave concern” at the very highest levels of the tight-knit Marines, whose proud traditions date back 350 years.  Maj Gen Charles Stickland, who as Commandant General is head of the elite corps, is said to have expressed deep concern over the deaths. And Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan with the Army but now holds the ceremonial post of the Marines’ Captain General, has also voiced his worries. Harry recently said that both he and new bride Meghan were “shocked to the core” by stories from veterans struggling with mental health issues. He said previously: “I have seen those I have served with suffer, struggling to seek out help they desperately need.  “And we know there are more just like them who suffer in silence.” A veteran of 20 years in the Marines who was friends with one suicide victim \u0026shydescribed the recent surge in deaths as \u0026shy“utter carnage”. He said: “PTSD is a killer. It doesn’t matter who you are, how tough you are or how many medals you have on your chest. Everyone who has served in a combat zone is vulnerable and not \u0026shyeveryone will win the battle with PTSD. “One guy who died was over 6ft and looked as though he could carry the world on his shoulders. “He was a fantastic Marine but not even his best mates knew he had PTSD. “He had a loving family, a nice home and a good job. Yet he wanted to end it all.  “There is a big problem with senior non-commissioned officers, often very strong \u0026shycharacters. They look invincible but they are carrying a lot of \u0026shybaggage and are often too proud to get help.” The disclosure comes after new figures from the Ministry of Defence reveal more than 5,000 Armed Services members were diagnosed with a mental health problem last year. The MoD also revealed that 24 soldiers who joined the military under the age of 18 were medically discharged with mental health problems in 2016-17. One of the Marines who died was buried on the same day that veteran Daniel Johnston, 35, who served in the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment and the special forces, committed suicide. His body was found in woodland in West Sussex after a four-day search involving hundreds of serving and former soldiers.

The animated speech included themes of love, slavery, Martin Luther King, the Song of Solomon, the Industrial Revolution, poverty, war and, even more love.  Yet, despite the speech being a roaring success with most, it evoked a few giggles among certain members of the Royal Family at the royal wedding last Saturday.  The Duchess of Cornwall was seen sniggering during the 14 minute speech and Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice smirked throughout.   Kate Middleton appeared to give the Duchess of Cornwall a side-eye in what many have speculated was a signal for her to be more respectful.  Zara Tindall, daughter of Princess Anne, also had a very interesting expression after the reverend told the congregation that he would try to wrap up so Meghan and Harry can officially get married. But the Reverend Curry bats off any negativity around it, saying: They were listening in their own way. Emotions should be expanded, he added.  Laugh at me, laugh with me, it is all fine by me. Any way I can steer the message about the love of God, I am glad to do that. During his sermon he started by quoting civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King and powered on citing spirituals, medieval poetry and the experiences of slaves in the American south.  We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan and their wedding guests.  By the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as my brother, my sister, and telling them God love you, God bless you Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.  The sermon at Windsor Castle has made the Chicago-born reverend a minor celebrity across the world - prompting some to claim he used the wedding as an attempt to gain world fame - something he flat-out denies. So humble is the upbeat preacher, that he revealed he was convinced someone was pulling an April Fools joke on him when he was first asked to be a part of the big day.  Speaking on today\u0027s Good Morning Britain previously he said: I thought someone was doing an April Fool on me.   Curry, the first black head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, went on to say that he had no idea his speech would be such a hit. He said: I have to admit I had no idea, I really didn\u0027t. I remember thinking to myself, \u0027I hope that\u0027s okay\u0027.

That is despite the best efforts of 007 sex god Daniel Craig, who made movie history when he rose out of the sea in Casino Royale wearing nothing but the skimpiest of ultra-tight trunks.  The problem might be that other famous faces, including aging nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow, 77, have also posed in the unforgiving swimwear that leaves very little to the imagination. It was designed in the 1960s to reduce drag, give support and provide freedom of movement for competitive swimmers. But Speedo admits its trunks are no longer the most popular swimwear for UK men, as many prefer looser fitting shorts. Only 13 per cent of the 3,277 people polled by YouGov actually admitted to liking budgie smugglers. Matthew Smith, of YouGov, said: “Our results show that some things really are better left to the imagination.  “No matter how ready men’s beach bodies are this summer, they might not make too many friends if they stride across the sand in a pair of Speedos.” Second most hated item of clothing in the poll was leather trousers – a favourite of rocker Rod Stewart – with 63 per cent of the votes. Crocs, the brightly coloured rubber shoes, came third with 59 per cent of the votes. Flares, as modelled by Loose Woman Melanie Brown, were fourth with 57 per cent. Clothes with elbow patches – as worn by Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean – were fifth in the poll with 54 per cent of votes. Tracksuits, a fashion staple of Socceraid supporter James Corden, came sixth with 52 per cent of votes.

Dr Anthony Miller, an advisor to the World Health Organisation, says pupils could suffer long-term effects from exposure to the radio waves. He warned: “Radiation from mobile phones and other wireless devices can cause changes in DNA and induce cancer in experimental animals. “Children’s skulls are thinner and absorb much more of this radiation. We ignore this at our future peril.” Campaigners claim an increasing number of people suffer from “electromagnetic sensitivity” – leading to symptoms from a lack of concentration to headaches and nosebleeds. In one disturbing case, a 15-year-old is said to have taken her own life after being overwhelmed by tiredness, dizzy spells and even itchy skin due to wifi networks at her school.  We also found children removed from class by their parents after they began to suffer nausea and concentration issues – and even a teacher who claims he was affected himself. Yet Public Health England insists wifi is safe as it uses similar frequencies to radio and TV and gives less exposure than mobiles. And that means NHS doctors currently have no diagnosis for the condition – leaving those fearing they suffer from it with nowhere to turn. Mum Debra Fry told how her daughter Jenny killed herself after developing the wifi “allergy”. The 15-year-old hanged herself from a tree following two years of crippling tiredness, headaches and even bladder problems. Debra, 57, said: “I believe she just couldn’t take any more. She had overwhelming fatigue, headaches and ear pressure, difficulty finding words, itchy skin, dizziness and stiff joints. “She was getting into trouble at school because she couldn’t concentrate and needed to urinate more than usual, so was always leaving class.  “She’d always been a very good student and a very healthy child. “I made sure she got the right nutrients, the right influences, the right education. I had no idea we were exposing her to something so dangerous.” While many of Jenny’s symptoms could be put down to teenage hormones, Debra and partner Charles Newman are in no doubt they were caused by the wireless networking technology. They say Jenny’s difficulties began when they and her school installed wifi at around the same time in late 2012. But she improved when they took out their home wifi router months later. Debra, of Chadlington, Oxon, said: “All her symptoms eased or went away when she came home, particularly at weekends and holidays. “We wanted to take her to the GP but thought our fears would be dismissed.” She told how Jenny then failed to show up at school one day in June 2015. She said: “She’d texted a friend, hinting at what she was going to do. But they’d left their phone at home. “When they realised something was wrong another friend came to tell me and we went out looking for her.”  Close to tears, Debra told how she saw her daughter in the distance, beside a tree. She said: “I thought she was standing on the bough of the hill. “I was calling out her name, asking if she was okay and reassuring her. “It was only as I got closer I realised she wasn’t standing at all and there was a noose around her neck.” Surveys have shown up to five per cent of people believe they are affected by sensitivity to radio waves. Experts are divided over whether the technology can actually cause harm. And even insurance firms play safe, with some refusing outright to cover schools against claims for exposure. Lloyds of London syndicate CFC Underwriting excludes school liability for injuries “resulting from or contributed to by electromagnetic fields, electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetism, radio waves or noise.” Another firm, Zurich, will offer cover. But Tilden Watson, head of education products, said: “As with any insurance, we would consider the school’s specific involvement in use and supply of the technology.” The International Agency for Research on Cancer – a branch of the World Health Organization – classes wifi as a Group 2B cancer risk, meaning there is not yet enough evidence to dismiss a possible link.  Wifi is included because it uses similar technology to mobile phones. Public Health England says a year spent near to a wifi hotspot would give the same dose of radio waves as a 20-minute mobile call. Canadian Dr Miller believes WHO should increase the risk rating. He said: “We know that when humans are exposed to cancer-causing agents, it’s usually quite a delay before you see the full effect. We’re concerned when those children become adults their risk of cancer will be much greater. “We could be storing up higher cancer rates in the future. Since radio frequency radiation was graded 2B there have been more studies showing this increased risk. “In my view it should be on the same level as tobacco and asbestos. It should not be allowed in school.”  Schools in France, Belgium and parts of America already ban or limit wifi use. And campaigners are urging the UK to follow suit until more research is carried out. Mum-of-three Alisa Keane has taken her three sons out of school because she believes the wifi was making them ill. Alisa, of Downpatrick, Co Down, said James, nine, Conn, seven, and six-year-old Dara suffered headaches, nausea and concentration issues. She is now home schooling them after seeing how the “fog” lifted away from the classroom.  And in Doncaster, dad Paul Lewis removed daughter Jessica from her junior school into a private academy after she developed headaches when wifi was introduced in the classroom. Accountant Paul says Jessica, now 15, no longer suffers the mysterious symptoms. He said: “The frustrating thing is there is no need for school wifi. “They should be using cables until it can be proved there is no risk from electromagnetic fields.”  Sarah Dacre, a trustee of charity Electrosensitivity UK, says they help “hundreds” of people with symptoms including tinnitus , skin rashes, muscle pains and memory loss.   She said: “There are clinics overseas which regularly diagnose ES with a range of tests. “But there are no such places in the UK and most GPs have no training in handling it. “New ES cases often tell us they’re unable to use smartphones or wifi routers, and that installation of smart meters has made their lives impossible.” Diana Hanson, of the Safe School Information Technology Alliance, says parents convinced wifi is making their children sick are often “extremely distressed”. She said: “People say the risk is minimal by comparing it to things on the Group 2B list such as coffee and exhaust fumes. “But we don’t give our children 10 coffees a day or sit them in a room full of running cars.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather incredible lightning storms","story":"News\u0027Mother of all thunder storms\u0027: Dramatic bolt of lightning illuminates sky above The Shard as storm engulfs LondonA Met Office warning of heavy thunderstorms played out in dramatic style on Saturday night\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ShentonUS Showbiz Editor (Digital)Ryan Wilkinson00:54, 27 MAY 2018Updated04:18, 27 MAY 2018NewsThe storms hit late on Saturday evening\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of stunned Brits have taken to social media to share pictures and video footage of the dramatic thunder and lightning storms that fell over London and parts of the South East on Saturday night. Forecasters had earlier warned that homes and businesses could be flooded, with damage to some buildings coming as a result of the strikes as well as hail and strong winds. And after a run of good weather and temperatures of 27C, the storms finally hit on Saturday night as dramatic flashes of light were captured by stunned weather watchers. One incredible picture captured a huge lightning bolt illuminating the sky above The Shard in London. BBC weatherman Tomasz Schafernaker tweeted: Mother of all #thunderstorms now over London. Oh boy! This UTTERLY INSANE.   I\u0027ve never seen a storm with such frequent lightning in my life I don\u0027t think. Mostly sheet lightning and not too loud but flashes are spectacular. Photographer and journalist Andrew Lanxon Hoyle shared an image of the Suleymaniye Mosque in Dalston, east London, lit from behind by a brilliant fork of lightning, tweeting: The lightning storm over London right now is utterly INTENSE. Never seen lightning so relentless like this before.. or that colour, another Twitter user said.  Pamelasaurusrex shared a photo on Instagram of two people running for shelter outside King\u0027s Cross Station as a lightning bolt arced across the sky over nearby St Pancras. James Brewin captured the moment Big Ben and Westminster were illuminated by a flash of lightning, describing it as London in daylight at midnight for a split second. While someone else described the storm over London like an opening scene in Labyrinth. The storms could be the first of many as much of the south of England and Wales had been subject to a yellow weather warning throughout Saturday and today.         The north of England may only be struck later today, but Scotland is predicted to bask in sunshine through until Monday, according to Met Office meteorologist Sarah Kent. She said: It is going to be a warm weekend and I think nearly everybody will see some sunshine, but the big caveat is that because it\u0027s been quite humid, particularly southern parts are at risk of seeing some quite heavy showers.   It could possibly develop into some heavy thundery outbreaks over the next 48 hours. Despite the quite torrential showers, Ms Kent said temperatures are set to reach 24C (75F) in the south while Glasgow could be as high as 22C (72F) on Sunday.

Little Clara and Cutler, both two, have been inseparable since their mums brought them together when they were only a few months old. Clara\u0027s mother Lana Beaton, 39, and Cutler\u0027s mum Amy Sanders, 43, knew each other growing up in North Dakota, US. But they were never close friends until they both welcomed children with Down\u0027s syndrome within months of each other.   Mum-of-four Lana, who gave birth to Clara in November 2015, sent school teacher Amy a Facebook message after she heard from a mutual friend that her son Cutler, born in February 2016, also had the condition.   The parents arranged to meet in a local Starbucks in April 2016, where Clara and Cutler hit it off and the toddlers have been best buddies ever since. The incredibly cute pair spend at least two days a week together and share their physical, occupational and speech therapy sessions. The mums say bubbly Clara has a positive influence on Cutler, who is a little shy, and is one of the only people who can bring him out of his shell. The pair love playing tag, watching movies and getting up to mischief together. Lana said: “Amy and I knew each other growing up – our parents were good friends.  However, we never really ran in the same circles and as we grew up we lost touch. “A friend of mine came over to see Clara one day and she told me that she was certain that Amy had just welcomed a little boy with DS. “After I found out at 20 weeks that Clara had DS, I joined a lot of the local groups in our area. I thought my connecting with Amy we might be a good support for one another. “I sent her a sensitive message asking her if Cutler had an extra chromosome like Clara and Amy wrote back within an hour. “We met up about a week later in a local Starbucks and we really connected.  We laid the babies out on a blanket and they started touching each other – you could see that there was a connection there between them. Amy said: “It was really amazing to connect with Lana because she’s such an amazing advocate for Down\u0027s syndrome. “We first met up at the bookstore and we brought the babies with us. “Lana is such a calming and confident person and became a great support to me. We arranged some play dates for them both the rest is history.” “Clara is very outgoing and she will tell you what’s what! Cutler is shy and reserved. He admires people from afar but he’s definitely more cautious than Clara.  We try to have play dates as often as we can and they have their speech and occupational therapies together twice a week. “Everybody is blown away by their friendship. Everybody is smitten with them.” Despite her big personality, Clara has faced many medical setbacks. The toddler underwent open heart surgery when she was just three months old and as a result she is fed through a G-tube in her stomach. Clara also lives with Hirschsprung’s disease, a condition that impacts the nerves in her colon making it difficult to pass stool. Although Clara is always in and out of hospital, her mom Lana says she loves watching videos of Culter from her hospital bed.

Dramatic images show the killers tossing and turning during an intense battle in the river.  The croc eventually comes out on top, with the viper clamped and thrashing beneath his powerful jaws before being gobbled down by his prey .  The dramatic incident was spotted at Yala National Park in Sri Lanka by Rishani Gunasinghe, a Patent Technology Specialist.  Rish said: “This was one such occasion. We came across a small waterhole by the main road that was home to a small croc, which most Jeeps seemed to ignore and pass by, crocs not being rare in the island. “However, there was something that initially appeared to be small and white close by, which sparked our interest and made us stop for a closer look. “Soon the croc took the white thing into its mouth and lifted it revealing a snake, and first, seeing only the underbelly and the enormous size, we assumed it was a python.  “After a few quick photographs, I noticed the unmistakable chain of dorsal spots and realized it was actually a Russell\u0027s Viper.” The Russell\u0027s Viper is one of the most dangerous snakes in all of Asia, accounting for thousands of deaths each year. Once bitten, people reportedly experience pain, swelling, vomiting, dizziness, blood clots and kidney failure. Rish added: “Seeing a Russell’s viper in the wild, one of the deadliest snakes in the world, was indeed a treat, but to see a croc with one of possibly record size, and the superb spins and tosses displayed by the croc in trying to kill and devour the viper, was quite a show and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime encounter.

The discount chain has been slammed for its decision to use factories in China, Turkey and Myanmar - which all have an appalling history with gay rights. Homosexuality is technically illegal in Myanmar, formerly Burma, with punishments ranging from 10 years to life in prison. While it is not illegal in China, authorities and social networking companies in the country have attempted to clamp down on LGBT people online. And in Turkey, gay people are routinely subjected to violence and persecution, including when Turkish riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to break up a rally staged by the LGBT community in Istanbul . Primark has said it takes LGBT rights very seriously and that items in the range are sourced from a variety of different countries.   Primark are now selling RuPaul Drag Race t-shirts - but only in these few stores  People were protesting against a ban on Trans Pride and were calling for justice for transgender woman and LGBT activist Hande Kader after she was found dead in a forest. LGBT activist Steve Taylor told The Sun : “Imagine living in a country where you have to hide your sexuality, for fear of violence, reprisals or worse. Imagine working in Primark’s factory, churning out this stuff. “That is not acceptance without exception, by anyone’s standards.” The range of rainbow-themed t-shirts, caps and accessories - produced in partnership with LGBT charity Stonewall - were unveiled this week, reports Pink News .  Stonewall will receive 20 percent of the proceeds - despite cutting ties with London Pride last year after a reported fall-out between the charity and organisers. Three Primark stores near Gloucestershire - in Cardiff, Birmingham and Bristol - are stocking the Pride range. Jason Potter-Peachey, chairman of Pride in Gloucestershire, said: It gives the impression to Jo Public that you can buy this and the money will go to Pride. It\u0027s launched in time for Pride season and they have branded it as \u0027Pride-ready\u0027. It\u0027s a bit of a kick in the teeth on a local angle. Mr Potter-Peachey, membership director of UK Pride Organisers Network, added that Stonewall has little involvement in Pride events, reports Gloucestershire Live .  A Primark spokesman said: “We take LGBT rights very seriously which is why we have created a range of Pride products with Stonewall, one of Europe’s leading LGBT rights charities. We will donate 20 per cent of the sales of these products to support Stonewall’s important work, which includes campaigning globally for LGBT rights. The items in our Pride range are sourced from a variety of different countries, and as is the case with all our products, the country of origin is clearly indicated on the label.” Stonewall said in a statement: When Primark decided to launch a summer Pride range we were proud and pleased that they approached us about a partnership. They want to work with us to help embed long-term, generational change for LGBT people in the UK and internationally.

Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked.

Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Viridor_Fire_Perth-8.jpg.jpg ","title":"lithium ion batteries may have

the cost to build “Nou Campy” are understood to have been between £15m and £18m, the Dark Blues will plough ahead with the project they hope to complete by 2020.A site between Camperdown Park and the city’s Ice Arena has been earmarked for the state-of-the-art facility that would include training pitches, a retail park and housing development.The fact it’s also adjacent to the Kingsway, however, means close scrutiny is being paid to how it would be accessed.Transport Scotland, the body responsible for the country’s trunk roads, require certain conditions to be met before they’ll give their blessing.Best case scenario would be for a new slip road to be included, meaning costs could be kept to a minimum.The stumbling block with that would be traffic only being able to enter and exit on the northbound carriageway of the A90.If that meant a new junction had to be constructed to allow access for south-bound vehicles, the increase in cost would run well into seven figures.Talks between

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

in control of highlighting road safety issues for their own schoolmates.The programme is particularly empowering for the senior pupils of P6 and P7 giving them the opportunity to become JRSOs for a year.Their tasks are to organise a road safety noticeboard deliver safety presentations to classes or assemblies and run school road safety competitions.Training days were organised by Highland Council\u0027 road safety team this week at Eden Court, Inverness, and in Wick.At the training days the new JRSO\u0027 were provided with information from a number of organisations to help them undertake their roles within their schools including Highland Council, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Road Safety Scotland Breedon Sustrans and HiTrans Living Streets Police Scotland and Cycling Scotland.At the Inverness event 236 JRSOs took take part representing 57 schools, while in Wick 59 JRSOs attended the training representing 13 schools.Councillor Allan Henderson, chairman of council\u0027 environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"Saving lives is what these two very important training days were all about.\"The training provided helps senior pupils to

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).
