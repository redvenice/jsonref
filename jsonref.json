The Duchesse ivory silk-satin creation took royal couturier Sir Norman and his team three months to finishWith a heart-shaped neckline with scalloped edge, the gown was decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, glittering crystals and featured an intricate 13ft star-patterned train. Embroidered with roses, star-shaped flowers and wheat in pearl, crystal and appliques of transparent tulle, its floral design was seen as a symbol of growth and regeneration after the hardships of the Second World War. On the day of the wedding at Westminster Cathedral, the seamstresses who worked tirelessly on the gown were given a prime spot outside Buckingham Palace as a reward.  The Queen, like all British brides in the post-war days, was given 200 extra clothing coupons from the Government towards her wedding trousseau.Women across the UK, keen to ensure Princess Elizabeth would have the dress of her dreams, sent their own coupons to the young royal to help out.But it was illegal to give coupons away and the gifts had to be returned.  However, The Crown gave a good idea of how much the dress might cost to make today as designers for the BBC programme created an identical gown for the wedding scene, which cost £30,000.

Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

These days it is used mainly for entertainingIn fact, their dinner party had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast, with Harry’s favourite House tracks ‘curated’ by DJ Sam Totolee (who also performed at Pippa Middleton’s wedding), a ‘drinks of the world’ themed bar, and candyfloss and ‘dirty burgers’ as midnight snacks.One source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was put on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry’s red hair. It was named ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, a play on the film When Harry Met Sally.The party was a notably relaxed, more youthful occasion than the afternoon reception.The intimate guestlist of 200 meant there was no room for mere acquaintances, nor even many minor Royals. Pippa Middleton and Harry’s party-girl ex Chelsy Davy were expected to be absentees.There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertaining.The sit-down dinner was strictly organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed ‘spring meets summer’. The meal, paid for by the Prince of Wales, started at 7.30pm and finished at around 10pm.Its three courses were understood to have been peppered with ‘naughty’ speeches from Prince William and a joint effort from Tom Inskip, known as ‘Skippy’ and Tom Van Straubenzee. Any crude nods to Prince Harry’s playboy past were held back until the older guests had departed.Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027          The revamped classic car\u0027s number plate read \u0027E190518\u0027 - a tribute to the newlywed\u0027s wedding date.

Another party had been planned in a soundproofed private home in Chelsea.It was quite a contrast with the earlier ‘stand-up’ wedding breakfast in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall, which saw 600 guests enjoy ‘bowl food’ and canapes such as Scottish langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon, croquette of confit Windsor Lamb and champagne and pistachio macarons. Harry and his father then gave speeches. Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said of Harry’s speech: ‘He was talking about his wife. Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.’She described a speech by the Prince of Wales as ‘lovely’, adding: ‘Essentially it was just about how Harry was as a child and growing up. And about the couple and how beautiful they are together.’Another guest said: ‘Charles nailed it in his speech. He talked about Harry being a baby needing bottles and diapers, then said: “Look how well he turned out.” ’    Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone.

Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.

The stunning leather interior of the car driven by the Duke of Sussex away from Windsor CastleIt was known in-house as ‘Project Dylan’, a nod to singer-song-writer Bob Dylan’s controversial switch in the mid 1960-s from acoustic to electric guitar when one traditionalist fan shouted ‘Judas.’But converting the classic E-Type means owners can ‘future proof’ their classic cars, says Jaguar. The original engine can even, if required, be swapped back.It can accelerate from rest to 62mph in 5.5 seconds – about a second faster than the original petrol version – with a top speed 150mph. However, with Prince Harry at the wheel he appeared to be taking things much more sensibly.The electric E-Type claims a ‘real world’ range of about 170 miles though that could increase to just over 200 miles. So there was little risk of running out of juice for the short hop between engagements at Windsor.It can be fully charged at home overnight in about six to seven hours with the fuel cap flap opening to reveal the electric charging point.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drive off from Windsor Castle in a fully electric version of Jaguar’s legendary E-Type sports car          Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027If they had time to to avert their gaze from each other, the road ahead, and the cheering well-wishers, Harry and Meghan may have had time to admire how the original dashboard has been replaced with hi-tech carbon-fibre and the classic instruments given a digital revamp with hi-tech ‘virtual’ dials showing road speed and engine speed.But all other underpinnings, including brakes and suspension are the same, to ensure it still drives like the ‘original’ E-Type.The one-off electric E-Type would cost around £350,000 although Jaguar says prices could drop as more orders are received. But with its new royal connection, this one could now be priceless.Tim Hannig, director, Jaguar Land Rover Classic, said other models could follow: ‘Our aim with E-type Zero is to future-proof classic car ownership.’‘The Jaguar E-type Zero not only drives and looks like an E-type, it also offers outstanding performance. It’s quicker than an original E-type: 0-62mph takes only 5.5 sec, about one second quicker than a Series 1 E-type. But it is authentic to its DNA.’Jaguar said the restored Series 1.5 Roadster is’ totally original apart from its 21st century electric powertrain and modified instrumentation and facia. It also has LED headlights to save energy. The Zero’s lithium-ion battery pack has the same dimensions as the original XK six-cylinder petrol engine and sits in precisely the same place. The 220kW motor lies just behind the battery pack where the original gearbox used to be.          Under the bonnet: Jaguar have replaced the powerful petrol engine with a zero emissions electric motor and plug-in battery          The boot of the stunning Jaguar driven by the Duke of Sussex on Saturday after his weddingOne of Jaguar’s own restored ‘Reborn’ range – with a petrol engine - would be £280,000. Classic E-Types can cost from around £70,000, depending on condition. Back in the 1960s a new E-Type cost just a few thousand pounds.The electric E-Type Zero was one of three battery-powered cars that Jaguar showcased at its special ‘Tech Fest’ event in London last Autumn.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive officer Dr Ralf Speth said: ‘Every new Jaguar Land Rover model line will be electrified from 2020, giving our customers even more choice. We will introduce a portfolio of electrified products across our model range, embracing fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.’There is already a strong link between the Royal Family and Jaguar Land Rover.In April Prince Charles became the first VIP to be seen in Jaguar’s new I-PACE electric car – on the day that the heir to the throne was confirmed as the Queen’s successor as head of the Commonwealth.He used the all-new electric Jaguar I-PACE for official duties at during the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meetings – having been kept abreast of its hi-tech and environmentally-friendly development towards more ‘green’ electric cars for more than a year.The new I-PACE was unveiled at the Geneva motor in Spring with first customer deliveries begin in June priced from £62,000 to £84,000. The zero-emissions coupe accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds with a top speed of 298 miles and enough battery charge to drive 300 miles from London to Newcastle on one charge.Jaguar Land Rover his the only car maker to hold three royal warrants: from the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles. JLR’s German-born chief executive Dr Ralf Speth has an honorary knighthood, which ca be granted to foreign nations, but recently took up UK citizenship.The Queen is regularly seen and photographed driving Land Rovers around her royal estates and, as Hon Second Subaltern Princess Elizabeth, trained during the war as a truck mechanic with the Territorial Service ‘ATS’.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/18/4C78CD8B00000578-5750501-One_runner_asks_the_driver_Are_you_f_stupid_as_another_says_I_m_-a-4_1526837413876.jpg","title":"Astonishing moment motorist drives car path half marathon runners ignoring restrictions","story":"    Driver was caught on camera in Plymouth knocking over a cone and almost injuring runners as they attempt to block the vehicle ploughing into participants in the city\u0027s half marathon          One runner asks the driver \u0027Are you f******* stupid?\u0027 as another says \u0027I\u0027m a police officer you\u0027re breaking the law\u0027          There\u0027s no indication the woman wanted to cause any harm and goes on to explain she\u0027s attempting to get out of the city to work, not knowing which way to go          More runners pile in and say \u0027The road is closed, you\u0027re just going to have to wait and another adds \u0027don\u0027t be so stupid, you\u0027re going to kill someone\u0027          A Plymouth City council Highways official races over, telling the driver \u0027don\u0027t move, stay there\u0027           The woman then replies: \u0027I can\u0027t get out...listen, I have tried to get out every which way\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/16/4C788C3500000578-5750557-image-m-18_1526831395577.jpg","title":"The voice viral yanny vs laurel debate revealed Broadway actor","story":"    Jay Aubrey Jones , 64, has been revealed as the viral voice recordingThe voice behind the viral \u0027yanny\u0027 vs \u0027laurel\u0027 sensation has been revealed to be a Broadway actor and singer.Jay Aubrey Jones, 64 , was trained in pronunciation and has admitted that he recorded the word \u0027laurel\u0027 for Vocabulary.com in 2007.Now 11 years later, Jones\u0027 voice has gone viral with the actor saying one thing and hundreds of thousand of people hearing another. \u0027I recorded my batch of words,\u0027 he told TIME,  \u0027and I thought that was that.\u0027 In total he recorded about 36,000 words over the course of six months, according to Vocabulary.com, a site that teaches words and pronunciations. The New Jersey native said he was \u0027amused to no end\u0027 when he found out his voice had created heated debate consuming social media and even involving celebrities. \u0027I thought, well, it couldn\u0027t be that huge. Then I heard the recording again online and I realized what a brouhaha this whole thing was,\u0027 Jones said. The actor, who has starred in CATS on Broadway and made television appearances on the Michael J Fox show, said he himself is Team Laurel.\u0027More often than not, I hear laurel,\u0027 Jones said. \u0027I can hear a slight trace of \u0027yanny.\u0027      Jones said he recorded the word \u0027laurel\u0027 in 2007 for Vocabulary.com          After being shared on Reddit, the video of the word \u0027laurel\u0027 went viral as others heard \u0027yanny\u0027 The word \u0027laurel\u0027 itself refers to a wreath worn on a head as a sign of victory.A student found herself astounded when she read \u0027laurel\u0027 but heard \u0027yanny\u0027 last week.After being shared on Reddit, the video migrated over to Twitter and in one day, the word \u0027yanny\u0027 had been used more than 310,000 times and \u0027laurel\u0027 gained nearly 330,000 mentions as social media users reveal what they hear in the audio clip, according to the BBC.  The words are not an illusion but an ambiguous figure similar to that seen with The Dress and Rubin’s vase, according to Lars Riecke, an Assistant Professor at Maastricht University.‘The input can be organized in two alternative ways,’ Riecke said to The Verge. He went on to explain that it all depends on frequency.Now there is a VISUAL to go along with  the great debate...They can\u0027t agree on anything! White House releases jokey...Share this article‘The acoustic information that makes us hear Yanny is higher frequency than the acoustic information that makes us hear Laurel.‘Some of the variation may be due to the audio system playing the sound. But some of it is also the mechanics of your ears, and what you’re expecting to hear.\u0027While older adults tend to start losing their hearing at higher frequency ranges, they are more likely to hear Laurel, which also means that younger people can hear Yanny.This also explains why, if you listen on a device with a different frequency, you may hear Yanny when you heard Laurel at first, and vice.          Jones is a New Jersey native who is an actor and singer and trained in pronunciation      Celebrities including Chrissy Teigen, Stephen King and Ellen Degeneres have shared whether they are Team Yanny or Team Laurel.Emmy Rossum and Stephen Colbert took to Twitter and said they started off one way and now can hear both. Perhaps they were listening on different devices which made the switch. Though the social media crazy continues, folks can rest easy knowing once and for all that it is in fact \u0027laurel\u0027 that\u0027s being said.       Jay Aubrey Jones Is the Voice of the Laurel or Yanny Meme | Time"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C66FE5600000578-5751171-image-a-7_1526851025898.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding makes history attracting viewers UK","story":"    The wedding of an American princess proved to be a hit with US viewers, with 17.5 million viewers tuning in to watch on the big three networks, eclipsing the 17 million who watched in UK.

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.Sore heads? Wills and Kate cover their eyes with sunglasses...George who-ney? Police keep actor and his wife waiting for...Share this articleAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter’s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"Take style tips from Julia in a dress by Tom FordFind it at Farfetch!Deciding what to wear to a wedding can be tricky at the best of times, but when it\u0026#39s the wedding of the century...

The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

Some even believed the space in front of the Queen was left empty for Princess DianaThen there was the bridal bouquet of forget-me-nots — the Princess’s favourite — that Harry hand-picked from the walled garden at Nottingham Cottage, his home at Kensington Palace.The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is Trustee and Founder Patron of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/00/4C6DE1E800000578-5751563-image-a-5_1526860191218.jpg","title":"Copy blue number worn Meghans best friend Miss Mulroney available online 1 000","story":"    A pop-up collection by Di Carlo Couture went live on the morning of the wedding with the ‘Jessica’ dress – a replica of Miss Mulroney’s form-fitting number, available to purchase for £1,100Her seven-year-old twin boys Brian and John played a key part in the wedding ceremony, carrying the bride’s train.But mother Jessica Mulroney appears to be carving out a starring role of her own.While the 37-year-old Canadian mother-of-three, who is Meghan’s best friend and closest confidante, was circumspect online, the style guru and her outfits were plastered over social media by her associates.The PR consultant and bridal expert, who has been dubbed Toronto’s Gwyneth Paltrow, met Meghan when the actress moved to the city to film US legal drama Suits and the pair bonded over a love of yoga.Over the weekend Instagram addict Miss Mulroney posted just a single photograph on her Instagram account – a picture of her twins holding Meghan’s train as she walked up the steps of St George’s Chapel on Saturday. ‘Proud friend.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"  Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s datePrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.  George and Amal Clooney were the among the huge stars to celebrate with Harry and Meghan with George dancing with the bride and Kate   From left: Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams and Jessica Mulroney show off the dresses they wore to the royal wedding party          Revellers watch the fireworks display over George III\u0027s former stately where the reception of Harry and Meghan took placeExclusive details from inside the evening celebrations reveal that guests – including George and Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John and David Furnish and more glitzy actresses than an Oscars after-party – spent the evening sipping bespoke cocktails, tucking into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss from outdoor stalls and dancing to a trendy DJ.It was, insiders say, \u0027the party to end all parties\u0027, with a carnival atmosphere in the grounds of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to George III.  Record viewing figures made Harry and Meghan’s wedding the TV event of the year so far.It was watched by a peak of 13.1million just after 1pm on BBC1, making it the biggest peak figure so far in 2018, the broadcaster said. ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C6B70BB00000578-5752413-image-m-23_1526890066091.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland NOT filming interview Oprah Winfrey","story":"Doria Ragland is not planning to film an interview with Oprah Winfrey, it emerged today  Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

So, when you are doing embroidery, you need to keep your hands very fresh.‘There were many people involved in the workmanship and, obviously, it took an enormous amount of hours to do it.’The idea to embroider each of the 53 Commonwealth flowers on to the veil was the designer’s idea, after long discussions with Meghan, who wanted to include a tribute to the ‘Family of Nations’ that will be such a central part of her new life, working on behalf of the Queen.‘There was a conversation early on about the story that we were going to tell through this wedding,’ she said. ‘And the fact she and Prince Harry will be working a lot in the Commonwealth was something that could be built on.’It was Meghan, however, who came up with the idea for the simple, but utterly enchanting, little bridesmaids’ outfits.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027.

You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C77614C00000578-5753665-image-a-110_1526913292811.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan plan one night mini moon jet Ireland","story":"    Unlike other newlyweds, Harry and Meghan will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away          The couple are set to go straight back to royal duty, carrying out their first official engagements as husband and wifeThe couple, who exchanged vows in a ceremony watched by millions across the world on Saturday, are due to attend a Buckingham Palace garden party on Tuesday as part of the Prince of Wales\u0027s 70th birthday celebrations.It will mark the beginning of a new life for former actress Meghan, who has already spoken of her desire to \u0027hit the ground running\u0027 in her role as a full-time royal.  Meghan Markle being welcomed into the Royal Family is...British designer who created Meghan’s wedding dress kept it...Share this articleHarry is yet to visit Ireland but Meghan spent time in the country as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014 and they are expected to return in the coming weeks.  A visit to Australia is also in the diary for October, for the 2018 Invictus Games, while other trips abroad this year are said to be in the pipeline.     The pair are reportedly planning a \u0027mini moon\u0027 in Ireland ahead of the summer The couple are expected to then continue their tour Down Under to include visits to New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, with plans being discussed at the highest level. But despite their hectic schedules, the couple seized the opportunity to spend some time away from the public eye on Sunday.After two receptions hosted by the Queen and Prince of Wales on Saturday - with some guests said to have continued partying well after Frogmore House closed its doors - the royal newlyweds left Windsor Castle on Sunday afternoon for some well-earned privacy.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C79868F00000578-5753667-image-a-9_1526912381432.jpg","title":"Turkeys President Erdogan calls Europes Muslims support him","story":"    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks during an election campaign rally of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on SundayThe presidential and parliamentary polls on June 24 will see Turkey switch to a powerful, executive presidential system that was narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Erdogan sees himself as a \u0027protector of Muslims in former Ottoman dominions,\u0027  Janusz Bugajski, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) told the Stockholm Center for Freedom.    \u0027As European Turks you have always supported us by a wide margin. Now we need your support again in the elections on June 24,\u0027 Erdogan told a rally in a Sarejevo sports hall, where supporters waved Turkish and Bosnian flags.Ahead of the 2017 referendum, ministers travelled to countries with big Turkish communities -- including Germany and the Netherlands -- to urge support for the change, but were stopped from campaigning by authorities citing security fears.Erdogan nevertheless said last month he was expecting to hold a campaign rally in a European city.          Some 15,000 supporters gathered to attend the AKP\u0027s rally ahead of the 24 June snap elections in Turkey          About three million Turks living abroad are eligible to vote in the election\u0027At a time when renowned European countries claiming to be the cradle of civilisation failed, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed by allowing us to gather here that it is a real democracy not a so-called one,\u0027 he told the crowd.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who heads a right-wing coalition opposed to Turkey joining the European Union, said last month Erdogan would be barred from \u0027trying to exploit\u0027 Europe\u0027s Turkish communities.Germany, home to about 3 million people of Turkish origin, says it will not allow foreign politicians to campaign on its territory ahead of elections.Earlier in the day, Erdogan pledged a multi-billion euro investment in a motorway connecting Belgrade and Sarajevo.Thousands of Turks came from Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, and from across the Balkans for the rally.\u0027Turkey is our mother nation,\u0027 said Coskun Celiloglu, a Macedonian student of Turkish descent. \u0027We came to Sarajevo just for one day to support our saviour Erdogan.\u0027The most popular -- and isive -- politician in recent Turkish history, Erdogan has ruled for 15 years, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth. But a widespread crackdown against his opponents has led rights groups and Western allies of the NATO member to voice concerns about Turkey\u0027s record on civil rights and Erdogan\u0027s growing authoritarianism.On Saturday, Turkey\u0027s state-run Anadolu agency reported there had been tip-offs about a potential assassination attempt against Erdogan while he visits the Balkans.Asked about the report, Erdogan said: \u0027This news reached me and indeed that is why I am here ...

Some even believed the space in front of the Queen was left empty for Princess DianaThen there was the bridal bouquet of forget-me-nots — the Princess’s favourite — that Harry hand-picked from the walled garden at Nottingham Cottage, his home at Kensington Palace.The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is Trustee and Founder Patron of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/00/4C6DE1E800000578-5751563-image-a-5_1526860191218.jpg","title":"Copy blue number worn Meghans best friend Miss Mulroney available online 1 000","story":"    A pop-up collection by Di Carlo Couture went live on the morning of the wedding with the ‘Jessica’ dress – a replica of Miss Mulroney’s form-fitting number, available to purchase for £1,100Her seven-year-old twin boys Brian and John played a key part in the wedding ceremony, carrying the bride’s train.But mother Jessica Mulroney appears to be carving out a starring role of her own.While the 37-year-old Canadian mother-of-three, who is Meghan’s best friend and closest confidante, was circumspect online, the style guru and her outfits were plastered over social media by her associates.The PR consultant and bridal expert, who has been dubbed Toronto’s Gwyneth Paltrow, met Meghan when the actress moved to the city to film US legal drama Suits and the pair bonded over a love of yoga.Over the weekend Instagram addict Miss Mulroney posted just a single photograph on her Instagram account – a picture of her twins holding Meghan’s train as she walked up the steps of St George’s Chapel on Saturday. ‘Proud friend.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C6B70BB00000578-5752413-image-m-23_1526890066091.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland NOT filming interview Oprah Winfrey","story":"Doria Ragland is not planning to film an interview with Oprah Winfrey, it emerged today  Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

Kate\u0026#39s Alexander McQueen gown has got to be one of the most copied styles of all time, and this breathtaking design is destined to be just as iconic. We\u0026#39ve all been speculating for months as to who Meghan might ask to create the all-important dress. Stella McCartney, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Burberry or perhaps Erdem? She kept us all guessing right up until the last moment, and as she arrived at St. George\u0026#39s Chapel in Windsor it was announced that it\u0026#39s the work of British designer Clare Waight Keller, Artistic Director at Givenchy. We love the elegant simplicity of this dress. The slight off shoulder neckline, the train... it\u0026#39s perfection. When teamed with Cartier jewellery, a dramatic veil and Queen Mary\u0026#39s diamond tiara, it\u0026#39s a fairy tale come true.

They have slippers for us. Slippers!\u0027Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles\u0027s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for \u0027navigating everything with such grace\u0027 after a turbulent week. \u0027We make such a great team,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie\u0027s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom \u0027Skippy\u0027 Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry\u0027s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for \u0027punching above his weight\u0027. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/14/4C7E0FA500000578-5752699-image-m-12_1526907643960.jpg","title":"Massive sinkhole suddenly opens swallowing three cars Chinese construction site","story":"    Three cars that parked near a construction site are dragged into a sinkhole in east China          The road collapses and opens a 10-foot-deep hole and swallows three vehicles instantlyHorrifying moment girl dangerously balances on a window...End of the birth-control policy: China \u0027plans to abolish all...Baby nearly drowns after his swimming ring flips, leaving...China starts its bid to land the FIRST spacecraft on the...Share this articleAccording to China Central Television, the sinkhole took place at Lin\u0027an district in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province at early hours on May 20.Three vehicles including a black SUV, a white car and a white minivan, fell into a hole where  a massive drainage pipe to be installed in a trench.Nearby residents told Tianqi. com that there were drainage pipe installation works being carried out at the site.Some believed the frequent rain around the region has soften the soil around the construction site and caused the road to collapse.

The fence that we built is still there.\u0027Obviously, I would prefer it in a weird way for him not to have been there, and for us to not know where he was.\u0027Because then we know that he\u0027s happy with a family member, but sadly for him that\u0027s not the case.\u0027Prince Harry mentioned fatherhood in the documentary and while reflecting on his aid work, he mused: \u0027For me I have this love of Africa that will never disappear... and I hope that it carries on with my children as well.\u0027Harry also received praise in the documentary from Sir Elton John, who urged people to go to see the work being done by Sentebale. He said: \u0027If his mother was alive, she\u0027d still be doing the work she set out to be doing, and he\u0027s carrying it on in the best possible way.\u0027Royal Wedding: Prince Harry flies in befriended Lesotho orphan in touching gesture | Royal | News | Express.co.uk"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C6FA5BE00000578-5753647-image-m-7_1526913143257.jpg","title":"PIERS MORGAN Congrats Meghan tough start lecturing equality palace","story":"    Congratulations on a stunningly successful wedding, Duchess. You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C77614C00000578-5753665-image-a-110_1526913292811.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan plan one night mini moon jet Ireland","story":"    Unlike other newlyweds, Harry and Meghan will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away          The couple are set to go straight back to royal duty, carrying out their first official engagements as husband and wifeThe couple, who exchanged vows in a ceremony watched by millions across the world on Saturday, are due to attend a Buckingham Palace garden party on Tuesday as part of the Prince of Wales\u0027s 70th birthday celebrations.It will mark the beginning of a new life for former actress Meghan, who has already spoken of her desire to \u0027hit the ground running\u0027 in her role as a full-time royal.  Meghan Markle being welcomed into the Royal Family is...British designer who created Meghan’s wedding dress kept it...Share this articleHarry is yet to visit Ireland but Meghan spent time in the country as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014 and they are expected to return in the coming weeks.  A visit to Australia is also in the diary for October, for the 2018 Invictus Games, while other trips abroad this year are said to be in the pipeline.     The pair are reportedly planning a \u0027mini moon\u0027 in Ireland ahead of the summer The couple are expected to then continue their tour Down Under to include visits to New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, with plans being discussed at the highest level. But despite their hectic schedules, the couple seized the opportunity to spend some time away from the public eye on Sunday.After two receptions hosted by the Queen and Prince of Wales on Saturday - with some guests said to have continued partying well after Frogmore House closed its doors - the royal newlyweds left Windsor Castle on Sunday afternoon for some well-earned privacy.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C79868F00000578-5753667-image-a-9_1526912381432.jpg","title":"Turkeys President Erdogan calls Europes Muslims support him","story":"    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks during an election campaign rally of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on SundayThe presidential and parliamentary polls on June 24 will see Turkey switch to a powerful, executive presidential system that was narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Erdogan sees himself as a \u0027protector of Muslims in former Ottoman dominions,\u0027  Janusz Bugajski, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) told the Stockholm Center for Freedom.    \u0027As European Turks you have always supported us by a wide margin. Now we need your support again in the elections on June 24,\u0027 Erdogan told a rally in a Sarejevo sports hall, where supporters waved Turkish and Bosnian flags.Ahead of the 2017 referendum, ministers travelled to countries with big Turkish communities -- including Germany and the Netherlands -- to urge support for the change, but were stopped from campaigning by authorities citing security fears.Erdogan nevertheless said last month he was expecting to hold a campaign rally in a European city.          Some 15,000 supporters gathered to attend the AKP\u0027s rally ahead of the 24 June snap elections in Turkey          About three million Turks living abroad are eligible to vote in the election\u0027At a time when renowned European countries claiming to be the cradle of civilisation failed, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed by allowing us to gather here that it is a real democracy not a so-called one,\u0027 he told the crowd.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who heads a right-wing coalition opposed to Turkey joining the European Union, said last month Erdogan would be barred from \u0027trying to exploit\u0027 Europe\u0027s Turkish communities.Germany, home to about 3 million people of Turkish origin, says it will not allow foreign politicians to campaign on its territory ahead of elections.Earlier in the day, Erdogan pledged a multi-billion euro investment in a motorway connecting Belgrade and Sarajevo.Thousands of Turks came from Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, and from across the Balkans for the rally.\u0027Turkey is our mother nation,\u0027 said Coskun Celiloglu, a Macedonian student of Turkish descent. \u0027We came to Sarajevo just for one day to support our saviour Erdogan.\u0027The most popular -- and isive -- politician in recent Turkish history, Erdogan has ruled for 15 years, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth. But a widespread crackdown against his opponents has led rights groups and Western allies of the NATO member to voice concerns about Turkey\u0027s record on civil rights and Erdogan\u0027s growing authoritarianism.On Saturday, Turkey\u0027s state-run Anadolu agency reported there had been tip-offs about a potential assassination attempt against Erdogan while he visits the Balkans.Asked about the report, Erdogan said: \u0027This news reached me and indeed that is why I am here ...

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.War was a frequent subject for discussion last week. Ben Macintyre’s Operation Mincemeat kept beerbart intrigued:Macintyre has a well-deserved reputation of crafting entertaining, accessible and informative narrative history particularly on war events or spy stories. This is no exception. I’m enjoying the rich cast of eccentrics and novelists (Ian Fleming was heavily involved in the plot and execution) all conspiring to fool the Germans who by all accounts were dreadful at this spy game during the war. Zigzag is his best book for me but this is running it close. Anne Frank’s diary has been in the news recently, and coincidentally, nina1414 has also just finished The Definitive Edition edited by Otto H Frank and Mirjam Pressler - and found it unexpectedly “uplifting”:As she points out herself, she never mopes. She takes comfort in looking at the sky - it makes her feel happy. She keeps busy and she has dreams for the future - she’d like to be a writer and she’d like to make a difference.One thing I hadn’t been aware of was that she and her family were actually German. She talks of wanting to take on Dutch nationality as she loves the country and is upset at the growing anti-Antisemitism there and hopes it is just a passing phase.I feel a bit bereft now. I’ve been reading 50 pages a day and now it’s come to an end.The Armies by Evelio Rosero, a “devastating portrait of life during the Colombian civil war”, fascinated Tom Mooney:Ismael, a slightly pervy retired teacher, spends his days picking oranges and spying on his neighbour as she sunbathes naked. He visits the cafe in town and chats with the locals. He spars with his wife of 40 years.But life in this small town is scarred by the ongoing war, which breezes sporadically through, leaving in its wake a hurricane of violence and death. Disappearances, murder, explosions, then gone. Which side was it this time? Who knows? Who cares? Written in sultry, classic prose, Rosero paints the profound effects of war on those innocent bystanders caught up in its terror.Elsewhere, fatbuddha1 has enjoyed the depiction of post-war Glasgow in Lennox by Craig Russell: It concerns a Canadian gumshoe, making a shady living in post war Glasgow. It’s very good on historical detail, I think, I know nothing of post war Glasgow but it rings true, and is excellent on disrespecting Edinburgh. I think the author had great fun thinking up so many inventive ways to slag the place and the people off.It’s a like a mash up of Chandler and Malcolm Mckay, with a bit of Carl Hiassen thrown in. The good news for me is that there is more where that came from, and I shall be enjoying the series.A wonderful novel about monastic life in Italy in the early 14th century. Covers the heresy hunt against Franciscan Spirituals, aspects of medieval philosophy, theology, etc, including the evils of the Inquisition. But it is mostly a fascinating detective story - William of Baskerville - brilliant. Though I did find Adso’s enthralment in church decoration etc and his naivety a bit longwinded.A wonderful new (Disc)world is opening up for janey smit who has just read Mort by Terry Pratchett:My first ever and I liked it. How about that?Finally Larts has re-read JL Carr’s I read A Month In The Country:I was, as ever, deeply moved by the whole novel. The humour and pathos coming so close together. It’s a short novel but boy does it cut deep. Do I weep for Birkin or myself at the end?It takes a special kind of book to make you feel that way...Interesting links about books and readingIf you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

He said Haines had “done an outstanding job at the CAA”.But he angered many within the organisation, who warned that its safety functions were being impaired as senior staff were made redundant and average salaries were slashed. A leaked internal report obtained by the  last year showed inspectors under Haines believed they no longer had sufficient resources to do the job properly. The CAA boss started his career in rail, as a left luggage clerk at London Victoria station, and later had stints as managing director at South West Trains then First Group’s rail ision. He is sits on the board of rolling stock leasing company Eversholt Rail UK, a post he will resign on joining Network Rail. He will take over a business plan for the next five years that will not commit Network Rail to grand engineering schemes after budgeting failures and cost overruns led to large parts of the current plan being abandoned, including electrification of parts of the Midland Mainline and lines in south Wales.Announcing the appointment, Network Rail’s chairman Sir Peter Hendy said Haines would ensure a continued focus on safety, performance and cost effectiveness: “Andrew’s broad experience of rail and transport, and his reputation for relentless delivery and improvement, makes him the ideal candidate to carry on with the transformation of Network Rail that has been led by Mark Carne.”Haines said he would work to “deliver closer working between track and train, embed devolution and turning the digital railway strategy into reality whilst efficiently delivering on challenging safety, operational, engineering and investment commitments”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea50c8c415b15830edfc1c997ff9e03b339cb03/0_300_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b48d9859e3865634d4cc989c228c7943","title":"ryanair hand luggage airline strikes profits michael oleary","story":"The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has said the airline may have to review its new luggage policy if large numbers of passengers continue to hand over their bags at the gate.Ryanair has introduced a stricter cabin bag policy, which means customers have to pay £5 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at the departure gate. This has improved boarding and punctuality, the airline said, but O’Leary added that “it is creating a handling issue, especially at peak periods” such as bank holiday weekends and during the summer.“There are many flights where we’re now having to put 100 or 120 gate bags free of charge into the hold,” O’Leary said in a video presentation. “If that continues to build, it’s something we may have to look at again.”However, O’Leary warned of a fall in profits this year, saying the outlook was “on the pessimistic side of cautious”. He said there could be strikes in some countries over Ryanair’s discussions to recognise trade unions, but the airline would face any action down.O’Leary said air fares were likely to be flat over the coming year, as it takes about 12 months for changes in fuel prices to feed through to fares. He added that he believed airlines that had not hedged oil prices, such as Norwegian, would struggle next winter and that this would “accelerate the shakeout” in the industry, with some carriers going bust.Ryanair averted widespread Christmas strikes by unilaterally recognising unions in December for the first time in its 32-year history, but it has struggled to formalise relations in some countries. “Being unionised means we will have occasional strikes,” O’Leary said.Ryanair repeated its warnings about the risk of a hard Brexit, and said it would scrap voting rights for non-EU shareholders if there was no transition agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b611449a1227eaaa4ece9443d720da9fc692a42/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d64f8414a898b311368b432428b008","title":"big tech products silicon valley","story":"It’s years since Silicon Valley gave us a game-changer. Instead, from curing disease to colonies on Mars, we’re fed overblown promisesBack in 1999, Google hit 1bn searches a year. Wifi began to make an impact about two years later. Thanks to the pioneers of Facebook and Twitter, the age of mass social media dawned between 2004 and 2006 – and non-stop posting, messaging and following was soon enabled by the iPhone, launched in 2007. These things have changed the world and, in hindsight, the way they became ubiquitous had a powerful sense of inevitability. But the revolution they represented is old now, and nothing comparable has come along for more than a decade.Despite this, a regular ritual of hype and hysteria is now built into the news cycle. Every now and again, at some huge auditorium, a senior staff member at one of the big firms based in northern California – ordinarily a man – will take the stage dressed in box-fresh casualwear, and inform the gathered multitudes of some hitherto unimagined leap forward, supposedly destined to transform millions of lives. (There will be whoops and gasps in response, and a splurge of media coverage – before, in the wider world, a palpable feeling of anticlimax sets in.)It happened again a fortnight ago, when the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, addressed his company’s annual developers’ conference. Among his other tasks, he was there to rhapsodise about developments in artificial intelligence, and the ever-evolving application known as Google Assistant (created, he said, to “help you get things done”), and a new innovation called Duplex. “It turns out that a big part of getting things done is making a phone call,” he said. He then mentioned getting an appointment for a haircut: “You know, we’re working hard to get users through those moments.”The screens behind him lit up, and the sound system played a synthesised female voice, whose words were punctuated with authentic-sounding umms and aahs. The voice conversed with a human being at the other end of a phone line, who apparently had no idea she was talking to a machine, and the software seemed to quickly and seamlessly secure a 10am appointment. Pockets of the crowd went into raptures. “That was a real call you just heard,” said Pichai. “The amazing thing is, our Assistant can actually understand the nuances of conversation.”Now, when was the last time you came to book a haircut or restaurant table and concluded that the task was so onerous that you would ideally delegate it to a machine? And even if you can easily think of a scenario, would there not be something ethically questionable about doing so, if the person at the other end had no idea who or what they were talking to? In fact, might Duplex be a grim portal into a future in which high-flyers get digital “assistants” to do their chores, while poorly paid people have to meekly talk to computers, in constant fear that they are about to be automated into joblessness?Pichai also announced the introduction of a new feature of Gmail called Smart Compose: a kind of supercharged predictive text that offers you extended phrases as you type, which then build up into whole sentences. (To quote one report, the software will “tailor its predictions to each inidual user, based … on information that Google already knows about you”.) Pichai showed an email exchange in which Smart Compose understood that the matter at hand was “Taco Tuesday”, and suggested “chips, salsa, and guacamole”. Hearing more whoops of delight from the audience, I thought about a vision of the near future in which half the human race will converse in preordained cliches.The endless noise emanating from Silicon Valley essentially has two complementary elements. One is all about dreams so unlikely that they beggar belief: the idea that the Tesla CEO Elon Musk will one day set up a colony on Mars or that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg can successfully marshal an attempt to “cure, prevent and manage” all diseases in a single generation. Whatever its basis in fact, this stuff casts people and corporations as godlike visionaries, and then provides a puffed-up context for the stuff the big tech companies shout about week in, week out: stuff we either don’t need or, worse, which threatens some of the basic aspects of everyday\u0026nbspcivilisation.Our phones are full of apps that gather digital dust, and the same fate has befallen many supposedly groundbreaking inventions. Though the idea of internet-enabled spectacles has potentially fascinating uses in such fields as autism, education and high-end manufacturing, Google Glass was never going to be a mass-market product in the way its inventors thought.Yet some people fall in love with these things. Among the great mountain of writing at the heart of the current so-called “techlash” is a great book entitled Radical Technologies, by the former tech insider Adam Greenfield. When he writes about people obsessed with the kind of internet-enabled devices that monitor sleep, heart rates and exercise levels, he nails something that applies to a whole array of allegedly cutting-edge innovations. “A not-insignificant percentage of the population has so decisively internalised the values of the market for their labour,” he writes, “that the act of resculpting themselves to better meet its needs feels like authentic expression.” What he says echoes a key passage in Guy Debord’s visionary text The Society of the Spectacle, published 50 years ago: “Just when the mass of commodities slides toward puerility, the puerile itself becomes a special commodity this is epitomised by the gadget … The only use which remains here is the fundamental use of submission.”Such ornate words speak an enduring truth. Amazing and sometimes life-enhancing innovations, I dare say, are being worked on by tech geniuses across the world. In fields such as driverless transport, virtual reality and blockchain technology, new inventions may eventually transform our lives, and fulfil the cliched big-tech promise about making the world a better place. But that is the not the nature of our current phase of history, nor the absurd and often dangerous creations we are now being offered on an almost monthly basis.Ignore all those whoops. If we do not want to live in a world in which “assistants” trick us into flimsy conversations, and human contact is a chore left to the bottom of the labour market, we do not have to. There is a basic fact about the future the figureheads of big tech too often forget: that what it will look like is actually up to us, not them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d57029ae6309f1441a44545d0c25ef186a2e4f/0_207_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b22d43ae43a03d3a00cdd0ffcb2de2c","title":"labour voters back remain lewisham east soft brexit","story":"There are lessons from the Lewisham East selection process. For all the arguments and jockeying, the soft Brexit candidate wonLewisham East, for which Labour has just chosen its prospective parliamentary candidate, is a erse south London constituency of quite widespread deprivation, yet also has some giant houses and rich people. It is the scene of generative and committed community organising – against the necessity for food banks, against the closure of its hospital – and some trenchant and passionate activists in both its constituency Labour party and Momentum branches. “Trenchant and passionate” sounds like a euphemism for infighting, and sometimes it is.The Momentum meeting last month to elect its new committee was so fraught that half the room walked out and reconvened in the pub. Yet this is what local politics should look like, if it’s to mean anything: there will be battles people will not always agree not everything will be solved by persuasion it’s in the DNA of activism that some people will be very annoying. Local groups are kept alive by debate, and wither when they bury their isions and argue instead about who is the most loyal, or realistic.It is a cliche of the age that “real” Labour politics happens or should happen in its “heartlands”. When people refer these days to heartlands, what they invariably mean is defined as an area that’s been left behind, and the signature of the left-behind is that they’re not interested in politics. This is a rhetorical\u0026nbspmanoeuvre to maintain the authority of the status quo-ists: if authentic politics resides with the unengaged and the unheard, everything they think must be mediated through an MP or commentator who has somehow ined their true hearts. People who turn up to Momentum meetings and fight to the death for the appointment of its disabilities rep aren’t “real” people and therefore don’t need to be heard. Lewisham East is as true a Labour heartland as any seat in the country. Its residents are only an elite if you consider proximity to the National Maritime Museum a more important metric than median household income.Lewisham East is a seat in south-east London, where areas of affluence sit alongside pockets of social deprivation. The urban centres of Catford, Blackheath, Lee and Grove Park fall within the constituency. It has been held by Labour since 1992 when Bridget Prentice was elected. In the last local elections the wards inside the leafy constituency returned 21 Labour councillors. Membership to the Labour party has shot up in Lewisham from 1,200 after the 2015 general election to just under 1,700.\u0026nbspIt was, as Novara Media’s Aaron Bastani noted, inspiring to see the shortlist consisting entirely of black, Asian and minority-ethnic women: Janet Daby, who eventually won Sakina Sheikh, who became known as “the Momentum candidate” Claudia Webbe, a member of the Labour national executive committee, and the Unite choice and Brenda Dacres, who withdrew for health reasons and threw her support behind Daby. Broadly, both Daby and Dacres were known as the “centrist” or “Labour right” candidates – these terms are so vexed and indefinable that it’s simpler to know them as non-Corbynites except that, as a member, Daby voted for Corbyn in both leadership elections. So she is a Corbynite, but not a proper one, according to some rules that I’m afraid I don’t know.Reports claimed that a last-minute manoeuvre could have resulted in Sheikh’s removal from the shortlist, for her role with the Take Back the City (TBTC) campaign, a grassroots movement about housing, wages and affordability in London, which once fielded some candidates against Labour in some distant London Assembly election. To a political insider, this would have been just the way things work: if factions are competing for the same votes, and one side can get the other on a technicality, fair’s fair. To an outsider, it was ludicrous and outrageous: Sheikh’s involvement with TBTC was minimal anyway (she chaired a hustings for them, and wasn’t a member) if a prospective candidate isn’t allowed a history of cooperation with other grassroots organisations of similar outlook, then not just the Labour party but also the entire dream of a reinvigorated democracy is completely sunk.Somebody, somewhere, obviously agreed with that, since Sheikh was back on the ballot by the time of the hustings and would – for what it’s worth, which is not very much, as I’m not a Lewisham member – have had my vote. Except for one small thing she vowed (granted, on Twitter, never a very solid vow-platform) never to defy the party whip on Brexit, because south Londoners “don’t have strops, they make history”. It is a peculiar and faintly nasty Brexiteer frame, to characterise dissent as childish and silly, and obedience as epoch-making. If you opposed Brexit, the obvious candidate to vote for would be the most remain-leaning: Daby.And the wider lesson from all of this? In volatile and, more to the point, opaque times, when every election has a subtext and every stage has its behind-the-scenes, a victory can and will be claimed by anyone with the chutzpah. Yet I don’t think it’s unreasonable to submit, on the basis of Daby’s support for both the single market and the customs union, and the cheers she got at the hustings when she very clearly said so, that hers is a victory for remain furthermore, that remain is still, for all of Corbyn’s strategic ambiguity on the matter, the overwhelming preference of Labour voters.It’s not a victory for the Labour “centre”. Only Daby’s opponents ever defined her against the party’s left. It’s not a vote against Momentum, or against Unite, whatever the highs and lows of their campaigning. It was a vote – and a pretty conclusive one – in favour of the views Daby openly expressed. And what might this mean in terms of the debate? Never let a complex backstory blind you to the bleedin’ obvious. And then, perhaps, act on what you’ve \u0026nbsplearned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d807083812632f1ba13db0c73362c5ad98aa399/0_0_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2374168f524ff4fd10e4dc612a4c11e2","title":"how we made the blair witch project","story":"‘We were listed as deceased on IMDb. Our parents started getting condolence calls’I grew up around the woods and swamps of Florida. For a long time, I had this idea of seeing a stick figure hanging from a tree and it creeped the hell out of me. Ed Sánchez, a friend from university who ended up co-directing, helped me work this into a 35-page treatment about three students who go missing after heading out into the Maryland woods to make a documentary about a legendary witch. The idea was that this film was put together later, using the footage they shot. In the late 90s, with digital coming into its own, it was only a matter of time before someone made this kind of first-person movie.The treatment covered what happens, but it had no dialogue – we wanted it all improvised. The original plan was for it to be three guys, but we had to cast Heather Donahue after what happened during her audition. We asked actors to pretend to be at a parole hearing and explain why they should be released. She said: “I probably shouldn’t be released.”We set up a base at a house in Germantown, Maryland, that Ed shared with his girlfriend. There were 10 to 15 of us there for six weeks, sleeping on couches and on the floor. The shoot took eight days and was a 247 operation. It wasn’t like a normal film: the actors would work the cameras, filming each other all the time. Using GPS, we directed them to locations marked with flags or milk crates, where they’d leave their footage and pick up food and our directing notes. These would say things like: “Heather, you’re absolutely sure that to get out of this mess you go south. Don’t take no for an answer.” Or: “Josh, somewhere along the way today, you’ve had it with this bullshit.” They had the freedom to decide how to play it: we only intervened if we felt they needed to tone things down. Then there were the “gags” we’d pull at night that they had to react to – like hearing the children’s voices, or feeling the tent being shaken.All in, it cost about $300,000 – and it made nearly $250m worldwide. Not too many movies have had such a cultural influence. It popularised the found-footage approach, for better or for worse. There’s a common misunderstanding that not a lot went into it, but it took two years of effort to make it look like it was just shot by three students over a long weekend.Heather’s parents were worried Ed and Dan might be taking her out into the woods to make a snuff movie. I was up for any kind of adventure back then, so said yes when the two of them asked me to play the cameraman. Tensions got high, we got hungry, we got uncomfortable and we hurt each other’s feelings. So we came up with a safe word for whenever we had to break character and remind ourselves this was just a job: taco. We regretted that by about day three. It just kept reminding us how hungry we were.At the time, I felt bad about my final attack on Heather – when I turn the camera on her and yell at her about what her motivation is. It was me, expressing frustration as both a character and an actor, but it worked on another level: the idea of us all as performers. The film was inadvertently prescient about the idea of 15 minutes of fame. The fear level on the night-time interventions wasn’t actually that high. Your body would have finally warmed up the sleeping bag enough for you to fall asleep, then you’d hear baby noises outside. It was more annoying than anything else: we’ve got to act now. My character got killed first, so I took a really long shower, got stoned and went to Denny’s.We went from total anonymity to the cover of Newsweek in a very short time. Artisan played the real-life disappearance angle as much as possible. We were specifically not invited to the Cannes premiere and, for a while, were listed as deceased on IMDb.

Saturday’s contest in Kiev will be Real’s fourth Champions League final in five years, with Zinedine Zidane’s holders aiming to lift the trophy for a third consecutive season. No club has won a hat-trick of European Cups since Bayern Munich in 1974, 75 and 76.Liverpool’s recent European record pales by comparison but having reached a first final in 11 years with several exhilarating performances and scored a competition record 40 goals en route, their manager is confident his team’s virtues can prove decisive in Ukraine.Klopp refused to be drawn on whether Real should be favourites but said: “They are more experienced, that is a fact. If there is a market for experience they should sell it because then they would be even richer. Experience is very important in life but it is not the only thing. It is important to be more experienced but you can level it with desire, attitude, work-rate and that is what I love in football. We made our own experience.“We are not as long together as Real Madrid because they play these finals pretty much with the same team so as a group they are very strong. That is all fact, but it is still football and we have a chance and let’s give it a try. Let’s go there and try to perform on a level which maybe people would say is not possible for us but it is possible.”Klopp added: “We did all the things we need to do plenty of times already in the Champions League campaign and now we need to do it again. Real Madrid is a really good football team but we are a really good football team. We are full of desire and we really work for our dreams.”The Liverpool manager expects his team to play without fear against Real having thrived on the pressure of reaching the final and next season’s Champions League on the last day of the Premier League season with an injury-hit squad. He also cited brave attacking displays against Manchester City and Roma in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively as reason to approach Kiev with optimism.Klopp added: “We had a lot of pressure and a lot of expectations in the last few weeks. Each game we drew we wanted to win. I said all that rubbish after West Bromwich Albion only because I was really angry we didn’t win. I am not a psychologist but if somebody would tell me constantly that everything is different in the next game then I would get nervous.“We have to handle it like an opportunity because it is an opportunity. You cannot go into a football game knowing you can lose it. I experienced that plenty of times but I am still a happy person. Life goes on. We will show the players why it makes so much sense to be brave. It was not easy to be brave against Manchester City and against Roma but we did it. The moment we tried to defend the result we were almost out. I am in a good mood. I am really looking forward to the game. Unlike the Brighton one, I would buy a 1-0. This game I really want to play.”Long-term absentees Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joël Matip were the only senior players missing from training on Monday as Liverpool stepped up preparations for Kiev while Emre Can, along with Adam Lallana, significantly increases Klopp’s midfield options for the final.“The mood is very good for the club, for us and for the boys because we finished the season in the best way,” said the manager.“ We felt really good and then having time to prepare for the game is really good. We could do a lot of things and didn’t have to compress it into two or three sessions.“We could do a lot of things in training. We have three more sessions and then we will be best prepared for the game. We feel good and think we deserve to be where we are because the boys showed up in the campaign.“It was very exciting and now we want to bring it to the best possible end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7552d574e708864f9b0a798e603c7b61072cf42/1125_121_2429_1457/master/2429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a27e4148470a9a65b472a6e0f3a148c0","title":"manuel pellegrini set to be confirmed as west ham new manager","story":"• Chilean agrees three-year deal after talks with David Sullivan• Pellegrini will be given full control of transfers at London clubManuel Pellegrini is set to be announced as West Ham United’s new manager after holding talks with the club’s co-owner David Sullivan in London on Monday.Pellegrini has agreed a three-year deal worth £10m a year with West Ham, who parted company with David Moyes last week, and it is understood that the Chilean will be given full control of transfers by Sullivan, who had announced his intention to appoint a “high-calibre” appointment after the departure of Moyes, who walked away after the club openly began speaking to other candidates for his job.

One was cooked in my sister’s front yard in the LA sunshine the other in my British back garden, hurriedly, before the dark clouds descended. Both were unreasonably delicious and are now firmly on my summer lineup. I’ve edged the barbecue closer to the back door so we needn’t even wait for the sun.This is my take on Greek feta bouyiourdi, although I char my peppers first as it doubles the smoky hum. I use the pale yellow-green Turkish peppers: they are long and thin, sweeter and milder than their green pepper cousins, but, if you can’t find them, don’t worry. This is best done on the barbecue, but you can also char the peppers over a naked gas flame, then cook the parcels in the oven.2 fresh Turkish peppers or 1 green pepper1 x 200g block feta, cut into 5 slices1 handful cherry tomatoes, halved (I used different coloured ones)1 tsp coriander seed, bashed in a mortar1 pinch of dried oreganoOlive oilLight the barbecue. Once hot and still roaring, cook the peppers directly on the flame until they are blackened all over. Take off the heat and, once cool, peel away most of the black skin and cut the flesh into slices, discarding the stems and seeds.Put the feta slices on a piece of foil large enough to wrap around them. Top the cheese with the tomatoes, peppers, coriander, oregano and a drizzle of olive oil. Seal the foil at the top to make a little parcel.Once the barbecue flames have died down and the coals are white, put the packet on to them and cook for 10-15 minutes (you could also do this in an oven at 220C425Fgas 7).It’s ready when each slice of feta is soft, the peppers cooked-through and the tomatoes sticky and roasted.This is the kind of salad around which to build a meal: yoghurt, greens, charred carrots and fennel generously spiced and with a little sweet and sour.

No need to peel. Fill a large pot with generously salted boiling water and blanch the carrots for seven to 12 minutes (depending on size), until they are cooked through but still holding their shape.Meanwhile, slice the fennel into thin wedges across the root and toss with the cumin, fennel seeds, turmeric, maple syrup, vinegar and olive oil and seasoning in a baking tray. Drain the carrots and add them, tossing again. Leave to sit for at least 30 minutes – ideally for a few hours or overnight.When you are ready to cook, heat the barbecue or griddle pan. If you are using a barbecue, cook the carrots and fennel slices on once the flames have died down but the coals are still red hot. Turn from time to time, until they are charred all over and soft throughout.Meanwhile, mix the yoghurt with a few tablespoons of the remaining marinade and a good pinch each of salt and pepper. Spread the yoghurt over the bottom of a plate, toss the leaves in any remaining marinade and scatter them over the yoghurt.

Annilese Miskimmon’s staging of Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, first seen during the 2016 tour, is new to the main festival. Richard Jones’s production of Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier premiered in 2014. Both ided opinion when new, and both are essentially anti-Romantic in stance, stripping away the veneer of sentimentality that each work has accumulated over time.Miskimmon’s Butterfly is more a reworking than a straight revival, though the basic concept remains the same. She updates the opera to the closing years of the American occupation of Japan, and places the narrative in the wider context of an exploitative system that offers local girls the possibility of escaping poverty by becoming GI brides and allows US servicemen to take advantage of conveniently dissolvable marriages. Two years ago, Miskimmon’s anger rode roughshod over the opera’s humanity, resulting in a hardness of edge that sat uneasily with the score’s emotive force. This time round, greater subtlety of detail combined with striking performances allows the drama fully to hit home.Butterfly is played by the Moldovan soprano Olga Busuioc, whose exceptional way with dynamics and tone colour allows her to encompass both the naivety of the opening scenes and the tragic emotions of the later acts. We can completely understand her attraction to Joshua Guerrero’s handsome if weak-willed Pinkerton, and there’s a real sense of rapture in their love duet. But we also notice the telling streak of pride that lurks beneath her vulnerability in the way she loftily dismisses Simon Mechliński’s Yamadori and rounds on Elizabeth DeShong’s fiercely devoted Suzuki. Omer Meir Wellber’s conducting, meanwhile, has a tremendous, slow-burning intensity that draws us relentlessly into the opera’s unsettling world.Musically, Der Rosenkavalier is equally strong for the most part, although conductor Robin Ticciati got off to an awkward start on opening night with an uncharacteristically lacklustre account of the prelude. Rachel Willis-Sørensen is the outstanding Marschallin, sumptuous of tone, witty yet sad. Kate Lindsey makes a comparably fine Octavian, and is gauche, funny, extremely touching in moments of bewilderment. Elizabeth Sutphen’s Sophie sounds exquisite, while Brindley Sherratt’s Ochs combines louche charm with genuine menace.Jones’s staging, however, is by turns admirable and perplexing. As one might expect, he is strong on the class isions that underpin the opera, sharply differentiating between a declining aristocracy, an emerging bourgeoisie and an urban proletariat on the make. His treatment of the protagonists has great clarity. Ochs’s humiliation of Sophie in act two has rarely felt more uncomfortable, and time really seems to stand still in the Presentation of the Rose and the final Trio. Against that, however, must be set a quirkiness that sometimes gets in the way. The designs, surreally jumbling periods from the 18th century to the 1970s, sit uneasily with an opera that is essentially a realistic comedy of manners. The Marschallin muses on her past as a psychoanalytic patient on Freud’s couch, which strikes an awkward note. And there are moments when parades of servants and flunkies, endlessly shifting furniture, prove intrusive. It doesn’t quite add up to a theatrically satisfying whole, though it is unquestionably beautiful to listen to.• At Glyndebourne until 26 June (Der Rosenkavalier) and 18 July (Madama Butterfly).

In a full-throttle 100-minute set at Kings Place, Wollny and his trio with Swiss double bassist Christian Weber and the implacably dynamic Berlin jazz, rock and hardcore punk drummer Eric Schaefer rattled through fitfully delicate but more often explosive improvisations on much of the material from this year’s Oslo and Wartburg albums – works by Hindemith, Debussy, Scott Walker, and the trio’s own originals mingle on those recordings’ typically sweeping takes on modern music.The gig’s compelling virtue was exactly that explosiveness, a product of Wollny’s formidable jazzclassical virtuosity, coupled with an appetite in performance for throwing everything he’s learned and knows to the wind. The trio opened with a Schaefer original that began in abstract arco-bass murmurs, shuffling brushwork and clipped treble-piano wriggles before embracing a tender chordal melody, a swerving uptempo jazz groove, and a stretch of warlike rock-drums pounding. Scott Walker’s Big Louise and Paul Hindemith’s Ludus Tonalis were prodded and unpicked in blues figures, quiet pizzicato bass variations, and polyrhythms veering across postbop and funk. Debussy’s Nuits Blanches and German saxophonist (and former Wollny employer) Heinz Sauer’s Roses Are Black segued as captivatingly slow chord-melodies against busy drumming, ecstatic rock crescendos reminiscent of the late and much-missed EST, and bursts of sleek uptempo avant-swing that highlighted the leader’s audacity of improv phrasing at any speed. Late in the set, Schaefer’s subtlety with delicately ringing small sounds and Wollny’s soft-stroked lyricism had a seductiveness that could have been valuably prolonged, but the latter’s unaccompanied blur of frenziedly skipping countermelodies and boogieing free-improv on the encore was a thrilling tour de force. A shade too much of this powerful set wound up in chord-hammering, percussion-storming finales, but it was, nonetheless, a spectacular display of formidable improv skill hitched to sweeping knowledge of contemporary music.

An improved solution to the Operation Stack management plan had been sought, with hauliers having warned that customs checks in the event of a hard Brexit could cause long queues at Channel ports.In a written ministerial statement, which makes no mention of Brexit, the transport minister Jesse Norman said: “The department has now agreed with Highways England that this arrangement should take the form of a contraflow system which would see lorries for the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel held on the coast-bound carriageway between junctions eight and nine of the M20, while other traffic will use a contraflow to continue their journey on the other side of the motorway.”He said Highways England was starting preparatory works for the scheme, which would be available from early 2019. The government would also launch a consultation to seek views on other potential overnight lorry parks for up to 1,500 vehicles, Norman said.Labour said the latest “empty announcement” was a further part of the government’s “incompetent and disastrous” handling of the problem, which included a new £250m parking area being rejected by planners and millions being spent renting space at Manston airport.The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “The scale of Chris Grayling’s dithering and delaying since Operation Stack in 2015 is breathtaking. A no deal Brexit could grind the south-east of England to a halt, but Grayling is simply asleep at the wheel.”The Freight Transport Association said the proposedsolution was a good compromise until permanent parks could be provided. Christopher Snelling, the FTA’s head of UK policy, said: “It is vital both for the logistics industry and for Kent as a whole that traffic can continue to flow freely throughout the county, and the proposed solution could provide that for now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab8d36f9ac4e0fdbdf3381fdce86642c00820141/0_99_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f46fae5067bb8ef6aba0c992b4ff3cd7","title":"russian activity city of london faces further scrutiny mps","story":"Second select committee to examine issue as UK law firm criticised for advising oligarchA second select committee of MPs is expected to examine how Russian companies use the City of London after the foreign affairs committee singled out the corporate law firm Linklaters for its role in advising on last year’s flotation of Oleg Deripaska’s En+.Parliamentary sources indicated that the Treasury select committee would take up the subject as part of its inquiry into economic crime and that Linklaters could again be asked to appear, potentially creating a confrontation with a law firm that has so far refused to give evidence.Linklaters turned down more than one request to explain its involvement as the principal lawyers in the £5bn flotation of En+ in November 2017, which has become controversial as Anglo-Russian relations have deteriorated and Deripaska was placed on a US economic sanctions list.The foreign affairs select committee said of Linklaters: “We regret their unwillingness to engage with our inquiry and must leave others to judge whether their work ‘at the forefront of financial, corporate and commercial developments in Russia’ has left them so entwined in the corruption of the Kremlin and its supporters that they are no longer able to meet the standards expected of a UK-regulated law firm.”Linklaters did not explain why it had not wanted to give evidence but released a statement saying it was “surprised and concerned at the passing criticism” contained in the MPs’ report. “We reject any suggestion based solely on the fact that we – like dozens of other international firms – operate in a particular market that our services may somehow involve the firm in corruption, state-related or otherwise.”Linklaters shared $35m (£25m) in fees from the lucrative float with US law firm White \u0026amp Case as well as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan. Typically, lawyers tend to share about half of the total pot of fees.Senior backbench MPs are coordinating their inquiries into Russia and have set up a steering group designed to ensure that select committees do not overlap. It is chaired by Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, and includes Nicky Morgan’s Treasury committee, as well as the digital, culture, media and sport committee which is inquiring into fake news.The foreign affairs committee complained that the successful listing of En+ and sales of Russian sovereign debt in London sent out a mixed message that was “encouraging President Putin and his associates” to conclude that their money “is safe and welcome in London”. But shares in the company tumbled after the US placed Deripaska on a sanctions blacklist in April.

However, some in Westminster believe that if Brussels accepts the UK’s alternative plan, which would retain key aspects of the customs union if a solution to the Irish border problem has not been found, it could become the post-Brexit norm. A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.In a speech in Macclesfield on Monday, May said: “What we’re proposing is an alternative backstop proposal, but nobody wants this to be the solution that is achieved. “We want to achieve the right solution through our overall relationship with the European Union. If it is necessary, it will be in a very limited set of circumstances for a limited time. But we are working on achieving that commitment to Northern Ireland through our overall relationship with the European Union.”The cabinet remains deadlocked over the final customs arrangement Britain that should pursue and HMRC officials believe neither model under consideration will be ready to implement the end of the transition period in December 2020.It remains unclear whether the EU27 will accept the government’s version of the backstop plan, which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs to imports but leave it free to strike new trade deals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0388dc305afc887a64e7643c77aa952048c0ddf0/0_200_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e43b01f9877bf342afaea4cbf953e79","title":"scientists find secret behind sweet sound of stradivarius violins","story":"The instruments achieve their sweetness and brilliance by mimicking aspects of the human voice, study saysThe violins made by the Italian masters Andrea Amati and Antonio Straari are celebrated as the finest ever made, but the secret behind their perfect sound has mystified experts for centuries.Now scientists in Taiwan believe they have hit on an answer. Using software normally reserved for speech analysis, they found that violins from the two Cremonese luthiers mimic aspects of the human voice, a feature they argue adds to the instruments’ exceptional musical quality.The scientists recorded a professional violinist playing 15 antique instruments at Taiwan’s Chimei Museum and compared the acoustic signatures with those from 16 male and female vocalists who were recorded singing English vowel sounds.The researchers found that the early Italian instruments produced human-like “formants”, the harmonic tones that correspond to resonances in the vocal tract. Specifically, the Amati violins produced formants similar to those from bass and baritone singers, while the Straari instruments had higher-frequency formants, closer to those of tenors and contraltos.Hwan-Ching Tai, an author on the study at the National Taiwan University, said Straari violins are often described as having “brightness” and “brilliance”, both qualities that could be rooted in the higher-frequency tones that make the instruments sound closer to female voices.“Some Straari violins clearly possess female singing qualities, which may contribute to their perceived sweetness and brilliance,” he said. Female singers tend to have higher-frequency formants than males because their vocal tracts are shorter.Born in 1505, Andrea Amati is credited with inventing the modern violin. His instruments were so successful that the designs were copied for generations. Antonio Straari, who was born 139 years later, inherited Amati’s methods and designs and improved on them until he was manufacturing instruments now widely considered to be unsurpassed.Tai and his colleagues decided to compare the acoustic features of antique violins with those from singers after reading a quote from Francesco Geminiani, a famous baroque composer and author of The Art of Playing on the Violin, one of the most influential violin manuals ever published. Writing in the 1751 book, Geminiani described the secret of violin performance as “giving the instrument a tone that shall in a manner rival the most perfect human voice”.Tai suspects the uncanny resemblance between early Italian violins and human voices is not an accident. “The early violin was not a solo instrument but an accompaniment to songs and dances,” he said. “It is conceivable that Andrea Amati may have wanted to build a string instrument that could imitate human voices to blend into such music.” Tai, whose work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, is not the first scientist to search for a theory of the Italian masters’ success. Other researchers have claimed that the secret lies in the varnish, or in the density of the wood, even as others have shown that concert audiences actually prefer the sound of modern violins.Christian Lloyd, managing editor of the Strad magazine, said violinists often talk about their instruments with words typically used to describe voices. “People talk about their violins being lively, sweet or mellow,” he said. “If they don’t like the sound, they’ll say it’s metallic, tinny or steely. The worst thing you can call an instrument is dead.”In the past, Lloyd said, violin makers kept their manufacturing methods close to their chests, so secrets, whether important or not, were part of the business. But today, manufacturers are far more open and share details of their designs and methods. As a result, he said, the best instruments made today are on a par with Straari’s.For the latest study, Tai looked only at antique violins, raising the question of how modern violins would have fared in comparison. “Who’s to say the modern instruments won’t give you the same qualities?” Lloyd said. “We don’t think there are secrets of the Straarius.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8942a80dcc587662d8373192b3ae4fcda2a348b0/0_200_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6695ca8ede8f4d682adc131f4551da6c","title":"danny cipriani england comeback full back","story":"Danny Cipriani could make his first England appearance under Eddie Jones in the No\u0026nbsp15 jersey after he was named among the full-backs in the squad to face the Barbarians on Sunday. Nathan Hughes will also get the chance to stake a claim for the South Africa tour after he and Cipriani were among six losing Premiership semi-finalists selected in Jones’s 35-man squad.Cipriani won his last England cap in a 2015 World Cup warmup match with an eye-catching cameo against France from full-back and it is a position he often played in his first spell with Wasps. Jones said when he named Cipriani in the touring party as an inside back that “I’ve seen him play 15 well as a younger guy and there’s no reason he couldn’t do that now”, and his selection among the full-backs for Sunday’s match suggests Jones will try him there at some point against the invitational side.Hughes, meanwhile, came through 66 minutes against Saracens on Saturday in his first appearance since sustaining a knee injury during the Six Nations. He was not selected in the 34-man squad to tour South Africa earlier this month but has the chance to prove his fitness to Jones this week and he may benefit from the absence of his 21-year-old Wasps team-mate Jack Willis, who was originally due to go to South Africa before suffering a nasty-looking knee injury on Saturday. Willis’s omission from Monday’ssquad only adds to the likelihood he will miss the tour and with continued question marks over the fitness of Billy Vunipola, Hughes’s hopes of a late call-up to face the Springboks would appear to be strengthened.Elliot Daly and Joe Launchbury are also among the losing semi-finalists added to the squad but will not arrive until Wednesday and Thursday respectively, suggesting they are unlikely to be involved on Sunday. Hughes is due arrive in camp on Tuesday.Marcus Smith is also part of the 35-man group, having also been named on Monday in England’s squad for the World Under-20 Championship which begins in France at the end of the month. The Harlequins fly-half, who is not due to tour South Africa, is among the standout names in the junior squad along with Ben Curry, Ben Loader and Gabriel Ibitoye, who like Smith has been previously called into the senior squad as an apprentice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b81036924ca99c15509fbf6fcb6a52f2a880779/364_0_2877_1727/master/2877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fffdae8c0c8d632d1f22251358e7e15","title":"jos buttler trust instincts england pakistan first test lords","story":"Jos Buttler has admitted he is a luxury in England’s re-fitted Test team and that his return will ide opinion. But as the side’s most potent white-ball weapon prepares for a third stab at the longest format, he says the plan this time is to play on instinct.How Buttler fares in the series with Pakistan that starts at Lord’s on Thursday will make one of the most intriguing subplots during the early Test summer as Joe Root’s side look to return to winning ways after their winter of discontent.Can such a talent, fresh from wreaking havoc as an opener in the Indian Premier League but someone who has not faced a red Dukes ball since the end of last season with Lancashire, really come off as a specialist game changer at No 7?Though not entirely new territory, given the last three of his 18 caps came in the same role during the 2016 tour of India, the 27-year-old is planning a fresh mindset as he looks to repay a significant show of faith from the new national selector, Ed Smith, and Root.“It is a luxury role for a side to have,” said Buttler, before his first training session back. “For me it is about trusting instincts and not fighting them. In the past I have potentially felt as if I had to play in a certain way or be something I am not. So as much as I can I will be trusting my instincts. That is going to be the best way to be successful.”His regret refers chiefly to the 2015 Ashes when, having registered half-centuries in five of his first eight Tests, Buttler went into his shell and appeared to lose the location of his off stump. Two matches into the following winter in United Arab Emirates and he was forced to hand over the wicketkeeping gloves to Jonny Bairstow.Buttler said: “I have learned a lot about myself over the past two years. If you are going to fail, fail in a genuine way and not someone else’s way. It’s going to be a challenge but from the conversations I’ve had with Joe and Ed Smith, it’s very much they want me to play the way that suits me and in the fashion they believe will get the best out of me.”His recall is one in which his perceived ability has trumped his form in this format. Indeed, Buttler was himself surprised when, while waiting for a match between his Rajasthan Royals side and Kolkata Knightriders, and with a record-equalling run of five successive IPL half-centuries behind him, he got the call.So with just four first-class centuries to his name – the last of which came four years ago when newly transferred from Taunton to Old Trafford – and an exclusive diet of white-ball cricket this year, Buttler accepts that some of the county batsmen who had hoped to force their way into the Test team may feel aggrieved.Buttler said: “I’m very aware that I’m the beneficiary of opinions. I don’t know whether there’s a right or wrong. Everyone has an opinion. That’s why sport is so interesting. I’ve been afforded an amazing opportunity to come and play and one that I’m excited about. I am accepting of the noise around it. That’s outside my control.“It shows that people are very open-minded and there’s not only one way in to national selection. If anything that should benefit guys as you can do things your way. Whatever opportunities are afforded to you, you shouldn’t be worried about taking them for risk of saying: ‘If I go and play in a tournament somewhere that’s my red-ball ambitions finished.’”As Root’s side ready themselves for Pakistan, one such tournament is a hot topic of discussion, with the Test players present at Lord’s being briefed in small groups on the England and Wales Cricket Board’s latest thinking regarding The Hundred.Reaction around the county squads has been lukewarm but the hope is that by getting the international cricketers on board – via presentations from the tournament director, Sanjay Patel, and its architect, Mike Fordham – some positivity may trickle down.Asked for his take on the new 100-ball concept, Buttler replied: “People don’t necessarily accept change readily. I’m sure in 2003, when Twenty20 was introduced, it was seen as such a radical move. Gradually, it’s been accepted and has done really well.“There are some fantastic ideas behind The Hundred and what it’s trying to achieve. If it can fulfil those ambitions then it’s going to be great for cricket. If it’s got the best players around the world and the best players in England, I’m sure it’s going to be successful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

I took pictures of nothing and everything surrounding these centenarians from the Montérégie region in Québec, Canada. But one thing kept occurring: every single woman I photographed wanted to groom herself to make sure she would look good in my pictures. This is how it became a story about beauty.I became interested in the efforts that these women put (or didn’t put) into looking beautiful, and the challenges that they face in their old age. I asked them about youth, ageing, feminism, sexuality, charm, appearance, love, and I documented their beauty rituals. Visiting Marie-Berthe Paquette, the woman in the first photograph, was an unbelievable spectacle. She likes to be the center of attention and is willing to do just about everything to make her audience burst out laughing. Every time I visited her, she told me funny stories, sang and danced. In her portrait, she is dancing in a sexy and provocative way for the sake of her audience (myself and two family members). “I personally find myself beautiful, and when I don’t, I do my best anyways! I like to have my hair neatly styled and wear dresses, jewelry and other accessories. I’ve always paid attention to my appearance. In fact, I’m known as la frache (the trendy lady).” Marie-Berthe Paquette, 105 years old, in Montréal, Québec.“I actually care more about beauty today than when I was young. I like to dress rather well, in pretty, simple and practical dresses. I put on foundation and perfume in the morning, lipstick after each meal, and I go to the hairdresser’s every week. I’m also careful not to eat foods that are either too rich or too sweet. It’s important to not let oneself go. I used to enjoy wearing necklaces, but I can no longer attach them, so I gave up.” Solange Racine, 101 years old, in Granby, Québec.To me, the third photo (below) is particularly touching. Laure Saucier, the centenarian in the picture, was very sick and weak but also very peaceful and serene. She didn’t have the energy to move or talk, and even though she used to be a very stylish woman, I doubt she cared about the way she looked any more. But even though Saucier seemed distanced from the physical world, her daughter, Lise Provost, continued to make sure that her mother looked good: that her nails and hair were done and she had jewelry and lipstick on. She knew this used to be important to her mother and wanted to honor her. Since they couldn’t communicate verbally any more, these rituals were their way to stay close together.Through these portraits, shot in 2016, I want to question society’s obsession with youth and beauty standards, and to give a voice to these women whose beauty is rarely acknowledged.“She was very stylish and competitive. She was in love with my father and I think she worried about not being good enough. She always wore lipstick, blush, high heels, earrings, perfume and curled her hair. She’d rub baby oil on herself and bought Madame Avon’s rejuvenating creams. In the evening she went to bed with cotton strips wrapped under her chin and fastened on the top of her head, hoping to lift and tauten her chin and cheeks.” Lise Provost (right) talking about her mother, Laure Saucier (left), in Acton Vale, Québec. Saucier passed away in 2016 at 101 years old.“I definitely find myself as ugly. Beauty fades as we get older. Our noses and ears get bigger, our gait changes, we get hunched backs. Some are worse off than me, but I’m not beautiful at all. Still, I enjoy life and I look forward to the future, even if it’s a short one when you’re 100 years old.” Jeannette Ballard, 100 years old, in Granby, Québec.“When I was young I had long hair, nice legs and curves. Young ladies today all strive to be skinny, but I think that real beauty is natural beauty. We are who we are, and that’s all that matters.” Anne-Marie Pronovost, 100 years old, in Sutton, Québec. Pronovost died in 2017.“The word beauty invokes great classic French authors, and music. When I was young, I always had my nose in a book and I wrote. I don’t mean to brag, but people envied my writing skills. I like Mozart a lot, but it’s Beethoven who really makes my heart sing.” Madeleine Beaugrand Champagneage, 102 years old, in St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Québec. Beaugrand Champagneage passed away in 2017.“Even though we constantly told her that she was beautiful, my mom had always found herself ugly. She often said that she had a monkey face and that she didn’t like her plumpness. My mother regularly dieted. There were stretches where we went without potatoes, bread or desserts. She also tried different weight loss pills. She wore girdles and corsets that she’d buy at Mrs Dinovitzer’s store. I think her weight had always been her biggest fixation.” Provost talking about her mother, Saucier.“When I was young, like all women, I wanted to be attractive. I curled my hair, wore the beautiful outfits my mom made for me and suffered in high heels. Still, I never wore makeup I felt like it was fake. I married my husband because he was handsome, which I ended up regretting. He wasn’t a very good partner and I ended up kicking him out. Rather than maintaining physical beauty, which is vain, I advise young women to cultivate the beauty that surrounds them. You can tend a garden, draw, play music, etc. It’s important to be kind, independent and constantly educate yourself. ” Beaugrand Champagne.“As a young lady, I could not afford to be frivolous. We were poor and had to work all the time. We had to take part in day-to-day chores, pick the raspberries, take care of the babies, cook, help with the harvest, do housework and bathe the children … and all of that without electricity. We didn’t have time to think about beauty.” Solange Racine, 101 years old, in Granby, Québec.“My husband was a very good-looking man. He had beautiful curly hair, and was nicknamed ‘Willy la coche’ (Willy the good-looker). It was very important for him to be always well dressed. When he went out to work at the lumber camp, he’d sell his suit and buy a brand new one when he returned. On the other hand, he was a flirt and a bit fickle: he loved all women and drank too much. But it’s important to be able to forgive.” Anne-Marie Pronovost, 100 years old, in Sutton, Québec.“Of course I’d rather be good-looking rather than ugly! But back when I was young, I couldn’t be bothered with beauty. It was vanity. It was a sin. What really mattered was the family, putting food on the table and making sure that the children were bathed and clothed. I am blessed because my daughter is the one now taking care of me. She welcomed me in her home 20 years ago and I am still there. Family is all that really matters.” Isabelle Gagn (left), 103 years old, in Clermont, Québec, with her daughter (right).“I’m a very rational and level-headed person, and I’m not very sensitive to beauty or art. I come from a very poor family. Spending money at the hairdresser’s or on unnecessary beauty accessories was completely out of the question. I only sewed by necessity. For instance, I made dresses for my sisters using cotton pouches that had been used for storing sugar. Still, I’ve always paid a particular attention to my hair.” Alida Provost, 101 years old, Granby, Québec. Provost passed away in 2016.“My father was a painter and craftsman and he shared his love of art with me. I believe that everything that is artistic is beautiful: theater, picture frames, poems, paintings, flowers, songs. In a person, it’s the character, the silhouette, the smile and the eyes that count. That said, my biggest regret is not getting an education. Doors open for you when you’re educated. Otherwise you feel shame. Regardless of the situation, I would advise young women to educate themselves.” Marie-Berthe Paquette, 102 years old, in Montréal, Québec.Arianne Clément began dabbling in documentary photography while working as a journalist in the Canadian Arctic.

If they make the decision quickly that will be wonderful. If they choose not to do so, we will stay hard at this until we achieve the outcomes that I set forth.”Among the 12 conditions laid down by Pompeo were: demand Iran to give a full account of its alleged past work on nuclear weapons development stop all uranium enrichment halt launches of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles end its support for Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad withdraw all forces under Iranian command from Syria and end support for Houthi rebels in Yemen.Pompeo said the Trump administration would not separate negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme from other issues like regional conflicts and missile development.However, he did not make clear how the US would be able galvanise international support for isolating Iran after Trump violated the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – a deal that has widespread global support. European parties to the agreement – the UK, France and Germany – have vowed to try to salvage it and proposed to counteract threatened US sanctions on their companies for continuing to do business with Iran.“The prospect of a new jumbo Iran treaty is going to be very, very difficult,” said the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, after Pompeo’s speech.“I think if you try now to fold all those issues – the ballistic missiles, Iran’s misbehaviour, Iran’s disruptive activity in the region and the nuclear question – if you try to fold all those into a giant negotiation, a new jumbo Iran negotiation, a new treaty – that’s what seems to be envisaged – I don’t see that being very easy to achieve, in anything like a reasonable timetable,” Johnson told journalists in Buenos Aires.He suggested the JCPOA’s narrow range, criticised by Trump and Pompeo, had been a good thing. “The advantage of the JCPOA was that it had a very clear objective. It protected the world from an Iranian nuclear bomb, and in return it gave the Iranians some recognisable economic benefits. That was at the core of it. Johnson added: “The Americans have walked away from that.”Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister tweeted that the United States was repeating “the same wrong choices”. Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution, said: “Pompeo has not outlined a strategy, but rather a grab bag of wishful thinking that can only be interpreted as a call for regime change in Iran. “Note that no other US president has openly sought to effect regime change in Iran. This is a first,” Maloney said in a series of tweets. “This is no longer about Trump fulfilling campaign promises or trying to satisfy his own ego re: a ‘bigger, better deal.’ It’s his infantile approach to foreign policy that purports to solve intractable challenges through the application of maximalist pressure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce40ba7d0f2515d5c15fb858c122e2a0fa86d47/133_140_2153_1292/master/2153.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=857aa175ddc0fb15a3b7678caa5c6741","title":"is abramovich paying price for being too close to putin","story":"Chelsea’s owner is vulnerable to UK retaliation because of his proximity to Russian presidentThere is a compelling, two-word explanation for why Roman Abramovich is apparently having difficulties renewing his British visa: Vladimir Putin.According to reports from Moscow, Abramovich was unable to watch his Chelsea team’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United in Saturday’s FA Cup final at Wembley because his investor’s visa expired last month. His private Boeing jet has not been back to the UK since 1 April. It is uncertain whether the oligarch’s visa woes are temporary and soon to be resolved, or something more permanent akin to a de facto ban. Abramovich has declined to comment. His representatives have said merely, and tactfully, that the process is taking a little longer than usual.Either way, the delay appears to be the result of a new, tougher stance against Russian nationals by the British authorities in the wake of the attempted murder in March of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Relations between London and Moscow are once again in the deep freeze.The government signalled it was reviewing tier 1 investor visas, given to nearly 700 wealthy Russians between 2008 and 2015. Abramovich is one of them. Other oligarchs – some famous names, some lesser known mid-ranking businessmen – will be wondering if they too can expect visa trouble. Abramovich is vulnerable to British retaliation because of his proximity to President Putin. Their relationship goes back a long way. Abramovich was one of Putin’s early supporters. He recommended him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin, when Russia’s ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the high court in London, Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow from the second half of the 1990s. In October 1999, he attended Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Abramovich allegedly bought Putin, then the prime minister, a $50m yacht. “The request came from Mr Putin,” Berezovsky said in evidence.By the time Putin became president in 2000, Abramovich played a key role in shaping the new government, Berezovsky added in his evidence. Abramovich selected members of Putin’s cabinet, he claimed. Abramovich had the power to open and shut criminal cases and to initiate investigations and arrests. it was alleged. He was, in short, a big Kremlin player, albeit one who operated behind the scenes.Abramovich successfully defeated Berezovsky in a subsequent London civil court case and dismisses most of his claims. Still, there is no doubt that Abramovich has friendly relations with Putin. In 2003, Abramovich bought Chelsea football club for £60m. Two years later, he was involved in another larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13bn. The visa review by the British authorities appears to acknowledge the dual role played by oligarchs in Putin’s system. Oligarchs are entrepreneurs. But they can also be state emissaries. From the Sochi Olympics to this summer’s World Cup, oligarchs have fulfilled requests from the presidential administration, building stadiums, international sporting facilities and Russia’s latest bridge to Crimea.Between 2000 and 2008, Abramovich was governor of Chukotka, a sparsely populated and cold region in Russia’s far east. He transformed the territory with his billions. The Chelsea FC owner has bankrolled Russia’s football union and the national squad. His football academy has built all-weather pitches across the country.Roman Borisovich, a Russian anti-corruption campaigner, described the review of investor visas as a “clever and delicate way” of hitting back at Moscow. Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, has suggested Russian businessmen may now take legal action in the British courts. Borisovich predicts this won’t happen.“The last thing these guys want is to have a public hearing in the UK. They would have to answer questions like ‘how did you make your money’ and ‘are you the real owner of your assets’? Plus ‘are you a conduit for the Russian regime or an instrument for meddling in other countries’? “I would like to see all this in the high court.” Borisovich said the UK government was belatedly abandoning its ‘no questions asked’ policy, something that had made London attractive to Russia’s super-rich. He pointed out that Moscow billionaires did not typically move their factories or production centres to the UK. Rather, they deposited their money here, buying up property that could later be resold.In recent years, Abramovich has kept a low profile, both in Russia and the UK. He was at first surprised by the enormous media attention that accompanied his purchase of Chelsea but got used to it, Russian football pundits say. They add that Abramovich is smart, talented, bright and engaged. His last on-the-record interview appears to have been with the Observer back in 2006. Asked where home was – he has several – Abramovich said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow I feel most comfortable.”“It cannot buy you happiness,” Abramovich said, speaking of money. He added: “Some independence, yes.” Seemingly, however, even a lot of money is no guarantee of a British visa. The question for Abramovich now is whether he decides to tough out the latest period of political turbulence. Or sell Chelsea and retreat to Moscow.

Yet, at the time, his non-appearance at Wembley hardly set the alarm bells ringing.The oligarch has become a sporadic visitor to the club into which he has poured more than £1bn since acquiring it in 2003, missing some significant home games en route and never travelling to away fixtures. While he had attended his side’s loss to Arsenal in last season’s FA Cup final and was regularly seen at Stamford Bridge in the first half of this season, the 51-year-old was last in attendance in his box in the middle tier of the West Stand for the victory over Crystal Palace in March.Flight records suggest his private Boeing 767 was last in London on 1 April but, with Chelsea’s Premier League title defence having petered out before Christmas, and Barcelona having eliminated them from the Champions League a few days after the Palace win, it did not seem particularly surprising that he had chosen to stay away.Nor is it unusual for elite Premier League clubs to be overseen by owners from outside the UK. None of those in charge of the top six is based in this country. Sheikh Mansour and Stan Kroenke own Manchester City and Arsenal respectively, while Joe Lewis and John W Henry are in charge of Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. United are under the stewardship of the Americans Joel and Avram Glazer. Avram was at Wembley to see his side beaten by Chelsea on Saturday.Regardless, while Abramovich is far from an absentee owner, he has long delegated the day-to-day running of the club to his trusted lieutenants on the ground in London. Principal among them on the football side is Marina Granovskaia, formerly an employee of the oil company Sibneft, who has worked closely with Abramovich for more than 18 years. She had acted as a representative of the owner at the club, and in support of the board of directors, before formally joining the board of Chelsea FC plc in the summer of 2013.Russian-born and a dual Russian and Canadian national, Granovskaia has become increasingly influential at Stamford Bridge, undertaking negotiations over player transfers and contracts, as well as managerial appointments. She assimilated the duties of the team’s technical director into her own following Michael Emenalo’s departure last November, and was at Wembley among the dignitaries from both clubs on Saturday.She is joined on the board of Chelsea FC plc by Eugene Tenenbaum, a Canadian financier who worked as corporate finance chief in Abramovich’s oil business and accompanied the Russian to London in 2003, and the chairman, Bruce Buck, a lawyer by trade. Guy Laurence, previously of Vodafone UK and Rogers Communications, commenced his duties as chief executive in February.Chelsea FC plc’s ultimate parent company is Fordstam Limited, which boasts a debt of around £1.1bn in the form of an interest-free loan from Abramovich, theoretically repayable on 18 months’ notice. The parent company’s money has been ploughed into Chelsea FC plc as equity, and then on to the football club itself – Chelsea Ltd – again as equity. Fordstam informed Companies House on 23 March that it was changing its owner’s residence to “Russia”.Chelsea may have been crowned Premier League champions in 2017, but they have checked the lavish spending of the early Abramovich era in recent times – much to the frustration of the current head coach, Antonio Conte – as they seek to comply with Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations and become less reliant upon the owner’s funds. Some have viewed that as an indication enthusiasm is on the wane for his footballing plaything.In truth, Abramovich continues to pump money into the club – £34m in the 12-month period up to June 2017, for example – and is intent upon redeveloping Stamford Bridge, having been granted planning permission in January 2017 for a £1bn project to increase the stadium’s capacity to 60,000. The anticipated costs have escalated wildly, largely due to the length of time allocated to the build and the complexity of the plans, with Abramovich apparently exploring the possibility of outside investors buying into the redevelopment project."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05cd4c489f6b8494e5ca7b600ebe4090123bca8/0_270_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9677fc644fed07e90a366db00d3cbd4c","title":"italy populist coalition set to name political novice as pm nominee","story":"Expectation that M5S and League leaders will put forward Giuseppe Conte triggers financial jittersItalian financial markets have been in turmoil as the country awaits news about whether an unknown law professor without any political experience will be named as the next prime minister.The country’s two populist parties – the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), and the anti-migrant League – announced a joint agreement naming Giuseppe Conte, 53, a lawyer and M5S member, as the next leader of the eurozone’s third largest economy, after Matteo Salvini of the League, and Luigi Di Maio, of the M5S, ruled themselves out.The deal came after weeks of intense negotiations between Salvini and Di Maio, who are attempting to cobble together a government based on their shared views. The parties’ agenda calls for sweeping fiscal changes, a more confrontational stance against Brussels, and a tougher approach against migrants, including the creation of detention centres across the country.Conte still requires the blessing of Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, who met with Salvini and Di Maio on Monday evening.“We obviously want a country that puts the interests of Italians first. We are ready to go, no one has anything to fear,” Salvini said following his meeting with Mattarella. Late on Monday, Mattarella asked the two speakers of parliament – but not Conte – to meet him on Tuesday at the presidential palace to continue consultations. After weeks of negotiation, when it seemed only an election over the summer might end the political impasse, the reality of the rocky road ahead and the elevation of a populist government to lead one of the EU’s largest countries seemed to hit home.Fitch, the ratings agency, warned that the incoming populist government could pose a risk to Italy’s credit profile, and there was heavy trading in equity and bond markets amid questions about the groups’ Eurosceptic policies.In Brussels, Conte’s nomination to be PM was met with puzzlement. “Nobody knows who he is and he is not even a high-profile academic,” said one EU official, noting that even Italians had been joking that the man who could be their next prime minister was less well-known than his namesake, the Chelsea FC manager Antonio Conte. Lorenzo Codogno, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said: “He will have no experience in government and he will be effectively catapulted into the job without having named the cabinet or decided the programme. I am not saying he is a puppet, but the powers he will have are limited.”Codogno, a former Italian treasury official who participated in EU councils, said the EU was deeply concerned about the new Italian government. “There are a lot of worries: it is the first country in the eurozone with a populist government,” he said. If the government followed through on reports of a €100bn financial stimulus without describing how they intend to pay for it, Rome would have to ask for more flexibility from EU eurozone rules, he said.“If that happens it is likely to lead to a very confrontational situation with Europe and the commission,” Codogno said. “If you have a government behaving like a maverick, financial markets can move and if they move a lot they can cause a crisis, they can enter into a situation where a shock in financial markets can occur again.”Given Conte’s lack of political experience, analysts on Monday said decisions on key ministerial positions would probably reveal the government’s intentions. Salvini, who is staunchly anti-migrant and has touted a plan of mass deportation for undocumented people, has been touted as a possible interior minister, with control of the country’s migration policies. Di Maio has been touted as labour minister.“A lot of promises they’ve made are utterly unrealistic, and they will have to pick their priorities,” said the analyst and author Wolfango Piccoli. The new government has also inherited some difficult problems, and will need to find €12.5bn euros in the budget to meet EU budgetary commitment. They will also have to agree a plan on Alitalia, including a possible partial nationalisation of the Italian airline, and will have to make staff decisions on a host of big public institutions, like the Rai broadcaster.Piccoli predicted that one of the few agenda items that will hold the M5S and the League together will be their shared criticism of Brussels, which is likely to object to the incoming government on issues ranging from the budget, to migration, to its desire for stronger ties with Russia.Conte, a law professor at the University of Florence, is Di Maio’s personal lawyer and the mastermind behind the anti-establishment party’s pledge to abolish more than 400 “useless laws” that it claims will cut bureaucracy and free up the economy.He also said during the election campaign that Italy’s anti-corruption laws needed to be tightened and major school changes introduced.The professor, originally from the southern region of Puglia, was previously aligned to the left before joining M5S.Mattarella will need to ratify the choice of prime minister, the proposed programme of policies and cabinet lineup before a government can be sworn in. It will then face a vote of confidence in both houses of parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7840db8ad6261550e26cdf5baf018aa2fbbd1f1b/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86cadaa1b3ac19507bcee3693250f454","title":"roman abramovich thought to be caught up in uk visa crackdown","story":"Chelsea owner’s application still being considered after the Russian’s previous visa expiredRoman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, could be asked to explain the source of his vast wealth before he is granted a new UK visa.The Russian oligarch’s investor visa application is still being considered after his previous one, which was granted before tighter regulations were introduced in April 2015, expired.No 10 said that while it would not comment on inidual cases, it was the “logical conclusion” that some wealthy iniduals who had applied under the investment visa route before the changes would no longer be eligible.The government launched a further crackdown on wealthy investors coming to the UK after the Salisbury poisoning, increasing tensions between Britain and Russia.Downing Street confirmed it was looking at iniduals who were still in the UK and holding tier 1 visas, which allow anyone who invests more than £2m in the British economy to stay for 40 months.Responding to the reports on the delay with Abramovich’s visa, the Kremlin claimed that Russian businesses often encountered “unfair and unfriendly” actions when applying to come to the UK.But Theresa May’s official spokesman said: “The prime minister has been absolutely clear that our argument is not with the Russian people, our dispute is with the Russian government.”The changes introduced in 2015 mean that Abramovich will face tougher standards when reapplying for his new tier 1 visa, which he will have to do from outside the UK, probably in Russia.Applications can be rejected if officials believe the applicant is not in control of funds, money has been obtained unlawfully, or the origin of funds means granting a visa will not be conducive to the public good.There is no suggestion that Abramovich has been involved in any wrongdoing.Abramovich, who was last seen publicly at a court hearing in Switzerland on Friday, missed Chelsea’s FA Cup final victory over Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday. The Saratov-born businessman has owned the club since 2003.Tier 1 visas are thought to be held by about 700 wealthy Russians.“We are currently taking another look at how the route operates and are undertaking further checks on investors who came to the UK through this route before the reforms were introduced,” a Downing Street spokesman said.No 10 also confirmed additional checks had been taking place at private airfields after the Salisbury attack in March.Abramovich’s visa is thought to have expired in April while he was out of the country and he has not tried to enter Britain since. His new application would have to be made from abroad, which means he will be subject to slightly more rigorous criteria than if he applied from within the UK. Someone who knows Abramovich told the  on Sunday that he had not been denied a visa but it was taking longer than usual to renew, and it was unclear why. A representative for Abramovich declined to comment, calling it a personal matter.Russian officials complained on Monday that the UK was wielding the issuance or denial of visas as a weapon in the growing political standoff between Moscow and London.Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, told the  in response to a question on Abramovich: “It’s obvious that for the British government both visas and the regulation of the media sphere are instruments of politics.” It is not known where the billionaire is currently. He was last seen in public at the hearing at the district court of Sarine in Fribourg. A representative for Abramovich told the  that he would not comment on his location.Publicly available tracking data showed that a Gulfstream jet believed to be used by Abramovich flew from southern France, where he owns an estate on the Cap d’Antibes peninsula, to Switzerland on Thursday before the court hearing. The same plane returned to southern France on Friday. It has not left since, according to the data. Public tracking data also shows that Abramovich’s luxury yacht, Eclipse, is currently moored off Antibes. His Boeing 767 last flew from Moscow to Nice on 8 May, according to public data from the website FlightRadar24. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP on the foreign affairs select committee, said he regarded the delay in granting Abramovich a visa as “a sign that the card of Putin and his allies is finally being marked”.With the imminent passage through parliament of the sanctions bill, he said it would be possible to put those close to Putin on an open list either for sanctions or visa refusal. “It is best this is done as openly and transparently as possible, with carrots and sticks for good behaviour,” Bryant said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762365d533459b490c594fcf4d1bff0b849353b2/0_0_6346_3806/master/6346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85cd6c87ff1695c4ff720c333984561f","title":"sanja matsuri festival yakuza day in pictures","story":"Sanja Matsuri festival is a celebration of the three legendary founders of Sensoji Temple in the Asakusa neighbourhood, with nearly two million people visiting during the three-day event.

Photograph: ReutersDenis BalibouseThe first study of exposure in adults to glyphosate, the most commonly used pesticide in Ireland, has found the general population is subjected to “low exposure” from the chemical but within acceptable EU safety limits.Led by NUI Galway (NUIG) researchers, it investigated background levels of the active ingredient in more than 750 products including Roundup, the world’s commonly used herbicide, which is made by Monsanto. Glyphosate is extensively used in agriculture and horticulture to combat weeds, and is sprayed as a pre-harvest treatment on some food crops. It is also widely sprayed in parks, public spaces, lawns, gardens and roadsides. It was re-licensed by the EU last year for five instead of the usual 15 years because of a scientific row over whether it causes cancer.Since then, several EU municipalities, regions and countries have moved to ban it, while MEPs have called for a phase-out by 2022. The European Commission, ahead of the renewal, recommended it be limited in public spaces and at harvest time but backed off this after intensive lobbying.France and Germany are weighing up all-out bans, but farmers and local authorities are struggling to find other effective options available at reasonable cost.NUIG researchers and collaborators from the UK Health and Safety Executive measured glyphosate in urine samples provided by 50 Irish adults to estimate background levels of exposure among this population. Of the samples analysed, 20 per cent had detectable trace levels of glyphosate. Concentrations were more than 1,000 times lower than the “acceptable daily intake” level set by the European Food Safety Authority. The study, published in the journal Environmental Research, was carried out by PhD student Alison Connolly and post graduate student Michelle Leahy.

Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503468.1526930415!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"catalan leader in clash with madrid over provocative cabinet choices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNewly elected Catalan regional leader Quim Torra outside the Estremera prison near Madrid where he visited Jordi Turull, Josep Rull and  other pro-independence politicians who are jailed there. Photograph: Sergio PerezReutersThe Catalan independence movement is entrenched in a fresh stand-off with Madrid, after the new president of the north-eastern region named several jailed and exiled politicians in his cabinet.Quim Torra, an outspoken secessionist who took office as Catalan president last week, announced the names of his 13 ministers on Saturday. However, two of his choices, Jordi Turull and Josep Rull, are in prison ahead of their trial for rebellion and other charges related to their alleged involvement in an independence bid last autumn. Two others, Antoni Comín and Lluís Puig, are living in Belgium to avoid facing the Spanish justice system.The Spanish government had been expected to end its implementation of direct rule in Catalonia this week, but the controversy stirred by Mr Torra’s appointments means it remains in place.In a statement, the prime minister’s office described the move as a “provocation” and on Monday deputy prime minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría said Mr Torra has “begun an absolutely perverse dynamic”. She drew particular attention to the fact that the health ministry, seen as a key portfolio due to recent pressures, had been entrusted to Mr Comín, who is abroad.The government has said it will not publish the names of the new ministers in the official register until constitutional experts have decided on the legality of the Catalan president’s choices. However, political pressure is already building for Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy to keep in place article 155, the constitutional clause which has allowed him to rule the region from Madrid since October.The stridently unionist Ciudadanos party has called for the measure to be broadened to centralise control of the Catalan police and public broadcaster. And on Monday, socialist leader Pedro Sánchez appeared to harden his stance, comparing the new regional president to French far-right leader Marine Le Pen. “The one prolonging article 155 is Mr Torra,” he said, claiming that there was an institutional vacuum in Catalonia.But Mr Torra was unrepentant on Monday as he visited Mr Turull, Mr Rull and other pro-independence politicians in Estremera jail, near Madrid.“Catalonia is waiting for its honest, honourable and democratic politicians, who only did what the people asked them to do,” he said.He added that Mr Turull and Mr Rull had confirmed their determination to take up their designated posts and that they have asked the supreme court to grant them leave in order to attend their swearing-in ceremonies.Protests against article 155 were staged in Barcelona, Lleida and other cities across Catalonia on Monday evening.As he decides how to respond to the latest developments, Mr Rajoy must take into account the 2018 budget. In order to get the bill approved in a parliamentary vote on Wednesday, Mr Rajoy’s Popular Party (PP) will almost certainly require the support of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), which has repeatedly warned it will vote against the budget if article 155 is still in place in Catalonia.Approval of the budget would guarantee a degree of stability for the governing party until the next general election is due, in 2020, while its rejection could trigger a snap vote."},{"url":null,"title":"britain s prince harry marries meghan markle at windsor castle","story":"  May 20, 2018Ceremony saw break from tradition as bride did not vow to obey her husband   May 19, 2018British designer Clare Waight Keller worked with US actress on wedding day outfit   May 20, 2018Meghan Markle has come to stand for something much more than the woman with whom the affable Prince Harry happened to fall in love "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year. Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

The Trump administration dismissed the election as a sham with Mike Pence, the US vice president, calling it a further blow to the proud democratic tradition of Venezuela.Speaking from the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, acknowledged that more sanctions could be necessary.Venezuela is an absolutely tragic story of a people kept hostage to a defunct ideology,’’ he said.  The Lima Group, an organisation of 12 American countries that aims to devise solutions to the Venezuela crisis, promised not to recognise the results and recalled its ambassadors from Caracas for consultations.“These elections didn’t comply with international standards of a democratic process that is free, fair, and transparent,” the group said in a statement.Main opposition parties had called for their supporters to boycott the process as soon as the election date was set, citing a lack of basic electoral guarantees and transparency.“I just decided I wasn’t going to fall into their trap again like I had before,” said Raquel Hernandez Monday, a longtime opposition supporter.  “We knew what these results would be from the beginning.”  Instead of voting, Ms Hernandez spent the day washing clothes and cooking “to take advantage since there’s water.”  As part of the country’s ongoing crisis, water shortages and blackouts have become common.   Throughout the day photos and videos circulated on Twitter showing empty polling stations and election workers asleep at their desks as most in opposition strongholds seemed to heed their leaders’ calls for a boycott.  Marcos Carbono, a Venezuelan exile, takes part in a protest against Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and the Venezuelan presidential elections in Miami, FloridaHenri Falcon, a former governor who broke with the opposition coalition to take on the president, earned 21 per cent of the vote. In the face of the mounting pressure, Mr Maduro will need to maintain his base at home to prevent upheaval.Polls have shown he maintains roughly 20 per cent support.“This revolution cannot be defeated and those elites will never return,” said Juan Torres, a government supporter, on Monday. “This is an independent Venezuela and not the United States’ back yard.”  The cost of coffee has jumped over 16,400 per cent in one yearAfter results were released on Sunday night, Mr Torres blasted pro-government songs in his slum as others in high-rise apartment buildings beat sauce pans in protest.Pro-government gangs known as colectivos took to Caracas’ streets on motorbikes, revving their engines in opposition majority areas in an apparent warning against anyone considering protesting.Venezuelan citizens living in Colombia protest against the presidential electionsMr Johnson, speaking on a tour of Latin America, said a G20 meeting would discuss the Venezuela election and the prospect of sanctions.He also raised concerns that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, had failed to explicitly condemn the Venezuelan regime.Please review our commenting policyInside the royal wedding evening receptionMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon\u0026#39Alien\u0026#39 asteroid discovered orbiting the wrong way near Jupiter First official royal wedding photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle releasedRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workInside the royal wedding evening reception: Idris Elba turned DJ as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle danced to 1980s hits and R\u0026ampBMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleMy son was a \u0026#39victim of war\u0026#39, Terry Butcher says as inquest hears of soldier\u0026#39s struggle with PTSD and drugs Comment: Let\u0026#39s cling onto why we first liked Meghan Markle – if only for \u0026#39darling old Harry’s\u0026#39 sakeMaypole row over pole that requires planning permissionComment: How odd.

Use by dates are used to show consumers when perishable foods like meats and dairy items are no longer safe to eat. Love food hate waste | Tips on saving food from the binIt follows a recent campaign by the National Federation of Women’s Institutes  into causes of food waste, which found that less than half of respondents understood the meaning of Best Before dates.The average home throws away £700 of food every year, with fresh fruit and vegetables among the most commonly thrown in the bin. Tesco\u0027s head of food waste, Mark Little, said: “We know some customers may be confused by the difference between ‘Best Before’ and ‘Use By’ dates on food and this can lead to perfectly edible items being thrown away before they need to be discarded.“We have made this change to fruit and vegetable packaging as they are among the most wasted foods.ruit and vegetables are displayed for sale at a grocers shop“Many customers have told us that they assess their fruit and vegetables by the look of the product rather than the ‘Best Before’ date code on the packaging.”The Food Standards Agency states that “the best before date, sometimes shown as BBE, is about quality and not safety. The food will be safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best.”David Moon, head of business collaboration, WRAP said:“Through the Courtauld Commitment 2025, WRAP is working with the food \u0026amp drink sector to review all the evidence on date labelling for fresh produce and agree best practice. This change by Tesco provides a good opportunity to learn about the customer response, and we anticipate Tesco will share their findings.With all fresh produce, appropriate storage including use of the refrigerator is essential in giving the customer more time to use their food, so clarity of storage advice on pack and in-store will be vital.”Fruit and vegetablesInside the royal wedding evening receptionMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry will live as a married coupleRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon\u0026#39Alien\u0026#39 asteroid discovered orbiting the wrong way near Jupiter First official royal wedding photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle releasedRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workInside the royal wedding evening reception: Idris Elba turned DJ as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle danced to 1980s hits and R\u0026ampBMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleNicolas Maduro filmed victoriously waving to an empty plaza after \u0026#39sham\u0026#39 election My son was a \u0026#39victim of war\u0026#39, Terry Butcher says as inquest hears of soldier\u0026#39s struggle with PTSD and drugs Comment: Let\u0026#39s cling onto why we first liked Meghan Markle – if only for \u0026#39darling old Harry’s\u0026#39 sakeMaypole row over pole that requires planning permissionComment: How odd.

This was not expected.But the salamanders face extinction in the wild, due in no small part to demand for the amphibians as luxury food.In a second study, Samuel Turvey from the Zoological Society of London found that populations of this once-widespread species are now critically depleted or extirpated across all surveyed areas of their range, and illegal poaching is widespread.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.In fact, some of the five newly identified species may already be extinct in the wild.The overexploitation of these incredible animals for human consumption has had a catastrophic effect on their numbers in the wild over an amazingly short time , Mr Turvey said.  Unless coordinated conservation measures are put in place as a matter of urgency, the future of the world\u0027s largest amphibian is in serious jeopardy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We had many, many people come who wanted to celebrate.”Strange island: Pacific tribesmen come to study BritainWith the atmosphere further lifted by kava, a drink made from a plant root said to have sedative and mood-enhancing qualities, the celebration seems to have been even more joyous than those for the duke’s 89th birthday on June 10 2010.That was when it had been prophesied that Prince Philip would come to Tanna to be with his people, living in a hut and hunting wild pigs with them.The slight disappointment that the dukeMessiah was a no-show on that occasion was mitigated by the fact that British gap year student Marc Rayner, 18, was on hand to act as a stand-in.As a stickler for protocol, the duke would doubtless have been glad to hear that Mr Rayner adopted formal dress by wearing a nambas, a slightly more extensive version of the penis sheaths that Tanna men wear in everyday life.“They are a wonderful people and I didn’t want them to feel let down,” said Mr Rayner.  “I stepped in to explain that the prince\u0027s many responsibilities prevented him from visiting in person - but that he would one day rest in spirit on the island.”As it is, however, although Tanna is the home of the so-called “cargo cult” known as the Prince Philip Movement, the duke – in bodily, if not spirit form – has never set foot on the island, one of 82 in the Vanuatu archipelago.The closest he came was in 1974, when he visited the Vanuatu capital Port Vila on the royal yacht Britannia with the Queen.Chief Jack Naiva, one of the paddlers of a traditional war canoe which greeted the royal yacht, was quoted as saying: I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform. I knew then that he was the true messiah.Tanna elders later sent Prince Philip a nal nal hunting club.  He sent them back a picture of himself holding the club.  The photo has become a cherished religious icon on Tanna.In the village of Yaohnanen there is a sort of shrine to the duke, with a Union Flag draped over framed photographs of the Queen’s consort.Last year’s announcement that he would be retiring from public life did nothing to dampen the people of Tanna’s devotion to him.Jimmy Joseph Nakou told reporters from the Associated Press that it was still the custom for villagers in Yaohnanen and Yakel to gather every evening, drink kava, and pray to Prince Philip.“We ask him to increase the production of our crops in the garden, or to give us the sun, or rain,” he said.  “And it happens.“Here in Tanna, we believe that Prince Philip is the son of our god, our ancestral god, who lives up in the mountain.Top gear: William and Kate had an Aston Martin with balloons and a JUST WED number plate.

But the cults reflect quite logical and rational attempts to make sense out of a social order that appears senseless and chaotic.”  He outlined how South Pacific populations with “highly developed cultures” had been subjected to “enormous social stress and strain” by the arrival of Europeans with “cargo” – Pidgin English for trade goods – and frightening technological power.With the 19th Century traders came missionaries, who thought it would be clever to try to make Christian ideas like the Second Coming more palatable by tacking them on to existing South Pacific beliefs.The result, however, seems to have been that instead of Christinaity, beliefs grew up that a local hero or god would come to initiate paradise on Earth and bless the people of the South Pacific with the riches of the white man’s cargo.Worsley explained that the seizure of islanders for work on the plantations of Australia and Fiji left them disinclined to swallow whole the missionaries’s teachings: “The splendid vision of the equality of all Christians began to seem a pious deception in face of the realities of the colour bar, the multiplicity of rival Christian missions and the open irreligion of many Whites.“They found that acceptance of Christianity did not bring the cargo any nearer. They grew disillusioned.”Prince Philip asks \u0027Is that a terrorist?\u0027 after seeing bearded manPrince Philip believed in nuclear disarmament, letters revealPrince Philip \u0027told Blair’s team to f*** off’ over Diana’s funeral96 Prince Philip gaffes in 96 yearsThen the Second World War came to the Pacific.On Vanuatu the appearance of so many troops and so much US military hardware seems to have boosted the “John Frum Movement” that had begun in the 1930s, and was still going strong in 1960 when David Attenborough visited to be told about a Messiah figure: “’E look like you. ‘E got white face. ‘E tall man. ‘E live ‘long South America.”On Tanna, the John Frum Movement seems to have morphed into the Prince Philip Movement some time in the 1950s or 1960s.One theory is that people on Tanna noticed the respect with which British colonial officials spoke of the Queen, and aligned Prince Philip with their traditional belief that the son of the mountain god would travel over the sea, marry a powerful woman and eventually return to his people.  One Tanna elder has suggested that the Prince Philip Movement will not die with him but be passed on to his children, and his children\u0027s children (Getty Images  WPA Pool  Pool)And at the time the duke\u0027s retirement, it was also suggested that the Prince Philip Movement would not die with him.Tanna elder Chief Tom Numake was quoted as saying: “Just because he has retired, it doesn\u0027t just stop.“It will be passed on to his children, and if they have children then it will continue on through them. The followers don\u0027t just see it as Prince Philip but that it will continue going on through the bloodline.Which does now rather suggest that in the unlikely form of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle has just got herself hitched to a husband who might one day, just possibly, come to be seen, as the Messiah, not a very naughty boy. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle weddingor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He is still wearing his Dr Martens and his ceremonial chain.“It’s a good accessory,” he smiles.Asked how he feels about the global reaction to his now famous official inauguration photo, Councillor Magid Magid’s response is as unorthodox as the image itself.Lord Mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid (Chris Saunders)“Mate… f*****g hell…” he tells The Independent, still apparently struggling for words. “It’s been surreal. Mad. I wasn’t expecting any of this.”The 28-year-old’s election as the South Yorkshire city’s official first citizen last week made headlines around the world. He has received messages of goodwill from people as far and wide as New York and Syria. ITV News anchor Charlene White declared on Twitter that she might be “a little bit in love”.This is partly because of who he is and what he’s achieved. Councillor Magid is not only the city’s youngest ever lord mayor – and the first from the Green Party – he is also a Muslim former Somalian refugee who arrived in the UK at the age of five, unable to speak English.And it is partly because of that picture. In it, amid the shadowy, gilded confines of Sheffield’s Victorian Town Hall, he squats – complete with ceremonial chain, Dr Martens boots and wide-eyed smile – high on a balustrade.‘If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done’That Councillor Magid – who once appeared on Channel 4 reality show Hunted – is different there is no doubt.He was elected here after being nominated by his three Green Party council colleagues. When I later ask one, Alison Teal, why they put him forward, her response is simple. “He’s charming and magnetic,” she says. “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like him. He’s a born lord mayor.”The main message he wants to get across during his year in post is one of inspiring others.“If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done,” he says. “That, and to get people talking about Sheffield, about what a brilliant, erse city it is.”The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreAt his inauguration, he entered the chamber to Star Wars music and thanked his mum for “putting up with all my shit” growing up.“I was a handful,” he explains today. “Typical teenager. The important thing was thanking my mum because she’s the reason I’m here, her courage and determination for a better life.”It was his mother, Amina Deria, indeed, who took young Magid – along with his older sister Hanan Mah – out of war torn Burao in northern Somalia. After six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp, they arrived in the Burngreave area of Sheffield where she worked as a cleaner.“To me,” he says, “it’s always been home.”He did well enough at school and, after some time out in which he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, went to the University of Hull to study marine biology. There, he was elected president of the students’ union.“I cared about issues but I was pretty naive about politics,” he says. “I remember a hustings, someone asked if I was going to join a picket line. I was thinking: ‘What the fuck is a picket line?’ But I gambled and said, ‘Yeah, of course I am’, and there was a round of applause.”Around 2015, alarmed by the rise of Ukip and anti-immigration rhetoric, he joined the Greens back in Sheffield where he was working in digital marketing. He was elected to the city council a year later.“This rising xenophobic language affects me and my loved ones,” he explains. “There’s that expression that if you don’t do politics, politics will do you. I just felt I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and let that language go unchallenged. It legitimises racism and it needs to be tackled. I wanted my voice in the debate. Local politics was a way to do that.”Among his main beliefs are devolved local power, free education, an end to PFI and the creation of a republic.Now, as lord mayor, he will, as convention dictates, act as a city figurehead. “I had a white tie dinner last night,” he tells me. “I went to hire the suit – £120! I was saying: ‘I want to hire it, not buy it.’”But he plans to open the role up too. He promises to go to more events involving underrepresented communities, and wants magicians and musicians to perform in council meeting intervals – as a way of encouraging more people to interact with local democracy.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesMarcio and Andreia Gomes, parents of Logan Gomes, arrive for a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London.Brackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule.

I respect this decision and I will stay with my family in the country.” The government has also dismissed the attorney general who cleared Mr Najib of wrongdoing in 2016 and the head of the treasury who was also the 1MDB state fund chairman.In a post on Twitter earlier this week celebrating the holy month of Ramadan, Mr Najib asked for “the forgiveness of past sins”.

He recalls the pressures organising LGBT football games in regional cities — only to see them cancelled at last minute. He recalls the phone calls from security services and numerous other such incidents.But, according to Mr Agapov, the authorities have seemingly undergone a total conversion in time for this summer\u0027s World Cup. Under the watchful eye of FIFA, Russia’s bureaucrats are, apparently, now fully signed up to the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination. For one month at least, Russia’s “traditional values” are being put to one side, and the most pernicious interpretations of a 2013 law banning “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors” forgotten. World Cup 2018 squad guide: Latest news and updates ahead of RussiaOfficial statements have been bold enough. The Russian Football Union\u0027s Alexei Smertin, a World Cup ambassador, said there would be no bans on rainbow flags, or same-sex partners showing affection. “You can kiss all you like, and hug one another, within the bounds of normal reason,” he has said. Similar assurances have come from the Organising Committee.  The prospect of a gay-friendly competition taking place in Russia would usually provoke howls of derision from its ultraconservative voices. But not this time.Russia’s most prominent anti-gay campaigner, the outspoken deputy Vitaly Milonov, has built a career on homophobic remarks. But in comments to The Independent, he was strangely non-committal. He claimed that Russian supporters would never do such things as show rainbow flags in stadia, he said. But it was not up to him to tell officials like Mr Smertin what the Russian policy should be. And he would not be staging any personal protest either.  Reverting to his usual discriminatory language, almost as an afterthought, Mr Milonov added: “We have never persecuted people on account of their Satanic sexual perversions,” he said.  World news in picturesWorld news in picturesNewly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

A vibrant gay scene exists in many of its major cities, and its younger generation is more tolerant. But several years of state-sponsored homophobia have had an effect on the general population. Since the controversial 2013 anti-gay law was passed, the number of recorded hate crimes has doubled. Polls also indicate a growing intolerance of LGBT communities. In more lawless corners of the Russian Federation, the situation is uglier. Last year, credible reports emerged from the largely-Muslim republic of Chechnya suggesting more than 100 men were tortured on account of their sexuality. At least three died many are still missing. Alexander Kondakov, a researcher at St Petersburg’s Centre for Independent Social Research says the tournament has the makings of a toxic cocktail. “You have a tournament celebrating hypermasculinity taking place in a country where the government is actively supporting hatred with rhetoric and legislation,” he said. “Then you add alcohol into the mix”Violence against LGBT supporters was not only possible but likely, he added. According to Mr Kondakov, Russian activists have welcomed the Kremlin’s discovery of LGBT rights. But there are few illusions that it will lead to a change in direction, or a new inclusive or positive agenda. “The rare positive steps we see usually end with the most ordinary of homophobia,” he says. Indeed, far from providing a springboard for local LGBT rights, the World Cup has arguably played into anti-gay propaganda, said Mr Agapov. “By emphasising the safety of foreign LGBT fans, authorities have managed to present homosexuality as something foreign, un-Russian,” he said. “Clearly, they will do everything to make sure the World Cup passes trouble-free, but when it does, the discrimination, the homophobia, and the laws will remain.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The day marks the killing of six Arab Israelis during 1976 demonstrations against Israeli confiscations of Arab land.Known as Sairoon, Arabic for “On the Move”, the group has said it would focus on rebuilding infrastructure and providing health and education to the poor.“The importance of this vote is that it is a clear message that the people want to change the system of governance which has produced corruption and weakened the state institutions,” said communist party secretary general, Raed Fahmy.By contrast, incumbent prime minister Mr al-Abadi has performed poorly, placing third or fourth in many provinces and finishing as low as fifth in Baghdad.In a national address on Monday, he vowed to keep the country safe under his command until a new government is formed. “I call on Iraqis to respect the results of the elections”, he added.Women brace for Iraq\u0027s election after race marked by harassment Trump heralds capture of five Isis commanders after Iraq announcementWhat would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? 15 years ago we invaded Iraq – the repercussions are still being felt Only 44 per cent of voters turned out, the lowest in the four elections since the removal of Saddam.Under the Iraqi system, one of the dozens of coalitions formed for the election must gain a majority of the 329 seats in parliament in order to choose a prime minister and form a government, a process that may take months. Political power in the country is traditionally ided along sectarian lines among the offices of prime minister, president and parliament speaker. The Shia majority has held the position of prime minister in elections since the fall of the Saddam regime, while the Kurds hold the presidency and the post of parliament speak is held open for Sunnis.Under the Iraqi constitution, no less than a quarter of the parliamentary seats must be held by women, with nearly 2,600 running for office this year.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here is the lowdown...The throne will pass to Prince Charles if the Queen abdicates, retires or dies – and according to reports, abdication could be a real possibility.Her Majesty is said to have told her inner circle that if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation to grant her eldest son full power to reign while she is alive.Royal commentator Robert Jobson told the Mail On Sunday he has spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who say preparations for the transition of the Crown are gaining pace.And at this years Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, The Queen said she wished for Charles to succeed her as head of the group of countries.Next in line after Charles is eldest son Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and then his children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and the new baby boy, Prince Louis.Prince Harry - who was third in line to the throne in 2013 - is now sixth in line.Following his wedding to Meghan Markle, any children that they produce would come after him in the line of succession.The rules of Royal succession have changed significantly in recent years.Leaders of 16 British Commonwealth countries (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica) voted in 2011 to alter the centuries-old tradition to include daughters as well as sons.Previously daughters could only inherit the throne if there were no living sons.This system, which dated back 300 years, is based on the rules of primogeniture which gives preference to the firstborn male heirs of a king or queen.This change in royal succession means Princess Charlotte, as William and Kates daughter, is ahead of her younger brother.Previously if the third child was male he would leap the princess in the line of succession.This new rule only takes into account children born after 2011, meaning Prince Edwards youngest child, James, born in 2007, is ahead of his older sister, Louise, born in 2003.Commonwealth leaders also decided in 2011 to remove the rule that no heir could assume the throne if he or she married a Roman Catholic.Then Prime Minister David Cameron said at the time: “The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man just isn’t acceptable anymore.Nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic.“The thinking behind these rules is wrong.The Roman Catholic rule can be traced to the 16th-century reign of Henry VIII.The King broke with the Roman Catholic Church to divorce his wife, Queen Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn.The changes, under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, came into force in March 2015 but apply to people born after October 28, 2011.Live Science reported that because one of the duties of the British monarch is to head the Church of England, no Roman Catholic can hold the crown.The basis for the succession was determined in the 17th century.When James II fled the country in 1688, Parliament held that he had abdicated the government and that the throne was vacant.The throne was then offered, not to Jamess young son, but to his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, as joint rulers, following the Glorious Revolution.At 69-years-old, Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in UK history - having been first in line from the age of three - and would become the oldest ever British monarch to take the throne.Some royalists have argued that Prince Charles should step aside to allow Prince William to become King because he enjoys better approval ratings with the public based on a poll last year.Prince Charles has faced controversy over his divorce from Princess Diana and his affair during their marriage with wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.He has also been accused of “meddling” in politics by stating his opinion on issues like the environment and farming, alternative medicine and architecture in private letters to Government ministers.In 1936, Edward VIII - the Queens uncle - famously abdicated after less than a year on the throne so he could marry divorcee Wallis Simpson.Prince Harry says no Royal wants to be King or Queen — but they would do it for “the greater good”.The 33-year-old said: “Is there any one of the Royal Family who wants to be king or queen?I don’t think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.”He told Newsweek magazine: “We are involved in modernising the British monarchy.We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people.”And he insisted the Royals were still vital, adding: “We don’t want to dilute the magic.“The British public and the whole world need institutions like it.”The long-serving royal is stepping back from a public role after 65 years of Royal duties.His final solo engagement was The Captain General’s Parade in August 2017, when he saluted the Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace.Due to English common laws, he cannot become king.The wife of a king is known as a Queen Consort, and takes the title of Queen – although she doesn’t rule as the monarch.But if a female royal marries a man with a title below her own - as in the case of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip - she will retain the title while her husband will not be entitled to it.He is known as Prince Consort.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime.

She could easily have become trapped in the web of regal traditions.But Meghan navigated the intricacies with aplomb to pull off the most contemporary and delightfully multi-cultural royal wedding Britain has ever seen.There was a gospel choir, a bride’s mother with a nose stud and a star-studded guest list that was far more Soho House than Buck House. And of course, the aforementioned preacher Michael Curry.He milked his moment at the pulpit with a relentlessly repetitive call to love that went on . . . and on . . . and on, and clearly tickled some royals so much they looked fit to burst.The younger, modernising royals are now regarded more as celebrities than figureheads and this was a highly public melding of the old and new.After all Meghan, 36, is a divorcee with life experience, not some privileged ingenue straight out of finishing school.In Suits, the US telly series she starred in, her character married in a dress Meghan herself chose and described as “classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for”.The same could be said of yesterday’s creation by British designer Clare Waight Keller.In a nod to history, Meghan topped it with Queen Mary’s 1932 diamond bandeau tiara.And her “glam squad” of make-up artists, hairdresser, eyebrow shaper and skin guru worked their magic to accentuate a naturally radiant glow without looking overdone.She walked into the chapel alone, a break with form spun as a “bold, feminist statement” but really borne from sad necessity by her father’s absence.Meghan passed her Suits co-stars and the majority of the other celebrity guests in the Nave — what might be described as the cheap seats. Even Patrick J Adams, who played Suits love interest Mike Ross, was there.Yet curiously, celebrity royalty George and Amal Clooney were placed in the Quire alongside the Royal Family. Go figure.As Meghan reached halfway, she took the arm of her now father-in-law Prince Charles.He was to “accompany” her to the altar, rather than “give away” the woman who, let’s face it, he’s only just getting to know. For Charles the last-minute role was perhaps a godsend, placing him centre stage where the presence of his ever-strong mother might have eclipsed him.Not to mention the ghost of his ex-wife, always painted as the touch-feely parent to his seemingly more remote style.For, although it’s been 20 years since Diana’s death, how could anyone in the same situation not think of their mother and muse and how she would have savoured being there?And how could even the ­hardest of Republican hearts not have felt a small pang of regret she wasn’t?After all, in the middle of it all was the very human story of a young man who stole the nation’s hearts when forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at the tender age of 12.On his engagement, Harry was asked what Diana would have thought of Meghan. He smiled and said: “They would have been thick as thieves. I think she would have been over the moon — jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends with Meghan.”Indeed she would. Diana always took great pains to make sure her sons knew not everyone’s life was as privileged.So she would have adored Harry’s choice of bride for her normality and independence.He could have had his pick of socialites but he chose a normal woman who has grafted and earned everything she has.The downside is that, unlike poshies who are as badly behaved as the rest of us but keep it to themselves, Meghan’s unedited life is ripe for scrutiny.Diana would have understood and done her utmost to support her.

In return, it’s plain to see she has Harry’s unconditional devotion, and that they’ll make fine parents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot. So he just sits there going ‘vroom vroom’.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation. Only four bothered to turn up.The threat of vast fines might finally make them sit up and listen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She is making big money with an exclusive TV interview.”Samantha regularly tweets about her half-sister, and her Twitter profile includes candid photographs of them growing up together.Meanwhile, Doria Ragland, 64, has remained largely silent after it was revealed her daughter had fallen in love with a Prince, with the American mum jetting into the UK to be by Meghans side ahead of the wedding.The mum was quickly welcomed by the Royal Family, with the bride even thanking her new in-laws for their kindness to her mum.But Samantha appears to be unimpressed at Doria, who is believed to be filming an interview with Oprah Winfrey while they are both in London.Oprah, 64, arrived at the wedding alone after securing the landmark chat with Meg’s mum. The US talkshow icon later described the day as “extraordinary”.A royal source revealed: “The plan is for Doria to film part of her interview while Oprah is in London. That’s why she was invited to the wedding. There’s huge secrecy about what the interview will involve and when it will air.“But both Doria and Meghan felt it was critical for Oprah to be at the wedding to really understand.“Oprah is an icon in the US media and a role model to African American women.

Going well.Another said: So @GNRailUK have been badgering us for weeks about the timetable changes. Obligingly, I get up and out earlier to catch altered train and oh look. Cancelled. As is the one prior. Bravo @GNRailUKA GTR spokesman said: We are introducing the biggest change to rail timetables in a generation and, as we have been informing passengers, we expect some disruption to services in the initial stages.This is a significant logistical challenge as we make rolling incremental changes across more than 3,000 daily services.We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused during the initial stages of the timetable change.The improvements we are making will lead to a significant boost in capacity with a 135 increase in services across the GTR network immediately.Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash described the chaos as Meltdown Monday.He said: The union is picking up reports from both Northern and GTR of a hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet, which has reduced the Monday morning journey to a nightmare for many passengers.It is our members dealing with the anger at the sharp end, not the well-paid top brass from Arriva and Govia who are responsible for this Meltdown Monday on our railways.Both of these companies have sought to compromise safety and access by hacking back on critical staff and it is no surprise to RMT that they cant be trusted with the massive logistical challenges of bringing in new timetables.Frankly I wouldnt trust the private train operators to run a bath, let alone our vital rail routes. After Virgin/Stagecoach were kicked off the East Coast last week, its time for the rest of these racketeers to be sent packing as well and for our railways to be run by the public sector as a public service.More than four million trains across Britain were rescheduled from Sunday in the largest timetable change in living memory.The number of alterations is seven times larger than normal due to the introduction of new trains and services following billions of pounds of investment.The shake-up is designed to increase overall frequencies and reliability, but some passengers will find their regular journeys are no longer possible.The new GTR timetable was developed from scratch and was designed to tackle existing issues by extending stop times at busier stations and increasing turnaround times at destination stations.Many of the timetable changes are a result of the £7 billion invested in the Thameslink programme in the South East, including rebuilding London Bridge station, new trains and track improvements.There will be almost 400 additional GTR trains every day.Some passengers in a number of locations complained they will be served with fewer or slower services, including in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Kent, East Sussex and Surrey, where many people pay several thousand pounds for annual season tickets to London."},{"url":null,"title":"audi stops middle m53 motorway","story":"The cocky driver of the Audi convertible brakes repeatedly in front of the recovery truck, before making obscene gestures on the M53.Footage filmed by a passenger in the recovery truck driven by Bill Houghton sees him finally lose patience and scream at the Audi driver: Ill smash you to f****** bits.The dispute, which took place on Saturday afternoon between junctions 8 and 10 in Cheshire, is thought to have been caused by the Audi driver becoming enraged at the slow speed of the recovery vehicle.In the video, the Audi driver cuts in front of the recovery truck and gestures for him to pull over.He then moves back in to the fast lane and which point an enraged Mr Houghton yells threats and calls the Audi driver a b*****d.The Audi gets in front of the recovery truck and brakes sharply before accelerating away.Incredibly, the Audi then stops completely in the left hand lane.

yacht","story":"The Chelsea owner, 51, and his business dealings are under the spotlight once again after his UK visa was delayed amid a government probe into Russian oligarchs living in Britain.Known for his “stealthy” and often ruthless business acumen, Abramovich has amassed a fortune of £9billion thanks to his close ties to the Kremlin and in particular President Vladimir Putin, 61.After meeting future business partner and Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky in 1993, Abramovich was able to forge alliances in the Yeltsin government including with Putin.He and former car dealer Berezovsky were able to buy Siberian oil giant Sibneft for less than $200 million (£148 million) in an auction which is alleged to have been rigged.But it was his relationship with then-Prime Minister Putin which enabled him to consolidate Russia’s warring aluminium industry between himself and a small number of other oligarchs.The mega deal – made in February 2000, three months before Putin became the country’s President – would transform Abramovich’s life and business portfolio.A Putin biographer described the ex-KGB spys relationship with Abramovich as being similar to that of a father and favourite son, reports The Times.In 2016, it was revealed that the billionaire was able to gift the Kremlin strongman a £25million superyacht named Olympia.Putin is said to have maintained the luxury boat using state funds.In 2012, a high court judge said Abramovich had “very good relations” and privileged access to Putin.The oligarch, who purchased Chelsea football club in 2003, was in court after Berezovsky accused him of forcing him to sell his Sibneft shares for a cut price.But despite acknowledging Abramovich’s strong relationship with Putin, judge Mrs Justice Gloster said his influence on the government’s decision-making was “limited.She said: There was no evidential basis supporting the contention that Mr Abramovich was in a position to manipulate, or otherwise influence, President Putin, or officers in his administration, to exercise their powers in such a way as to enable Mr Abramovich to achieve his own commercial goals.I am prepared to assume that, on occasion, President Putin may have taken his views into account when making decisions, but the suggestion that Mr Abramovich was in a position to pull the presidential strings was simply not borne out by the evidence.She ruled in the Chelsea owners favour calling him courteousand frank while accusing Berozovsky of being an inherently unreliable witness.Orphaned at four, and adopted by his uncle, Abramovich left school at 16 and briefly studied engineering before joining the army.After working as a mechanic, he started his own business becoming a market trader in 1980s Moscow selling toys such as rubber ducks.At the age of 25, he is accused of “procuring financial gain by means of fraud” by allegedly forging three million kilograms of diesel in 1992.The fuel, carried by five railway tankers and worth 3.8bn roubles (around £400million), was “emptied and appropriated”, reports the .The rumours surrounding the diesel tankers have never been substantiated.By the early 1990s, Abramovich reportedly set up and liquidating at least 20 companies in industries as diverse as tyre retreading and bodyguard recruitment.But it was during a Caribbean holiday in 1993 where he would meet Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky and forge one of the most significant relationships of his career.Abramovich admitted in court that he paid Berezovsky a total of $2.5bn for political access inside President Boris Yeltsins 1990s government.In the mid-90s, the pair were able to buy Siberian oil giant Sibneft for less than $200 million despite the firm being valued at $15billion (£11billion) in 2003Through Berezovsky, Abramovich was able to forge an alliance with Yeltsin ally Vladimir Putin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407971109.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding official photos meghan markle prince harry

two-year-old Zalie Warren appeared to be distracted in both photographs.The toddler stared off into the distance while the other members of the bridal party posed for the camera.But while the photographs have been flooded with compliments, some fans have noticed a bizarre optical illusion in two of the snaps thanks to mirrors in the drawing room.The photographs come just days after Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in front of a star-studded crowd from the Queen to the Clooneys.The Prince, who has previously revealed that he knew Meghan was the one for him the moment they met, hadnt hesitated to propose to the US actress.And the pairs whirlwind romance came to a head over the weekend when Meghan married her very own Prince in the romantic ceremony that broke with tradition and

uniform.More than 100,000 people turned out in Windsor to greet the newlyweds as they made their way through the town after the ceremony.The thousands of people who were in Windsor in person - plus the millions of viewers who tuned in around the world - were left melting at the couples adoring relationship.From Harry whispering I missed you to Meghan when she arrived at the altar to the flowers he had picked for her bouquet the day before, every moment of the wedding was filled with the couples unique identity and love for each other.Wedding watchers hailed Prince Harry and Meghan, saying the couple had thrown the Royal Family into the 21st century with their modern ceremony that included a gospel choir and charismatic American bishop. Ingrid Seward, Editor in Chief of Majesty Magazine, told The Sun Online: Theres never been a royal wedding like in modern history.It was certainly a departure from tradition and and bodes well for the future of the modern monarchy.Their wholly modern ceremony was a far cry from Royal Weddings of previous generations and showed the Monarchy mirroring modern Britain.Mixed-race divorcee Meghan, 36, was embraced with open arms by her in-laws — a welcome not extended to previous newcomers to the family."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407462240.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the

progressively worsening shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing - was cut in half when patients were treated with dupilumab.And those taking the placebo suffered at least one asthma exacerbation a day.Although the drug significantly reduced asthma symptoms for all patients, dupilumab worked particularly well in patients with high numbers of a specific type of white blood cell, called eosinophils, circulating in the bloodstream.For those patients, asthma exacerbations were cut by two-thirds.Lead author Mario Castro, a distinguished professor in pulmonology and critical care medicine, said: This drug not only reduced severe symptoms of asthma, it improved the ability to breathe.Thats important because these patients have a chronic disabling disease that worsens over time with loss of lung function.So far, we do not have a drug for asthma that changes the course of the disease.Current drugs for severe asthma help reduce trips to the emergency room, for example, but they dont improve lung function.For the first study, 1,900 patients needing three types of inhalers to manage their symptoms were split into two groups, one to receive dupilumab and one to receive a placebo for a year.Not only did the drug reduce symptoms, the patients receiving dupilumab showed improved lung function in a test of forced expiratory volume - a test that measures how much air a persons lung can exhale.Patients receiving dupilumab, regardless of dose, improved their lung function by approximately 130-200 milliliters greater than those receiving the placebo.Hospital visits were also down with only 3.5 per cent of dupilumab patients needing to go to A\u0026ampE compared to 6.5 per cent of the placebo group.The second study suggests patients could be weaned off strong steroids, currently used to treat asthma.Long-term use of steroids can have debilitating effects including stunted growth, diabetes, cataracts and osteoporosis.Some 200 patients who had used inhalers and oral steroids to control their asthma were recruited for the second study.Half were put on dupilumab and the other half a placebo.After a year of treament 80 per cent of those on the dupilumab trial were able cut their steroid doses in half, compared to a small amount on the placebo trial.I have patients who have had to stop working and go on disability because their asthma symptoms are so severe they can no longer function in the workplace, Prof. Castro said.Im excited about the potential of dupilumab because I have so many patients who have maxed out on available therapies and they still cant breathe. It can become a very disabling disease."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407986374.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry and meghan arrive

Charlotte.Fifth-in-line to the throne Charlotte particularly seemed to be at home in front of the camera, with the three-year-old having been on sparkling form all day.And big brother George seemed to appear slightly more comfortable as he stood with the couple, giving a cheeky grin in the snaps. Meanwhile, two-year-old Zalie Warren appeared to be distracted in both photographs.The toddler stared off into the distance while the other members of the bridal party posed for the camera.But while the photographs have been flooded with compliments, some fans have noticed a bizarre optical illusion

The Government revealed the southbound motorway in Kent would be brought to standstill by thousands of stationary trucks queuing for docks like Dover, if there are delays. Cars heading to the continent would be able to use the northbound carriageway along with vehicles heading towards London, with workers setting up a contraflow system. The plan - similar to Operation Stack, the procedure implemented by Kent Police and Highways England to park lorries on the motorway when strikes in France cripple cross-Channel ferries and Eurotunnel trains - will be ready from early next year.  It comes after ministers shelved plans for a \u0026pound250million lorry park at the size of the motorway. Britain is due to quit the EU on March 29, 2019. The latest plan was slipped out in a written parliamentary statement on “road haulage”. Confirming the move, Transport Minister Baroness Liz Sugg said: “The Department has now agreed with Highways England that this arrangement should take the form of a contraflow system which would see lorries for the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel held on the coast-bound carriageway between junctions 8-9 of the M20, while other traffic will use a contraflow to continue their journey on the other side of the motorway. “Highways England are starting the preparatory works for the scheme now and it will be available from early 2019.”  Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said: “The Government’s approach to contingency planning for lorries on the economically vital M20 link to the Port of Dover has been incompetent and disastrous. “It had to scrap an important \u0026pound250million lorry park near the M20 last year because it got the plans wrong and has wasted millions on renting space for lorries at Manston Airport which has never been used.  “A no-deal Brexit could grind the South East of England to a halt.” Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: “The Transport Secretary is right to start worrying about potential serious disruption to cross-Channel transport. “If no customs deal is reached and tariffs kick in, spot checks will start on the 10,000 lorries that go through Dover alone every day and the Channel ports will simply freeze up. “Nobody voted to see our ports grind to a halt.” "},{"url":null,"title":"aldi barbecue discount bargain","story":"NewsAldi\u0027s 3-in-1 £99 bargain pizza oven is back for the bank holiday - and it\u0027s already sold out onlineThe supermarket giant has revealed a fresh batch of BBQ SpecialBuys\u0026nbspShareByDave Masters16:42, 21 MAY 2018Updated17:16, 21 MAY 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAldi is selling a super-cheap pizza oven - but it\u0027s proving such a hot bargain it\u0027s already sold out online.

The family photos of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding day taken by Alexi Lubomirski have now been released - and just like William and Kate\u0027s official pictures, they were well worth the wait. The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex released three photos: a full family picture, a picture of the bride and groom with their little page boys and bridesmaids and a black and white picture of the happy couple.  At the same time their wedding photographer posted the picture and a message on his own Instagram page.     He said: It has been an incredible honor and privilege to document the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s inspiring journey of love, hope and family from the engagement photos, all the way through to the official wedding and family portraits on Saturday. This has been a beautiful chapter in my career and life, that I will happily never forget. Thank you to everyone at @kensingtonroyal and @theroyalfamily. With the wedding one of the most heavily photographed events of the year, he did not need to take pictures of the ceremony, but will instead have focused on the portraits. That meant he was able to attend the wedding as a guest with wife Giada. He wrote on Instagram after the big day: Went to a little wedding today ) ...... Wow.. What a fantastic, surreal and wonderful day! Amazing to experience it as a guest and even more incredible to experience it as a photographer. Felt extremely fortunate to have been there AND to share the day with my beautiful wife (@ecoshaker) by my side, who looked stunning. MASSIVE CONGRATULATIONS to the happy couple!!!!  It seems a no-brainer to pick one of the world\u0027s top fashion photographers, who has shot the likes of Lupita Nyong\u0027o, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, Kate Winslet, Victoria Beckham, and Anne Hathaway. But perhaps the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex had more in mind when they first picked Lubomirski to take their pictures. Because he is a real Prince himself and has written an etiquette guide book called Princely Advice for a Happy Life.    At age 11 Lubormirski discovered a Polish royal lineage on his father\u0027s side that dates back 500 years. It was a Princess Diaries moment of sorts but with a catch — the house\u0027s reign had ended, and Alexi\u0027s seat would be the first not to bear any of the luxury trappings associated with royalty. In one generation, everything flipped completely, he told Harpers Bazaar . I was one generation away from 500 years of history.  According to the photographer\u0027s own website: The Lubomirski family is one of the most well- known and influential in Poland’s history. They were one of the largest landowners in Europe, and their members served as governors, statesmen, senators, diplomats, philanthropists, and patrons of the arts throughout the centuries. But he adds: After two world wars and the rise of communism, the family had lost centuries of art, land, palaces, and family treasures. It was a title with no physical riches. Lubomirski’s childhood was spent between England and Botswana with his Peruvian mother and English stepfather and he studied at The University of Brighton before he became Mario Testino\u0027s photography assistant. Of working with one of Princess Diana\u0027s favourite photographers, he told Bazaar : It was incredible to sit next to Mario Testino and just watch him work. You could be sitting in front of the Queen of England watching him make her smile or Gwyneth Paltrow trying to make her feel sexy when she [wasn\u0027t feeling] sexy.  Royal wedding in pictures: Most amazing photos from Harry and Meghan\u0027s beautiful day But it was his mother\u0027s words which have guided the photographer and he said: If you are to be a prince in today\u0027s world, she told him when he was young, you have to be a prince in your heart and actions. Since then, he says has lived life according to the spirit of the William Shakespeare quote from Henry VI, Part 3 that opens Lubomirski\u0027s book, Princely Advice for a Happy Life : My crown is in my heart, not on my head. The book has gathered celebrity fans, Kate Winslet said: This beautiful book, should become a bible for all! Without spiritual fluffiness, and free from preaching statements, this is a simple book of basic, gentle ideals that we sometimes forget about.

A more flammable version of the insulation was then sold for public use, including the refurbishment of Grenfell, an investigation by BBC Panorama claims. Celotex said it could not comment because it is cooperating with the police investigation and the public inquiry. But the company has not denied any of the allegations. The RS5000 insulation gives off toxic fumes which contain cyanide when it burns. It is thought that all of the 72 people who died at Grenfell were killed by smoke. Celotex’s plastic foam insulation has been used on hundreds of other buildings around the country.   Fire safety expert Arnold Tarling said he was shocked by the allegation: “Well, words fail me. This is absolutely mind-blowing. This material is all over the place.” The alleged change in formula was not the only problem with the fire safety test that the insulation passed. The BS8414-2 test only showed RS5000 was safe to use on certain new build projects when it was combined with a specific fire-proof cladding panel. But Celotex allegedly knowingly misled buyers about RS5000. Its marketing suggested the insulation was suitable for use with other cladding panels and for tower block refurbishment projects like Grenfell, it is claimed. Neither was true, according to the BBC Panorama - Grenfell: Who Is To Blame? which is airing tonight. The company was repeatedly warned that its marketing was misleading, but it carried on mis-selling the product anyway- according to reports.

Jordyn Mavromatis, 22, was visiting a friend when she spotted the heavily-built thug snatching a handbag from a woman in the street. The fearless winger ran outside and tackled mugger Daniel O’Boyle to the floor. The crook managed to escape to a nearby car and was driven away by an accomplice.  But the pair were caught nearby and O’Boyle, 41, was jailed for 16 years for a string of robberies and GBH attack. Earlier this month Jordyn was presented with a High Sheriff Award and \u0026pound750 for her actions. Judge Michael Fowler, who jailed O’Boyle, said: “Jordyn’s actions were exceptionally quick-thinking and brave.  “As a result of her actions the horrifying experience of the victim and her children was brought to an early end. “She deserves to be proud of her actions.” Jordyn leapt into action when she saw O’Boyle wrestling with the woman in Wellingborough, Northants., last August.  The insurance broker described the incident saying: “I looked out the window and saw a man and woman fighting with two little kids around them. “The children were screaming that he was a robber.  “I knew I had to stop him but the only way I knew how to stop someone so big was to rugby tackle them. “I bent down and charged at him and I pushed him and sent him flying across the road.

Mohamed Amied Neda, 57, who lived on the top floor of the block, died from injuries consistent with a fall. His wife, Flora, and son, Farhad, were in hospital in comas after escaping from the west London high-rise during the horrendous blaze on June 14. In a recording played to the room, Mr Neda, also known as Saber, said in the last phone call he made: Goodbye, we are leaving this world now, goodbye. I hope I haven\u0027t disappointed you. Goodbye to all.  In statements read out on behalf of his brother, son and wife, Saber was described as a role model and hero.

This was when the fear kicked in, the uncertainty and the heartbreak that maybe we were not going to see or hear from Saber again. Maybe we had actually lost him.

The 61-year-old yoga instructor had a whirlwind of a week after meeting the British royal family for the first time, taking tea with the Queen and preparing to be watched by two billion people across the world. Doria accompanied her 36-year-old daughter to the chapel on the morning of the wedding, stepping out in a demure, pastel green, Oscar de la Renta outfit. While speculation hinted towards Doria walking Meghan down the aisle, she actually played a much more low-key role during the day.  But while she may not have taken in the responsibility of walking down the aisle, it seemed the day had taken its toll by the time she got back to her chauffeur-driven car to head to the reception at Frogmore House. Pictures showed her leaning back with her eyes closed, after what we can only imagine was a very early start and a hectic morning. Speculation has also been mounting since the wedding as to whether Doria will move to the UK to support her daughter on her new royal journey. One royal insider said Meghan has an incredibly close bond with Doria and values her wise counsel.  The insider added: “When she and Harry start a family it’ll be incredibly hard if her mum is 5,500 miles away.”  Described by Meghan Markle as her wonderful free-spirited mum, Doria wore her trademark nose stud as she sat opposite the Queen in the chapel.  At one point she sighed deeply and shook her head as if she couldn’t quite believe what was happening. And dreadlocked Doria, descended from African slaves who chose the surname “Wisdom”, listened intently as US preacher Michael Curry talked of the civil rights struggle.

But in the last few years it\u0027s gained a new lease of life thanks to the young royals, and it now seems to be an appealing place for many of them to call home. The Cambridge gang now live in a lavish home on the site, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be moving in next door after their wedding. The couple lived in the small two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage, but they are due to be upgraded to Apartment 1 after their wedding. It\u0027s the second biggest on the site, and work is already underway to get the lavish 21-room wing all ready for them.

He is said to have undergone surgery three days before Saturday\u0027s Royal Wedding where Meghan officially joined the British Royal Family, becoming Duchess of Sussex.   Meghan had just one member of her family there on the day - her yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland .    Despite this, US Weekly reported Meghan, 36, was not in touch with any other family members on her big day - including her dad Thomas.   The former lighting director revealed to American celebrity news site TMZ that he was watching the ceremony on TV, and found it emotional and joyful as his daughter married 33-year-old Prince Harry.  He told the site: My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy.  I wish I were there and wish them all my love and happiness.

The images showed Thomas Markle admiring images of Meghan and Harry online and being fitted for a suit. Meghan and Harry married in front of 600 guests at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday.  They were later joined by 200 of their closest friends and family for a late-night afterparty where a DJ played house music and fireworks lit up the skies of Windor.

Kensington Palace released a statement from Meghan days before she tied the knot to Prince Harry, in which she said she has \u0027always cared for\u0027 her father.

Her film career dried up throughout the 60s before she became a well-respected drama coach.

Lucy\u0027s Law is demanding a ban on the sale of puppies by pet shops and other third party commercial dealers, a trade fed by cruel puppy farms in the UK and abroad.  George Eustice, minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, gave a huge hint that Lucy\u0027s Law could become a reality, saying: “The Government considers there is merit in exploring this further”. He added that a final decision would be made after it has looked at the responses to the public consultation that closed on May 2. In a dramatic day for the campaign, Lucy\u0027s Law supporters including the Mirror handed the petition which has incredibly topped 143,000 signatures to Ten Downing Street. Campaign founder and award-winning vet Marc Abraham, standing outside Number Ten, said: “It\u0027s amazing how far we\u0027ve come with no resources, just compassion and empathy and making dogs the priority “I\u0027m incredibly proud of my team and everyone for signing and sharing the petition, change is long overdue and you are all making it happen.” The campaign is named after Lucy, a Cavalier King Charlies Spaniel saved from a rescue centre. Lucy was taken in by Lisa Garner and died in 2016.  “It\u0027s very emotional today because it\u0027s a day to remember Lucy and all she went through and but we\u0027re so close to change, it\u0027s that final push,” said Lisa, who now cares for another rescue dog, Plum Pudding. “Dogs lives are literally hanging in the balance, all the other Lucy\u0027s out there still need to be saved. “I never thought it would come as far as it has and it\u0027s all stemmed form one little dog called Lucy who I saw on a rescue centre website looking so tiny and vulnerable.” Also handing over the petition was Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine. “I\u0027ve been writing about the third party sales of puppies for 28 years and this is the best shot we\u0027ve ever had of ending it,” she said. “This is our big chance today to put right something that\u0027s been wrong for decades.”  Another stalwart campaigner in Downing Street was Linda Goodman of CARIAD – Welsh for “beloved” and standing for Care and Respect Includes All Dogs. “I\u0027m incredibly hopeful,” she said. “Sometimes it\u0027s been like banging your head against a brick wall but now it feels like there\u0027s a door in the wall.” The astonishing success of the petition triggered a debate in Parliament, led by Scottish Nationalist Martyn Day, who told how an estimated 80,000 puppies are sold through third party dealers each year in the UK. “The sale of puppies through commercial third party dealers both sustains and is dependent upon the existence of puppy farms, where puppies are bred for maximum profit and minimal regard for animal welfare,” he said. He called the Lucy\u0027s Law e-petition “probably the most popular dog welfare petition the Government has seen in all time, I would extend my congratulations to all involved.”  Caroline Lucas for the Greens added: “One of the reasons this policy is so popular is that not only does it make good sense from an animal protection point of view, it\u0027s much easier to enforce that the current situation.” Lucy\u0027s Law has cross-party support, with Labour\u0027s Ann Clwyd telling MPs: “While we carry on talking, debating and procrastinating, dogs are suffering every minute of the day. “How much longer must they wait for us to end this barbaric third party puppy dealing? “I support Lucy\u0027s Law and if you really care, you will too.” Conservative Andrea Jenkyns said: “The public remain na\u0026iumlve to the horrors of the puppy farming trade, this is why legislation is necessary, not just to protect the puppies but their mothers too, and also the public from facilitating this abhorrent trade.”  Lisa Cameron, SNP, told how Lucy was exploited to within an inch of her life as “a breeding slave” before being rescued and becoming the mascot for all commercial breeding dogs. “The voices against Lucy\u0027s Law have now gone and paled into insignificance, we are speaking with one voice today, there is universal support for Lucy\u0027s Law. “For those organisations who say \u0027we\u0027d like a ban but not now,\u0027 I say, why not now? “If we wait a minute longer, more dogs like Lucy suffer absolutely appalling consequences.

No \u0026shyunauthorised videos or pictures were to emerge of the raucous party to end all parties. Only the couple\u0027s \u0027inner circle\u0027 - an exclusive 200-strong group - was invited to the Frogmore House knees-up. But here is a rundown of every last detail to escape the English country mansion. Guests reportedly supped on When Harry Met Meghan cocktails, played drinking games, danced with George Clooney and giggled at Meghan\u0027s overexcited pet dog. Meanwhile, prankster Prince William teased Harry over his thinning hair and attached a ladder to the couple\u0027s wedding car in a hilarious royal gag. Here is how Harry and Meghan celebrated in true A-lister style.  Who danced with who? Chat show superstar James Corden, who was compering the event, reportedly instigated a dance routine which featured Prince Charles, William and Harry. A source told the Sun: James \u0026shyCorden did his best to entertain and it went down an absolute treat. He even compered a dance-off between Harry, Charles and William. Everyone was laughing because it’s something no one expected. Meghan and her mum also joined in. Then everyone danced, which really kicked off the party.  The royal couple chose the Whitney Houston classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the wedding bash. One of the 200 guests said: It wasn\u0027t \u0026shytraditional in the slightest. They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop. Hollywood actor George Clooney, 57, is also reported to have whisked Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge away for a dance. But despite being one of world\u0027s the sexiest men, he did not get his own way with Fergie, who snubbed him when he asked for a quick spin on the dancefloor. Guests were given slippers to wear when their feet were tired from dancing. Actress Troian Bellisario, wife of Meghan\u0027s former on-screen husband Patrick J Adams in Suits, posted on Instagram: How amazing is this? Because these shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. \u0026shySlippers! I’m so ready.  What food and drink was served? The black-tie evening party was a sit-down dinner for 200 people. To provide the food, Harry and Meghan hired Clare Smyth, Britain\u0027s top chef and the first woman to hold three Michelin stars. The sit-down dinner was organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. Guests were told to dress to the nines for a night of old-fashioned glamour and gallons of Pol Roger champagne.  A source told the Sun: There was a glass marquee for the dinner, festival-themed stalls and bars outside, with different themed drinks. There was a gin vermouth cocktail created for Charles and Camilla, who are both massive gin fans apparently. Also on the menu were candyfloss and \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 as midnight snacks, while one source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry\u0027s red hair, named \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027. Dozens of pizza boxes were spotted being hauled into in Windsor Castle on the night of the reception - but it later emerged they were for press accredited crew on the grounds. Who won the drinking games? The bride\u0027s US heritage was marked with the American drinking game beer pong, where players throw table tennis balls into cups of beers which their opponents then have to consume, according to reports. A reception insider said Serena Williams played the game like it was tennis.  What music did guests dance to? Celebrity DJ Sam Totolee, who was hired by Rod Stewart and Uma Thurman for their wedding receptions, was on the decks. Actor Idris Elba also took a turn at DJ\u0027ing, with a playlist filled with soul classics, 1960s R\u0026ampB and 1980s dance hits. A DJ who slipped his business card to Harry during a visit to Brixton also hinted that it worked and he secured the coveted commission to play at the do. Jevanni Letford posted a photograph Windsor with the caption: Calm before the excitement. At one point a grinning Harry is said to have turned to his guests, asking: \u0027Can anyone play the piano?\u0027 before Sir Elton John gave a moving medley of four hits - Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.  Who gave a speech? Harry is reported to have told friends: You are the people that make \u0027me\u0027 me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry. Now I’m going to hand over to my far better half… Meghan then gave a speech in which she thanked Prince Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a warm welcome into the royal family. In Harry\u0027s speech, he said he was looking forward to spending the rest of my life with Meghan. But it was brother William, 35, who brought the house down in a joint speech with Harry’s best pal Charlie van Straubenzee.  They teased the groom about his thinning hair and told Meghan she was the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. One guest told the Sun: William managed to strike just the right balance between hilarious and solemn. He did mention their late mother, Princess Diana, and said how proud she would have been of her younger son. He said he was proud of Harry too and welcomed Meghan as the sister he never had and the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. But when he and Charlie got going, it was hilarious. They teased Harry about his growing bald patch and Wills said it would become as bad as his. It was some bash.  Proud dad Charles gave a speech at the earlier reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle. Talking about the man his son had become, he said: My darling old Harry, I’m so happy for you. Harry also gave a speech at the earlier reception. He moved guests to tears as he enthused about his beautiful wife, saying: We make such a great team. He is also said to have told Meghan, whose father could not attend the wedding because he was ill, that she navigated everything with such grace. Guest Suhani Jalota, who founded Mumbai charity Myna Mahila Foundation that Meghan visited last year, told Glamour Magazine the prince said: I’m so lucky to call this beautiful woman my wife now.  Was Meghan\u0027s dog at the reception? Meghan made sure her Guy played a part in her big day yesterday. And her beloved beagle proved to be one of the highlights of the night as he entertained wedding reception guests. The pet pooch had revellers in stitches as he caused chaos, running all over the place lapping up any spilled canapes. Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex, brought Guy to Britain with her last year when she relocated from her home in Toronto.

The charismatic US preacher brought a flavour of Meghan\u0027s homeland to the ceremony with his powerful speech at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, on Saturday. His dramatic monologue raised a smile - and a few eyebrows - in the church, but the Queen remained straight-faced throughout. And Editor in Chief of Majesty Magazine Ms Seward said the Queen would have loved Bishop Curry\u0027s unorthodox delivery. Mainly because she was such a huge admirer of the late American evangelist Billy Graham.  The author told the Sun: The Queen has always enjoyed clergy that make her laugh - though not in public - and I suspect she will at some later stage provide some of her renowned mimicry of the occasion. She certainly enjoyed the company of evangelical US preacher the late Billy Graham who she met in 1956. He preached in her private chapel at Windsor on many occasions and even listened to her practise one of her Christmas speeches. Graham, who died earlier this year, had a friendly relationship with the Queen and was frequently invited by the Royal Family to special events. He first met the Queen in 1955 and preached at Windsor Chapel at her invitation the following year.    Their friendly relationship may have been because they shared a traditional approach to the practical aspects of the Christian faith. According to Ms Seward, the only reason the Queen did not smile at Bishop Curry\u0027s speech was likely to be because she never smiles in church. As the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the monarch is deeply religious, and feels she must remain stern-looking. Bishop Curry - the first black presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church - gave an address titled the Power of Love at the service and spoke of poverty and justice. We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way, Bishop Curry quoted.  And he said it was a real joyful thing to bring diversity to the ceremony.  He said: It was a real joyful thing because there was a sense in which you had the fullness of the church represented in many respects. Bringing everybody together, Bishop Curry said, happened today, in different ways, different songs, different perspectives, different worlds and all of it came together and gave God thanks. The speech was a lengthy one, with Bishop Curry appearing to tell himself to bring it to a close towards the end when he looked at the couple and said: We need to get y\u0027all married. Asked whether the address was planned or off-the-cuff, the Archbishop of Canterbury interjected, saying: Let\u0027s have an honest answer. It was planned and I thought it was going to be six minutes, Mr Curry said. It was a little longer than that because there were pauses in there, he added to laughter from the Most Rev Justin Welby.

Harry and Meghan chose fashion photographer Alexi Lubomirski to take these official photos of their big day. In a black-and-white photo, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are shown in a romantic pose sat on steps of the east terrace of Windsor Castle. In a second image, Harry and Meghan are pictured with members of the royal family, including the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, the only member of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s family to attend her big day, also stood proudly alongside her daughter. The bride\u0027s adorable six bridesmaids and four page boys are also in the photo, and also take pride of place in a third image looking happy relaxed as they surround the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The stunning images showed off Meghan\u0027s Givenchy bridal gown to perfection - designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female Artistic Director at the historic French fashion house. The British-born designer said: It is truly an honour to have been given the opportunity to collaborate with Meghan Markle on such a remarkable occasion.  Lubomirski caused a stir with his stylised engagement photos of Harry and Meghan, where the then bride-to-be opted for a partly sheer, embellished dress. With the wedding one of the most heavily photographed events of the year, Lubomirski attended the wedding as a guest with wife Giada, before taking on the huge responsibility of chief photographer later in the day.  He wrote on Instagram: Went to a little wedding today ) ...... Wow.. What a fantastic, surreal and wonderful day! Amazing to experience it as a guest and even more incredible to experience it as a photographer.  Felt extremely fortunate to have been there AND to share the day with my beautiful wife (@ecoshaker) by my side, who looked stunning in her MASSIVE CONGRATULATIONS to the happy couple!!!! In statement Mr Lubomirski said: It has been an incredible honour and privilege to document The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s inspiring journey of love, hope and family from the engagement photos, all the way through to the official wedding and family portraits on Saturday.  This has been a beautiful chapter in my career and life, that I will happily never forget.  It seems a no-brainer to pick one of the world\u0027s top fashion photographers, who has shot the likes of Lupita Nyong\u0027o, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, Kate Winslet, Victoria Beckham, and Anne Hathaway. But perhaps the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex had more in mind when they first picked Lubomirski to take their pictures. Because he is a real Prince himself and has written an etiquette guide book called Princely Advice for a Happy Life.  A Kensington Palace spokesperson said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would like to thank everyone who took part in the celebrations of their wedding on Saturday. They feel so lucky to have been able to share their day with all those gathered in Windsor and also all those who watched the wedding on television across the UK, Commonwealth, and around the world. Their Royal Highnesses are delighted with these official portraits taken by Alexi Lubomirski and are happy to be able to share them today. They would also like to say thank you for all of the generous messages of support they have received.  The official pictures of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding day come seven years after those of Kate and William - who posed in Buckingham Palace\u0027s Throne Room. Prince William married Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011, with the Queen giving them the titles the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Their bridesmaids included The Hon. Margarita Armstrong-Jones, Eliza Lopes, Grace van Cutsem, Lady Louise Windsor, Tom Pettifer, William Lowther-Pinkerton.

This whole week will be largely dry, warm and sunny with temperatures hovering in the low to mid 20s, several degrees warmer than the May average, the Met Office said.   The balmy conditions have swept in on a high pressure system, dragging in hot air from the continent, meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said.  And on bank holiday Monday, temperatures in most places will easily climb into the low 20s with London set for a scorching 25C, according to The Weather Channel. These warm and settled conditions should continue for most of the day, however, the outlook is more changeable for north-west Scotland and Ireland. There is also a risk of some isolated thunderstorms across central and southern England throughout the week as the humid blast arrives from France and Spain.  It will also be a wet start to the week for Northern Ireland and western Scotland, but the showers and clouds should largely clear by Wednesday. And as the days progress it will grow cooler along the North Sea coasts owing to a northeasterly wind. Mr Dewhurst said: On Sunday we had a high of 24C and that was in Sheffield, and the day before we had 23C. Usually in May we expect highs of around 17C. Temperatures in the low to mid 20s should continue for this week, with quite widespread warmth across the country. But an easterly wind will make it feel a bit cooler across the North Sea coast as we move on. UV (ultra violet) levels are generally high across the UK as well, so people should make sure they\u0027re protected from the sun.  A spokesperson for The Weather Channel also said it would also be a dry and bright run up to the holiday weekend with temperatures above normal. “High pressure will persist resulting in a cool onshore wind from the North Sea for eastern Britain and coastal areas may be affected by low cloud and sea mist at times, they said. “Inland and especially to the west, dry and sunny conditions are forecast. “In the afternoon heat, a scattering of showers and isolated thunderstorms may develop over southern Britain on most days, the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, bookmaker Coral makes it odds on at 4-5 that 2018 goes on to be the hottest year on record amid a flurry of bets.

The impact of the weather and money worries also appeared at the top of the poll, with finances also plaguing our minds when our eyes open. Others declared that checking social media and \u0027group chat\u0027 is their number one priority in the morning. It also emerged Brits are stirred from their sleep ahead of the alarm by work woes at least twice a week. Despite being a nation of early risers, getting out of bed at an average time of 6.16am on a workday, it will take 29 minutes before we feel fully awake, alert and ready to start the day.  The average adult also takes 62 minutes to get ready in the morning, from the second they wake up to the moment they step out the door, according to the study. As a result, 36 per cent spend more than half of the working week feeling rushed and pressured for time. And 58 per cent feel “overwhelmed” with the number of tasks on their to-do list when contemplating the day ahead. Worryingly, two in five of the 2,000 surveyed feel they do not take care of themselves in the morning – skipping breakfast and exercise, and forgetting to take their vitamins. A spokesperson for The New York Bakery Co, which commissioned the study, said: “Mornings can be a hectic time, especially with pressures hitting us first thing, such as getting the kids ready for school or making it to work on time.  “It seems many of us leave just enough time to get the morning essentials done, while neglecting what we see as luxuries, like making time for breakfast or a quick session at the gym ahead of the work day.” Breakfast is also the most neglected meal of the day, with seven in 10 Brits dedicating more care to lunch and dinner. In fact, just 11 minutes each day will be dedicated to breakfast each day on average. And more than one in 10 confessed they don’t have time for breakfast AT ALL due to the daily rat race. Nearly a quarter of the UK’s workforce are forced to eat their first meal of the day ‘on-the-go’, utilising their morning commute, or while at their desk. Breakfast options lacking in excitement were on the menu for most, with a third quickly scoffing a bowl of cereal and one in eight opting for a slice of buttered toast. But due to time constraints we will skip breakfast once a week in order to fit everything into our busy morning schedules.

The debate was fierce. It was The Dress but for ears instead of eyes. Even Donald Trump took a break from playing golf to pipe up.  Now, the man who recorded the sound bite has revealed what he actually said.  It\u0027s Laurel. 100 per cent.   Broadway actor and singer Jay Aubrey Jones, 64, recorded the word \u0027laurel\u0027 back in 2007. Jay, who comes from New Jersey in he US, trained in pronunciation and produced the clip for Vocabulary. He said he\u0027s been amused to no end by the debate.  I recorded my batch of words and I thought that was that, he told  Time.   I thought, well, it couldn\u0027t be that huge.

The mum-to-be, identified as Maria de la Luz, lives in Mazatlan in Sinaloa, and already has seven children. She recently showed local media an ultrasound scan which she says confirms she is pregnant with a baby girl. She said: “My legs hurt and I was vomiting and felt dizzy. “Now they have done around ten ultrasounds in a private clinic and in the (public) social security hospital. The doctors could not believe it. “They told me it is a girl. Look, you can see her little face.  If Maria gives birth, she will become the oldest verified new mother in the world, a title currently held by Spanish woman Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara, who was 66 year’s old when she gave birth to twin boys via IVF in 2006. The Spanish mother lied about her age to receive the fertility treatment in California, a move her family at the time labelled “selfish and irresponsible”. Her twin boys, Christian and Pau, were delivered prematurely by caesarean section and weighed 3.5 lbs each. Their mother died from cancer less than three years later, leaving them orphaned.

He initiated my passion for music,\u0026#8221 the 45 from Dundee said.\u0026#8220I started playing at just five years of age or so. My dad once overheard me playing simple tunes on a little toy tune percussion that I was given for my birthday.\u0026#8220My father found the musical talent in me and decided to buy me my own real accordion. My first melodies I learned through my dad were traditional Polish folk tunes.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who was born in eastern Poland and moved to Dundee in 2007, represented Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998 and said his siblings also encouraged his passion as they were very musical themselves.\u0026#8220We would spend countless nights jamming along to music together as a family, and sometimes played a few melodies for guests here and there,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I can recall one night I had to step in for a drummer that did not show up at my dad’s gig, petrified of messing up, though the encouragement from the crowd got me through it.\u0026#8220I was ecstatic at the applause I soon received and the thrill of live music. Still, to this day, I find it hard to believe I was actually able to do it. It was the overwhelming feeling that really appealed me to music.\u0026#8221Music was very connected to his Christian belief, Miroslaw said, and he often played piano or guitar and sung during prayer and worship.\u0026#8220Playing music for me is a very natural way of expressing myself to those around me,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Music connects me with other people in a very unique way.\u0026#8220I met many friends and started relationships through my music.\u0026#8220I even met my wife, Monika, as a young adolescent in a music boarding school back in the 1990s.\u0026#8220Music is a unique, universal language and can be used as a tool to express our feelings or to put a message across that can influence others in various ways.\u0026#8220It definitely can be very therapeutic. I’ve experienced this when working with my young students with special needs or disability. This helped me to understand a different perspective on teaching and helping others.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who is also known as MIREK, is one of 14 tutors at the newly-created Dundee Music Acadamy, which this weekend is offering free lessons in guitar, singing, bass, piano, keyboard, sitar, saxophone, flute, accordion and more.\u0026#8220I always wanted to share my music experiences, tips, knowledge, fancy chords, and how I managed to solve my own musical set backs with others,\u0026#8221 Miroslaw said.\u0026#8220I saw myself becoming a teacher the minute I left the music school, and was surrounded by others alike.\u0026#8220My accordion instructor, Mrs Śliwkiewicz-Cisak, set an example of how much a teacher can help and improve the musical experience for someone else.\u0026#8220It’s a treasure to have this kind of teacher who encourages you to become an independent learner and is able to motivate you to keep going in difficult times. She was the main factor that really pulled me into teaching others.\u0026#8220As a teacher or instructor I not only help students to progress in their musicianship or instrumental skills , but also have a huge impact on their personality and help to shape their character. Seeing my own student’s progress and a smile on their face is the biggest reward any teacher can get.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0004b7cc0-745x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people nurses across dundee and tayside celebrate international nurses day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNursing staff across Tayside marked International Nurses Day.

Ross County to secure Fraser Fyvie on a two-year deal.The 25-year-old missed the second half of the season with a serious knee ligament injury.Even so, with his contract up at the end of the month the Staggies had been keen to poach him from Tannadice as they battle to get back up to the Premiership next term.The Tangerines, however, have persuaded the former Aberdeen, Wigan and Hibs man to stay with them.They recognised it was with him anchoring their midfield they played their best football this season and were determined to keep him.“Fraser’s performances and professionalism were clear to me when I became manager and he is an important player for us,” said gaffer Csaba Laszlo.“Him signing is excellent news as we build our squad ahead of the 2018/19 season.”Fyvie himself made it clear his first option was always to stay where he was.“I am delighted to continue my career here at United.“I was enjoying my football last season, and the club has been excellent during my rehab,” he said.“As I continue towards full fitness again, I cannot wait to get back out playing for United.”Fyvie’s stats for last season show why United were so desperate to hang on to him.Fifteen of his 17

Tangerines.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9b8f2158c-e1526636734395-837x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united signing spree set to kick off this weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are closing in on the first of what could be as many as 17 signings over the summer.Such is the extent of the planned overhaul of the Tangerines squad, they’re set to continue beyond the start of the season in July.So far no clues as to who’s on the wanted list have been forthcoming from Tannadice.But the Tele understands talks with at least two targets are at an advanced stage and deals could be struck over the weekend.Dunfermline pair Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark could be on the verge of joining up.While United have declined to confirm their interest in Clark, the 26-year-old’s proven scoring record at Championship level is something of which they are aware.And despite interest in him from the Premiership – St Mirren have also been linked – a determined effort to get him to Tannadice appears to be ongoing.Ex-Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon is also on their radar and he could be fixed up soon.With other identified targets, the process could take longer.While the departures of 14 players means replacements are needed, and soon, as much time as is needed to ensure the right quality is obtained for next season will be taken.With the season just over, a number of players and agents are on their summer break and that will delay some business. In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing. Before he agreed to turn out he did check we have XXXL shorts for him to wear.”The opposition is made up of fans who’ve bid to play against their past heroes.

the chance to stay with them as he battles for fitness next season.The 25-year-old suffered a serious knee problem when he picked up a bizarre injury in the Premiership play-off quarter-final victory over Dunfermline at Tannadice earlier this month.He suffered knee ligament damage as he jumped in delight to celebrate Scott McDonald’s equaliser early in the second half of the second leg that United went on to win 2-1.With the one-year contract he signed when joining up from Falkirk last summer up at the end of the month, that put a question mark over his future with the Tangerines.But manager Csaba Laszlo is sticking by the man he made No 1 late in the season.He has been told a new deal is waiting for him to sign.Even if the former Turkish youth international decides his long-term future lies elsewhere, United will see he is put through his operation and provide the facilities for him to complete his rehab programme.That process is likely to take until the end of the year at least but he did enough in 13 first-team games this season for United to be more than happy to keep him.With the other first-team goalie, Harry Lewis, returning to parent club Southampton at the end of his season-long loan, at least one of the as many as 17 signings made this summer will be an experienced No 1.Meanwhile, the latest discount period for season tickets for the 2018/19 campaign comes to an

his goalscoring prowess in his fourth appearance for the top team, netting an important goal at Hamilton in a 2-1 victory.That strike also spelled the end of his season, however, as he was caught on the knee by Accies midfielder Darian MacKinnon, who hurt himself in the process.Curran, meanwhile, was a real stand-out for the U/20s all season as they finished second in the Development League.The Australian made eight appearances for the first team in the last campaign, very much impressing against Partick Thistle, in particular.Both have their current deals coming to an end this summer.Meanwhile, Dundee have been linked with a move for Partick Thistle left-back Callum Booth.The 26-year-old could be brought in to replace the departing Kevin Holt and Jon Aurtenetxe with the squad bare in the left full-back department.That all depends on whether Partick can keep themselves in the top flight with the former Hibs man free to leave if the club get relegated.n the club have

Record for the number of people wearing sunglasses in one location – using #SunnyDundee specs.Sizzling plans to put the current record in the shade have been backed by the campaign group.Organisers of Westfest approached the group about the idea of using the yellow sunglasses emblazed with #SunnyDundee.Campaign manager Jennifer Caswell, from Dundee – One City, Many Discoveries, said she would never have thought about making a record-breaking attempt when the campaign started in April.She said an estimated 5,000 #SunnyDundee glasses have already been distributed.Dundonians wearing the glasses have been pictured basking in the sun both at home and abroad, including New York, Singapore and Austria.Westfest, which is expected to welcome more than 10,000 revellers on Sunday June 3, could be the ideal location for the record attempt.Jennifer added: “Westfest organisers approached us about the idea.“Given there are more than 5,000 shades out there, we would certainly encourage revellers who have a pair to bring them along.“The campaign has been incredible so far.“Dundee has really got on board with it, especially taking pictures and uploading them online.“We’ve seen pictures from Austria recently on social media.“Throughout the whole campaign, I would never have envisaged a record-breaking attempt.“I’ve been down to Westfest in previous years and it’s a great atmosphere and a great idea.”A Westfest spokesman said: “All of us are hugely excited by the prospect of attempting to break a record for wearing sunglasses.“We can confirm we are investigating the possibility and are in the process of contacting Guinness World Records to find out the exact world record as it stands as we try to arrange an official attempt.“Westfest has previously basked in sunny weather.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
