W.A.T.C.H. President Joan Siff advised parents to shop \u0027defensively\u0027 and not be lulled into a false sense of security because a toy is made by a familiar brand  One example of a product included the W.A.T.C.H. that has an elaborate, and alarming, warning is the Nickelodeon Nella Princess Knight Pillow Pets Sleeptime Lite W.A.T.C.H. says the toy has small felt-like accessories attached to it that if removed pose potential ingestion hazardsIt also said only two products listed on the nonprofit\u0027s \u0027worst toy\u0027 lists from the five years prior were recalled, and those two had already been pulled before W.A.T.C.H. released its list.James Swartz, a trial lawyer who serves as W.A.T.C.H.\u0027s director, responded by pointing to a list of dozens of toys that have been recalled or pulled from retailers\u0027 shelves from the early 2000s all the way back to the 1970s, in part by the group\u0027s efforts.And he said providing detailed warning labels \u0027doesn\u0027t absolve\u0027 toy makers from needing to simply design safer items.\u0027They\u0027re trying to shift the responsibility to parents and consumers,\u0027 Swartz said. \u0027They\u0027re really shirking their responsibility.\u0027One example of a product included the W.A.T.C.H. that has an elaborate, and alarming, warning is the Nickelodeon Nella Princess Knight Pillow Pets Sleeptime Lite, of which the group warned:\u0027These soft, plush Pillow Pets Sleeptime Lites project colorful night-sky images to make night-time fun. Marketed for infants as a nightlight for baby’s room, remarkably the package cautions that the product is not intended for use in a crib. \u0027Nella is adorned with small, felt-like flower and heart-tag accessories which, if removed, present potential ingestion hazards. Additionally, the manufacturer identifies a battery acid leakage hazard.\u0027  The group says the Black Panther slash claw has the potential for eye and facial injuries Swartz also highlighted Hasbro\u0027s retractable plastic claws for Marvel\u0027s Black Panther, an item featured on this year\u0027s list. The toy gloves come with a warning they should not be used to hit or swing at people.\u0027When you call it a slash claw, there\u0027s likely one thing a child is going to do with that claw,\u0027 he said.As for the Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel Supertstar Blade, the group said:\u0027W.A.T.C.H. OUT! Young children are encouraged to power up with this Super Ninja Steel spring-loaded plastic blade, with the potential to cause facial and other impact injuries.\u0027 A Cabbage Patch Kids ballerina doll that made this year\u0027s list is marketed to children ages two and above, but includes a removable tutu and headband that can be a choking hazard, Swartz said.

Members of the Cabinet each visited No 10 for a personal briefing on what is in the deal.Ministers were able to see most of the deal in a private \u0027reading room\u0027 last week - but not the most sensitive parts about the Irish border.What if ministers do not agree? If Mrs May has miscalculated her position, rebellious ministers could have resigned on the spot - potentially destroying the plans at the very first hurdle.The Prime Minister can probably survive one or two resignations - but a mass walkout would almost certainly finish her. What happens if they do? The Cabinet will reconvene today to formally discuss and accept the deal.MPs order the Government to publish legal advice on any...Age checks on internet porn are delayed AGAIN until next...Share this articleSpecial Cabinet, today What will happen? The Cabinet will assemble in Downing Street this afternoon to formally make a decision about whether to adopt the plan.Britain\u0027s most senior minsters are likely to have an extensive and frank discussion about the terms of the deal. The meeting, in Downing Street\u0027s Cabinet Room, will be the last opportunity to make clear criticism and disagreement. What if Cabinet cannot agree? Anyone who cannot agree to the plan or who attacks it after will be expected to resign or face the sack.Much like after the one on one meetings, no inidual resignation will sink the Government but a raft of people quitting could collapse the Government. Chances of no deal would rocket as there is little time to negotiate a new deal. What if there is agreement? At the end of the meeting, Mrs May will likely sum up and ask her Cabinet to endorse the plan.Once the Cabinet has agreed, they are all bound by a \u0027collective responsibility\u0027 to defend it in public. If an agreement is reached, the Prime Minister is expected to hold live televised press conference and the full 500 page orce deal will be published.        The Cabinet (pictured in July) will assemble in Downing Street tomorrow afternoon to formally make a decision about whether to adopt the planEmergency EU Summit, Brussels, late NovemberWhat will happen? If the orce package is agreed between the two sides, it will need to be signed off by EU leaders.EU council president Donald Tusk will convene a summit where formal approval will be given by EU leaders. This is expected sometime between November 22 and 25.Will the whole deal be agreed? The Brexit deal is due to come in two parts - a formal orce treaty and a political declaration on what the final trade deal might look like.The second part may not be finished until a regular EU summit due on December 13-14.Assuming the negotiations have reached an agreement and Mrs May travels to Brussels with her Cabinet\u0027s support, this stage should be a formality.What if there is no agreement? If EU leaders do not sign off on the deal at this stage, no deal becomes highly likely - there is just no time left to negotiate a wholly new deal. The so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in the UK Parliament, December 2019What will happen: A debate, probably over more than one day, will be held in the House of Commons on terms of the deal.It will end with a vote on whether or not MPs accept the deal. More than one vote might happen if MPs are allowed to table amendments.The vote is only happening after MPs forced the Government to accept a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Parliament on the terms of the deal.What happens if May wins? If the meaningful vote is passed, there will be a series of further votes as the withdrawal treaty is written into British law.It will be a huge political victory for the Prime Minister and probably secure her version of Brexit.What happens if she loses? This is possibly the most dangerous stage of all. The Prime Minister will have to stake her political credibility on winning a vote and losing it would be politically devastating. Brexiteers do not want to sign off the orce bill without a satisfactory trade deal and Remainers are reluctant to vote for a blind Brexit.She could go back to Brussels to ask for new concessions before a second vote but many think she would have to resign quickly. Ratification in the EU, February 2019 What will happen? After the meaningful vote in the UK, the EU will have to ratify the agreement.The European Parliament must also vote in favour of the deal.

At 11pm on March 29, 2019, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union, two years after triggering Article 50 and almost three years after the referendum. Exit happens at 11pm because it must happen on EU time.If the transition deal is in place, little will change immediately - people will travel in the same way as today and goods will cross the border normally. But Britain\u0027s MEPs will no longer sit in the European Parliament and British ministers will no longer take part in EU meetings.Negotiations will continue to turn the political agreement on the future partnership into legal text that will eventually become a second treaty. Both sides will build new customs and immigration controls in line with what this says.

He introduced human frailties in Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk.As the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book.     Lee and actor Chris Hemsworth arrive at the Los Angeles premiere of Thor at the El Capitan Theatre on May 2, 2011 in Hollywood          Lee (L) and actor Chadwick Boseman at the Los Angeles World Premiere of Marvel Studios\u0027 Black Panther at Dolby Theatre on January 29, 2018 in Hollywood          Actor Robert Downey Jr. (L) and Lee attend The Los Angeles World Premiere of Marvel Studios Doctor Strange in Hollywood, CA on Oct. 20th, 2016          Chris Evans and Stan Lee attend the premiere of Marvel\u0027s \u0027Captain America: Civil War\u0027 in Los Angeles in April 2016He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.Lee hit his stride this decade when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life. Lee scripted most of Marvel\u0027s superhero comics himself during the \u002760s, including the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel\u0027s publisher and editorial director four years later, 72million copies of Spider-Man were sold.Lee also published several books, including \u0027The Superhero Women\u0027 in 1977 and \u0027How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\u0027 the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.

He filmed a cameo in every Marvel Studios film, with Venom (pictured above) being the most recent          Lee\u0027s death came just one day after he tweeted a photo of himself in his WWII uniform for Veterans\u0027 Day. He served during the war writing for training films before going back to MarvelCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.The first big-budget movie based on Lee\u0027s characters, \u0027X-Men,\u0027 was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130million at North American theaters. \u0027Spider-Man\u0027 did even better, taking in more than $400million in 2002. A Marvel movie empire would emerge after that, one of the most lucrative mega-franchises in cinema history, with the recent \u0027Avengers: Infinity War\u0027 grossing more than $2billion worldwide. In 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe film shave netted over $17.6billion in worldwide grosses. Born December 28, 1922, in New York, he grew up a fan of \u0027Hardy Boys\u0027 adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, and got a job at Timely Comics after graduating from high school.Within a few months, the editor and art director quit, leaving the 17-year-old Lee with creative control over the company, which grew and was renamed Atlas Comics and, finally, Marvel. Lieber changed his name, thinking Lee would be used for \u0027silly little comics\u0027 and his real name would be reserved for novels.His early work largely reflected popular movies - westerns, crime dramas, romance, whatever was the rage at the time. He worked for about 50 cents per page.After a stint in the Army during World War II, writing for training films, he was back at Marvel to begin a long and admittedly boring run of assembly line comic book production. Lee\u0027s direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry\u0027s most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to head Marvel Productions, an animation studio that was later purchased, along with Marvel Comics, for $50million by New World Entertainment.As sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.In 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel\u0027s one-time rival. DC Vice President and Publisher Paul Levitz had nothing but praise when the agreement was made.          The creative dynamo, who revolutionized the comic book, has helped make billions for Hollywood by introducing human frailties in Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk. He is pictured on the red carpet in 2004  \u0027With his artistic collaborators at Marvel, Stan co-created the richest imaginary universe a single comics writer has ever built,\u0027 he said.The dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films and DVDs.In the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \u0027Webisodes\u0027 of comic-like action. Stan Lee Media also sought to reach out to Web-savvy youth through deals with pop artists the Backstreet Boys and Mary J. Blige.The company went bankrupt, and three men were indicted for allegedly defrauding the business in a check kiting scam. Lee wasn\u0027t implicated.After that initial failure, Lee formed the successful Pow! Entertainment company to launch animated Internet-based projects.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/13/09/05769C9D000007D0-6383599-image-a-1_1542102036716.jpg","title":"Poldark creators new TV drama expose corruption ego greed Sir Philip Green","story":"    The creators of Poldark are producing a new television series based on the rise of Sir Philip Green.

We won\u0027t protect Europe if we don\u0027t decide to have a true European army. \u0027We have to have a Europe that can defend itself alone - and without only relying on the United States in a more sovereign manner.\u0027We should protect ourselves when it comes to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\u0027That last remark angered Trump, who met with Macron on Friday last week and tweeted before the meeting: \u0027President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.\u0027Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidizes greatly!\u0027 The French government insists that Macron meant Europe needs to protect itself from decisions the US makes - such as withdrawing from the missile treaty - and not from an invasion, though Trump seems to have interpreted it differently.Shortly before Merkel spoke, Trump rekindled the feud on Twitter, writing: \u0027Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia.            Trump lashed out at Macron\u0027s comments on Twitter last week, calling them \u0027very insulting\u0027 ahead of a meeting between the pair          Trump and Macron\u0027s spat marks a significant falling-out for the two world leaders, who had shared a cordial friendship despite their differing views\u0027But it was Germany in World Wars One \u0026amp Two - How did that work out for France?

Patton\u0027s 3rd Army and were keen to get to work.Patton\u0027s original plan called for the city to be surrounded but not liberated for fear it would slow the Allied advance down and be too costly.However, de Gaulle insisted that his men be allowed to lead the charge, telling Patton that he would give the order himself if necessary.Patton conceded, and in the end his fears proved ill-founded. Despite Hitler giving orders to defend Paris \u0027to the last man\u0027, resistance was weaker than expected. Many Nazi guards abandoned their posts as they came under attack from both outside the city and from resistance fighters within.General Dietrich von Choltitz, commander of the German garrison, also disobeyed Hitler\u0027s orders to blow up Paris\u0027s landmarks as the Allies advanced, refusing to be responsible for levelling the so-called City of Light.French and US troops entered the city on August 24, and fearful that the Americans would beat him to the city centre, De Gaulle ordered his men to fight through the night.By the morning of August 25, his 2nd Armoured Division had reached the centre, and by the end of the day - fighting alongside the Americans - Paris was free of Nazi rule.

Marketed for infants as a nightlight for baby’s room, remarkably the package cautions that the product is not intended for use in a crib. \u0027Nella is adorned with small, felt-like flower and heart-tag accessories which, if removed, present potential ingestion hazards. Additionally, the manufacturer identifies a battery acid leakage hazard.\u0027  The group says the Black Panther slash claw has the potential for eye and facial injuries Swartz also highlighted Hasbro\u0027s retractable plastic claws for Marvel\u0027s Black Panther, an item featured on this year\u0027s list. The toy gloves come with a warning they should not be used to hit or swing at people.\u0027When you call it a slash claw, there\u0027s likely one thing a child is going to do with that claw,\u0027 he said.As for the Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel Supertstar Blade, the group said:\u0027W.A.T.C.H.

It said: ‘Britain’s commitment to freedom of religious expression is one of our most important values. We call on you to make a clear and proactive statement that Britain would welcome a request for sanctuary here.’          Mrs Bibi, pictured with two of her five children, was jailed for nine years after a row over a cup of water.

So Asia was sent by her co-workers to draw from the local well. After she drank using a utensil from which everyone was to quench their thirst, some of the women refused to drink from it.They were Muslims and she was Christian, an infidel. Therefore the cup was now haram – unclean to them. It has been reported they even claimed the well was defiled because Asia had drunk from it.That is when her real troubles began troubles that would put her in jail for nine years under the threat of death and now, on release, to fear for her life.The approximately 2.5million Christians in Pakistan are largely descended from low-caste Hindus who were converted by British missionaries during the Raj. Many did so to escape the prejudices and oppressions of the Hindu caste system. Now their descendants find themselves trapped in poverty and fear by a different kind of strict religious hegemony.In recent years, their vulnerability has only increased thanks to the rise of militant Islam.Blasphemy laws introduced by Islamist President Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in the Eighties, have been used as a stick to subjugate non-Muslim minorities. The most significant in this instance is Section 295c of the Penal Code, passed in 1986. Anyone found guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed would face a mandatory death sentence.Asia and her family were the only Christian household in her village, and therefore already vulnerable. Previously she had been harassed to convert to Islam. But the day she drank from the well there was an argument with three other women during which it was alleged religious insults were swapped. A ‘fight’ took place.Five days later the local imam, Mohammed Qari Salim, became involved – and not as a peacemaker. He used his position – and the loudspeakers of his mosque – to whip up hatred against Asia, who was beaten by a mob chanting: ‘Death to the Christian.’ He also filed a blasphemy complaint to police.‘They tried to put a noose around my neck so they could kill me,’ Asia later said of her assailants. But before she could be lynched she was arrested under Section 295c.Her husband and children went into hiding, having received anonymous death threats. He told the BBC: ‘They say, “We’ll deal with you if we get our hands on you”. Now everyone knows about us, so I am hiding my kids here and there. I don’t allow them to go out. Anyone can harm them.’Asia was charged with insulting the Holy Prophet and the Koran, allegations she has always denied. She then spent 18 months in jail on remand.She said the allegations were made up by one village woman who had a long-standing grudge against her. Such score-settling is a common abuse of the blasphemy laws, according to human rights campaigners.In November 2010, at a district court, Asia became the first woman in Pakistan to be sentenced to death under blasphemy laws, and was told to pay a fine equivalent to £2,180. A female farm worker in Punjab earns around £2 a day. At the court, a mob chanted: ‘Kill her, kill her.’ Asia was put on death row under 24-hour surveillance – for her own protection.The death sentence caused outrage outside Pakistan – Pope Benedict called for clemency – but delight among the country’s religious hardliners. Imam Salim, who helped bring the case against her, said: ‘Any Muslim, if given the chance, would kill such a person. You would be rewarded in heaven.’ He said he burst into tears of joy when the sentence was passed.Meanwhile, a cleric in the city of Peshawar offered a reward of £4,000 to anyone who killed Asia if she escaped execution.Some official voices spoke out on her behalf. One of the most important and impressive was the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, a long-time critic of abuses of his country’s blasphemy laws.He visited Asia in jail and said he would ask the then president, Asif Ali Zardari, to pardon her. The governor said Asia told him she had not disrespected the Holy Prophet and claimed she was sexually assaulted and dragged through her village by a mob.That sealed his fate.A few days into the January of 2011, he was gunned down by his own bodyguard, shot 27 times in central Islamabad. The killer was hailed a religious hero by many in Pakistan, and when in 2016 he was hanged for the murder, Islamist mobs went on the rampage in towns across the country. His funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000 mourners.Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan’s minister for minorities and himself a Roman Catholic, also protested against Asia’s conviction and sentence. He had been receiving death threats from Islamist groups including the Taliban and Al Qaeda for years. His outspoken support for Asia only served to precipitate the inevitable.Less than two months after Governor Taseer’s death, Mr Bhatti, 42, was driving through Islamabad when his car was riddled with bullets. He died in hospital.            Ms Bibi has been banned from leaving Pakistan by the government, which has placed her life at considerable risk as some religious leaders have placed a large bounty on her headHe had foretold the manner of his death in a video that was released after the assassination. Speaking to the camera he said: ‘I believe in Jesus Christ who has given his own life for us, and I am ready to die for a cause. I’m living for my community... and I will die to defend their rights.’With Asia behind bars, attacks on her fellow Christians increased in frequency and ferocity.In 2013, a twin suicide bomb attack on a church in Peshawar killed around 80 people. The following year in Lahore, bomb attacks on churches killed 14 and wounded 70. Christians celebrating Easter in Lahore in 2016 were hit by a suicide bombing that killed 70 and injured 340, while a church attack in Quetta last year caused dozens more casualties.A new hard-Right Islamist party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was established, calling for blasphemers to be killed and their murderers celebrated.Meanwhile, despite the grave threat to their safety, Asia’s supporters fought on. In October 2014, her appeal to the Lahore High Court against her conviction was dismissed and the sentence upheld. The following summer, the Supreme Court suspended her death sentence while the appeals process ran its course.Then, on October 31 this year, three Supreme Court judges, led by the Chief Justice, quashed the blasphemy convictions and death sentence. One said: ‘Blasphemy is a serious offence, but... a conclusion is inescapable and irresistible that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.’While Asia expressed her delight from her cell, Islamists took to the streets, bringing towns and cities to a halt. The TLP party called for the judges to be killed.Having praised the Supreme Court decision and the ‘rule of law’, Imran Khan caved in to the extremists and reportedly agreed to bar Asia from leaving Pakistan, and even have the verdict examined by another court.This caused international outrage, not least from his ex-wife Miss Goldsmith (the mother of his children). She tweeted: ‘Three days after a defiant \u0026amp brave speech defending the judiciary, Pakistan’s gov caves in to extremist demands to bar #AsiaBibi from leaving Pak, after she was acquitted of blasphemy – effectively signing her death warrant.’Asia’s lawyer, Saif ul-Malook, had already fled the country, fearing for his life. His client is now in limbo, having been flown from her jail to the capital. ‘Asia Bibi is completely secure at a safe place in Pakistan,’ a foreign ministry spokesman said. ‘She can go anywhere she wants to, she is a free national ... if she wants to go abroad, no harm in it.’But it is clear that if she is allowed to leave there will be further fury from Islamist protesters – which means the moral credibility of Mr Khan is now in question as her fate is decided.Will he let Asia go, or will he pander to those who would keep her in Pakistan where it is likely she will be hunted down and killed?    "},{"url":null,"title":"What earth possessed liberal Lord Lester","story":"Perhaps the strangest thing about Lord Lester’s allegedly very strange seduction technique is that this outwardly sane, worldly and highly distinguished man could have possibly envisioned it ending in success Perhaps the strangest thing about Lord Lester’s allegedly very strange seduction technique is that this outwardly sane, worldly and highly distinguished man could have possibly envisioned it ending in success.The 82-year-old married Liberal Democrat peer not only seemed to think an elegant women’s rights campaigner three decades his junior could be talked into becoming his mistress, but also decided the best way to pursue this ignoble aim would be to crudely proposition her.That, at least, is the claim made by Jasvinder Sanghera, whose testimony to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards has mired the veteran parliamentarian in a sex scandal.She has accused Lester, to quote the conclusions of a nine-month investigation, of being responsible for multiple incidents of ‘unwanted touching’, including groping her in his car and the kitchen of his £3 million South London house, and of persistently making sometimes revolting ‘sexual comments and offers’ to her, ‘even after she clearly objected’.After repeatedly rebuffing him, Sanghera says he then decided to offer her a ‘corrupt inducement’ to submit to the creepy advances, saying: ‘If you sleep with me, I will make you a baroness within a year.’Finally, when all else had failed, Lester stands accused of turning nasty: threatening to ‘see to it that I never had a seat in the House of Lords’, before using his power and influence to ensure she was dropped from the guest-list for important parliamentary meetings.For any public figure to indulge in such sleazy behaviour would be deeply unedifying.Sports scientist, 33, develops a brain tumour the size of an...Share this articleFor the supposed perpetrator to be a distinguished Left-wing barrister — an architect of the famous 1975 Sex Discrimination Act, and a man regarded (in the words of a newspaper profile) as the ‘Godfather of human rights legislation’, who has spent his life campaigning for minorities, especially women — it is surreal.Yet just such a conclusion was this week reached by the powerful Lords Committee for Privileges and Conduct, which found that Lord Lester of Herne Hill became so ‘obsessively attracted’ to the younger woman that ‘he completely lost all sense of judgment and propriety’.It recommended that he be suspended from the Upper House until June 2022, the longest parliamentary suspension of the modern era.          That, at least, is the claim made by Jasvinder Sanghera, whose testimony to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards has mired the veteran parliamentarian in a sex scandalIts decision was laid out in a 130-page report concluding the claims made by Sanghera, who has waived anonymity, are ‘more likely than not’ to be true, on what was described as ‘the balance of probabilities’.Before coming to this ruling, the Committee spoke to ten witnesses. Six of them helped prop up the case against Lord Lester, who continues to dismiss every allegation of impropriety as a ‘pack of lies’. Four spoke in his defence.The events in dispute date back to 2006 when the peer contacted Sanghera to ask for help to pass a Private Member’s Bill that would make forced marriage a civil offence.On paper, it represented a terrific opportunity. Jasvinder Sanghera, who grew up in a strict Sikh family in Derby — before running away as a teenager to escape such a marriage herself — has spent 25 years campaigning relentlessly on the issue. In 1993, she set up a charity called Karma Nirvana to champion the rights of women in minority communities, having seen her sister Robina commit suicide in order to escape an abusive spouse.The award-winning organisation set up refuges in Derby and Stoke, runs a helpline which offers advice to around 600 women a month, and has lobbied against everything from so-called honour killing, to female genital mutilation, to the failure of authorities to deal with Asian grooming gangs for fear of ‘rocking the multicultural boat’. For her tireless work Sanghera, now 53, was awarded the CBE.   She has accused Lester, to quote the conclusions of a nine-month investigation, of being responsible for multiple incidents of ‘unwanted touching’, including groping her in his car and the kitchen of his £3 million South London house, and of persistently making sometimes revolting ‘sexual comments and offers’ to her, ‘even after she clearly objected\u0027Lord Lester’s proposed Bill seemed like a victory for her campaigns, so Sanghera travelled to London to help draft it. Yet almost immediately, she sensed a second agenda.After their first meeting, at Lester’s barristers’ chambers, she was invited to accompany him to Wildy’s, an antiquarian bookshop in Lincoln’s Inn, where, she says, he bought her valuable copies of two classics: Shakespeare’s sonnets and Anna Karenina.Initially, Sanghera, who has three children from two marriages and lives with a long-term partner, assumed the gesture was eccentric rather than romantic. But according to a statement she gave to the Commissioner, things darkened significantly a few weeks later when she met him in Parliament for a series of meetings, plus a dinner, with supporters of the proposed Bill.By the time proceedings finished, Sanghera had missed her train home from London. When Lester found out, he invited her to spend the night at his six-bedroom home in Herne Hill, South London, saying that ‘his wife wanted to meet her’.There followed an extraordinary journey in the elderly peer’s car.‘He kept repeatedly missing the gearstick with his hand and instead very firmly placed his hand on my right thigh,’ she claimed. ‘The first time it happened, I thought it must have been an accident, but when it continued, I realised it was not. I removed his hand and asked him to stop. He just smiled. He continued to grope my thigh for the length of the journey, despite my protests.’On arriving home, Lester introduced her to his wife Catherine, who made them a cup of tea, before he escorted Sanghera to a spare room.‘Once we had reached where I would be sleeping, he said it was not far from his bedroom, which he insisted on pointing out to me,’ she added.The comment so unsettled Sanghera that she went to bed clothed, and ‘scarcely slept’ all night. Instead, she phoned a friend (described in evidence as ‘T’) who told her to put a chair under the door handle to stop anyone gaining access. The friend was one of six people — including a judge, a senior lawyer and a senior civil servant — with whom she would share details of Lester’s alleged harassment over the coming months. All acted as witnesses during the recent Lords inquiry.          In her statement to the Commissioner for Standards, Jasvinder Sanghera (pictured right) said:I attended a meeting followed by a meal in the House of Lords with a number of others including NGOs and Lord Lester. By the end of the meeting I had missed my intended train. I could have caught a later train but this would have meant arriving home sometime in the early hours of the following morning. Lord Lester suggested that I stay at his home in London. I initially said no as I did not wish to impose on his hospitality, but he insisted and said he would call his wife. Shortly after this he said he had telephoned his wife who is looking forward to meeting me, that his wife was at home and that she worked in an area that related to my work, and would love to meet me. I had no reason to be concerned about staying overnight, especially with his wife present and had by that time been working with him for a few months, and so I accepted his invitation.In the car on the way to his house, he kept repeatedly missing the gearstick with his hand and instead very firmly placed his hand on my right thigh. The first time it happened I thought it must\u0027ve been an accident, but when it continued I realised it was not. I removed his hand and asked him to stop. He just smiled. I felt incredibly uncomfortable knowing that I was on the way to staying at his house. He continued to grope my thigh for the length of the journey, despite my protests.When we arrived at his house, we were greeted by his wife who had made tea for us. We chatted, and his wife told me she would bring me a cup of tea to my room in the morning. Lord Lester then said he would show me to my bedroom for the night. Once we had reached where I would be sleeping, he said it was not far from his bedroom, which he insisted on pointing out to me, saying he would not be far from me. This made me feel very uncomfortable, as his remarks and his earlier behaviour made me feel that he had other intentions notwithstanding my unequivocal rejection of his advances.I went into my bedroom and immediately placed the chair under the door I felt afraid, recalling what had happened in the car. I immediately called T, who had been a friend for many years. I was in the bedroom at this time and I told her what had happened and I felt trapped in his house. She advised me that I put the chair under the handle of the door, which I had placed as I feared Lord Lester might come into my room in the night and she suggested I leave first thing in the morning. I scarcely slept all night, sleeping fully clothed.I removed the chair in the early hours of the morning as I knew his wife will be coming to bring me a cup of tea. This she did, and I then got ready and came down to leave for home.By this time, his wife had left, it was only Lord Lester in the house and I went into the kitchen. I went over to place the crockery in the sink. It was then that he came up behind me and put his arms around my waist. I pushed him away. Again, he placed his arms around me and further up my body. I had to force myself away. He pursued me around the kitchen and I pleaded with him to stop. Once he stopped, I told him that I wished to leave. I wanted to call a cab, but he insisted that he went with me. I allowed him to, as I just wanted to get out of the house.Once we got to the train station, he told me that he had strong feelings for me. I responded by saying I did not feel the same way. I said that he should know better as he had a wife. I made it very clear that I did not feel the same way and did not want to be involved with him in any way other than professionally. He persisted and told me that he loved me and said he could not help himself. I was relieved to get my train home, feeling uncomfortable and violated by this behaviour.                         "},{"url":null,"title":"Photograph Prince Louis reveals looks just like Duchess Cambridge baby","story":"Kate Middleton, pictured left in her pram in 1982 before her first birthday, and six-month-old Prince Louis, rightHow old are you NOW, Grandpa?

At that time, multiple sclerosis had really taken a grip on me, and Stan took the time to step away from his photo shoots, sit me down and have a lovely chat. I’ll never forget, when thanking him for filling my childhood and beyond with tales of such amazing superheroes, he told me that people like me in his words, who put disability aside to help others and push through adversity, “were the true superheroes”. Those words stay with me every day. Bless you Stan for being such inspiration. tachikomaI had reading difficulties when I was in primary school back in the early 60s, but over time managed to understand the text and speech bubbles in comics more easily than pages in text in books. Thanks, Stan, for being one of the people who taught me how to read when my school couldn’t and for being one of the creators who gave me a world of amazing characters to engage with at a time when I was a pretty lonely little girl. I still read comics, but also became a voracious reader of books because of them. Madeleine WolfeStan Lee saved my life. Possibly. When I was six, a car hit me as I crossed a road (the man was on green, so I ran. Look both ways, kids!). Just before it did, I tried to jump, as Spider-Man had done in the comic colouring book I had just read. He got a bit higher than I did, having recently been bitten by a radioactive spider, but my tiny leap might have been the difference between flying over, as I did, and going under. Or it could have made no difference at all. But my point is RIP Stan, thanks for the magic. guyfmI was lucky enough to meet Stan a few years ago at a convention in London. He was clearly frail and needed help to walk and steady himself, but seemed overjoyed that so many people had come out to see him and support his work. His enthusiasm for his fans made him appear much younger than the 90+ years he was at the time. Although the meeting was brief and consisted little more of a few words, a handshake and a photograph it was an unforgettable experience. It was a rare opportunity to meet a man whose work had a profound impact on my early life and must be considered among the 20th century’s most influential writers and creators. Marc Casson, college lecturer, north WalesGrowing up in war-torn Belfast, I was lucky for two reason: the local library at the bottom of my street, and my father as a merchant seaman, bringing home a suitcase filled with American comic books, from New York, every trip to sea. I rarely attended school, for numerous reasons, but learned the love of words through Stan’s writing. I always wanted to be a writer, even though I knew I could never become one because of my working-class background. Then I listened to Stan’s advice: “The only advice anybody can give is, if you wanna be a writer, keep writing. And read all you can, read everything.” So I did, and I am! Thank you Stan, warts and all. Sam Millar, writer, BelfastMy favourite recent cameo of his was from the Spider-Man game that came out a few months ago. You tend to expect cameos in all Marvel movies but for some reason the cameo in the game took me by surprise. Even though it was an animated version rather than his actual likeness, it captured all his charm and I was grinning like an idiot when i saw it. Turns out it’ll be the last one released before his death. Fitting that it was Spider-Man. RIP Stan. dsk84A huge escapist part of my otherwise anxious and sometimes fear-driven childhood. I know he sometimes blurred the details of who created what, with Kirby and Ditko especially, but even if he just mostly left him and the others to get on with it, to later become the brash salesmanfront man, he must have been doing something right. Though he didn’t always make the best business decisions. But thank you Stan, for brightening up my young world. PP100I thought it would be nice to share my father’s memories of Stan Lee with you along with a photo of the A1 size drawing of the superhero Stan and Herb Trimpe created during a 1975 BBC Pebble Mill at One interview. Personally I am a life long Marvel fan, as are “Seymour-Man’s” grandchildren so the fact that their grandpa is not only their real life superhero but also a Stan Lee created Marvel one is priceless. The following is my dad, David Seymour’s, fond recollection of Stan’s visit to the Pebble Mill studios:“In 1975, I was a BBC reporter and television presenter working on a daily network magazinetalk show on BBC One called Pebble Mill, named after the the broadcasting centre in Birmingham. I vividly remember interviewing Stan Lee during his visit to the UK, promoting the Son of Origins, which described the creation of several Marvel Comic superheroes. Stan was a great guest both on and off the set. He was helpful, charming, talkative and inventive. It was an extended interview and Stan decided to transform me into a new type of superhero.“I was young, British, black-haired and, Stan claimed, clearly suitable for transformation. It’s 43 years ago, and I forget now what superpowers Stan endowed me with, but as we talked live on British TV, the Marvel artist Herb Timpe sketched out the the new creation: he was called Seymour-Man. I have the sketch to this day, signed by its creators, Stan and Herb. It graces one of our guest bedrooms at home in Northumberland and has always intrigued our grandchildren. Sadly, I never developed the super powers that Stan had described. But now, silver-haired, I’m still Seymour-Man.” Ben Seymour, 42, Newcastle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb48ed2cbe5e9b95bc2f6243a236b90e155d6ff/850_443_604_363/master/604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0466376def6d789b44674652fb02500","title":"why smilin stan lee was the greatest superhero of them all","story":"He started out filling the inkwells at a pulp magazine and ended up spawning an $11bn juggernaut. Our writer salutes a legend – and the musclebound crusaders who lit up his childhoodJust as lowly Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and humble Bruce Banner was blitzed by gamma rays, so every Stan Lee devotee has an origins story to tell. One minute they’re just another a puny schoolkid. The next – ka blam! – they’ve been singled out. They encounter a comic glowing radioactive on the bottom rack of the newsagent’s, or lurking at the dentist’s waiting room – and from that moment on, their lives are changed. Inside the covers, muscled freaks of nature tackle the galaxy’s biggest problems. And yet, crucially, it always felt as if these costumed titans were not so very different from the humble schoolkids who loved them.Or, to put it another way, for a generation of British fans who grew up in the 1970s and 80s, Marvel was the childhood equivalent of Beatlemania. Marvel cleared the cobwebs with the same insurrectionist force as Twist and Shout or I Wanna Hold Your Hand. It was the shock of the new, an undiluted blast of pop culture that turned the world Technicolor. These days, the Marvel universe extends across merchandise, theme parks and a seemingly endless assemblage of tent-pole Hollywood blockbusters. But back then, the kingdom was largely confined to a weekly roster of comic books. All of which was entirely fine. We’d been raised on Noddy, Blue Peter and the TV test card. Those comics alone were almost too rich for our palates.We knew who was responsible. The man was never one to duck credit. Stan Lee became our Willie Wonka, our PT Barnum, our Wizard of Oz behind the curtain. Periodically, he’d show his grinning face. But mostly he was hard at work, marshalling his crack team of writers and illustrators and deploying his super-group of un-jolly green giants and soulful silver aliens.Daredevil, Black Panther, Dr Strange, the Submariner: there were so many names, one struggled to keep up. So you had to pick your favourites and stick with them through thick and thin. For years, I maintained a subscription for both Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk. My surname was scribbled in pencil at the top of each issue and kept behind the counter at the newsagent’s each week. These comics retailed at 7p each. Even in infancy, this struck me as preposterously good value. I once wrote to Stan Lee to thank him. I don’t think he ever wrote back.Born Stanley Lieber to Jewish immigrant parents, Lee started out on the bottom rung of the pulp magazine business, filling the inkwells at Timely Comics in New York. He went on to become a brand name, a juggernaut, a one-man industry, with all that this entails. On the page, for public consumption, he was always “Stan the Man” or “Smilin’ Stan”, at once lovable uncle and creative dynamo. But from backstage came tales of a less edifying alter-ego. It was said that Lee took credit, stole fortunes and relegated key collaborators – such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko – to the role of insignificant bit players. Everybody and everything was grist to his mill, first fuelling and then burnishing his reputation as the most influential popular artist of the 20th century.How influential was Lee? Where does one begin? You can measure his success in terms of bums on seat and money in the bank. The Marvel Comics Universe films have grossed around $11bn and counting. Lee’s own net worth was put at around $80m. Except that none of this would have been possible without the stories themselves – without tales that unfolded with the snap and vigour of cinematic storyboards and came peculiarly attuned to the tensions of contemporary America (whether it be Vietnam, civil rights or the threat of nuclear annihilation).There was a darkness and a nuance to all the best Marvel characters. The Incredible Hulk, bless him, is a Jungian case study on steroids, constantly at war with his shadow. Spider-Man is a kind of weaponised adolescence, spraying sticky fluid to the four walls, while Ben Grimm (aka The Thing) is body dysmorphia made monster, a poetic soul trapped in the carapace of a musclebound roughneck. These men (Marvel’s main failing is that it did mostly do men) have the power to turn the world on its head. But they also seem as much cursed as blessed.Naturally, I kept my Marvel subscription going for years, as the price climbed first to 8p, then into double figures. And then, just as naturally, I let it lapse – moving on towards music, big books and the storm of adolescence. Except that, in the week of Lee’s death, I realise that no one ever truly moves on – first love marks you for ever. All those years I’ve spent loftily saying that the first great adventure story I read was The Lord of the Rings, and the first great teenage portrait was The Catcher in the Rye – what rubbish that now turns out to be. It was the Silver Surfer, Spider-Man and all the rest of them, too. Marvel taught me how to read, how to think. Possibly it still does to this day. Show me a glossy cover by John Buscema and I’ll start salivating.“If you want to send a message, call Western Union,” said Hollywood mogul Samuel Goldwyn, a man who believed that popular entertainment dies the moment it turns into a lecture. And yet looking back now, from the vantage of middle-age, it feels that Marvel sends a pretty glorious message to the puny kids who blunder into its universe just before the hormones kick in. It tells them that, yes, they possess super-powers. That they can impact the world, that adulthood’s an adventure. But it also says that, guess what, your life will still be a mess. Your increased speed and strength will throw up a whole new set of problems and that gaining great power brings great responsibility.In which case, the best course of action is to be good and be kind. Fight injustice at every turn. Raise up people when you see they’re in need. Listen to the angels of your better nature. That way you too can emulate Marvel’s greatest heroes, be it Spider-Man, Daredevil or Stan Lee himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb48ed2cbe5e9b95bc2f6243a236b90e155d6ff/0_2_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa3d9753def26cca69a034d7f7267edf","title":"stan lee marvel spider man black panther","story":"The man who co-created characters such as Spider-Man and Black Panther has died at the age of 95 and is celebrated in The Stan Lee Story, a Taschen book with only 1,000 copies available, each signed by the man himself"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7fee611612c94c527a76ce77021f2dd9e415a7/0_191_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d9871d4f067e60a86cf74fdb7df0a9f","title":"black friday 2018 best uk deals offers guide","story":"Preparation is key to getting the best Black Friday deals, so try this handy guide to what’s on offer in the UKThe countdown is on to Britain’s biggest shopping event – Black Friday – and with many high street retailers struggling, shoppers can expect to bag some good bargains.This year Black Friday falls on 23 November and will be followed three days later by Cyber Monday, probably the busiest day of the year for online shopping.

According to research by PwC, the average amount consumers are willing to spend on Black Friday has risen steadily over the past two years, from £170 in 2016 to £200 in 2017. Men take a bigger interest than women and also plan to spend more. More often people are buying for themselves rather than Christmas presents.Electronic and technology goods tend to sell best on Black Friday, so for electricals retailers, Black Friday is the new Christmas and has replaced the Boxing Day sales. Retailers return to full price in early December before starting their festive promotions just prior to Christmas (this is known as “twin peaks”).Here is the Observer’s handy guide to how to snap up a bargain and stay out of the red.Consumer experts advise shopping around (you can use comparison websites such as idealo or Amazon price tracker Camelcamelcamel), and checking retailers’ returns policies before buying.Here’s what the retailers are offering – we’ll update it as new deals come in.What’s happening?

The involvement of a central bank could also be seen as imposing heavy-handed regulation that would slow down transactions and raise costs.However, businesses wishing to use the underlying blockchain technology to process transactions are likely to welcome the IMF’s endorsement and the involvement of central banks in preserving the integrity of new financial systems.The Bank of England, which is watching developments in digital currencies closely, already runs the systems that process stock exchange and banking transactions, and oversees the cash and coins that a digital currency is expected to replace.Speaking at a fintech conference in Singapore, Lagarde said central banks would take over the processing of transactions while private-sector providers offered innovative services to customers.“The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments. In addition, they would offer a more level playing field for competition, and a platform for innovation. Meanwhile your bank or fellow entrepreneurs would have ensured a friendly user experience based on the latest technologies,.“Putting it another way. The central bank focuses on its comparative advantage – back-end settlement – and financial institutions and start-ups are free to focus on what they do best – client interface and innovation. This is public-private partnership at its best.”Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrency transactions, allows users to maintain a digital account and be paid in a digital currency such as bitcoins. They can use the account, or digital wallet, to make purchases without their identity being revealed.Billions of pounds of investment is going into startup businesses that offer services based on blockchain technology, which they say can be cheaper and quicker than services offered by mainstream banks.But currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have had dramatic increases and falls in value, limiting their take-up. Bitcoin has also suffered setbacks following a spate of robberies at digital currency exchanges which have left customers millions of pounds out of pocket.Sweden’s central bank has run tests and the IMF has credited Canada, China and Uruguay as also moving ahead with plans to provide a digital currency.Lagarde said many consumers were wary of using bank accounts to buy goods and services because they could be tracked by third-parties such as insurers, who could increase charges based on transactions data.She said it was legitimate to prefer digital cash but that central banks needed to have oversight to prevent customer funds being stolen and to stop abuses by criminal gangs. IMF research showed that only central banks could develop systems that would be safe enough to meet the needs of the modern user.Lagarde added: “A new wind is blowing, that of digitalisation. In this new world we meet anywhere, anytime. The town square is back – virtually, on our smartphones. We exchange information, services, even emojis, instantly … peer to peer, person to person.“We float through a world of information, where data is the ‘new gold’, despite growing concerns over privacy and cyber-security. A world in which millennials are reinventing how our economy works, phone in hand. And this is key money itself is changing. We expect it to become more convenient and user friendly, perhaps even less serious looking.“We expect it to be integrated with social media, readily available for online and person-to-person use, including micropayments. And, of course, we expect it to be cheap and safe, protected against criminals and prying eyes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c834f04bbca119557875bc5be7be300ce80d21e/0_201_4331_2599/master/4331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fd4709391fe442a9f8e537ea34396f8","title":"the dutch cities using walking to tackle issues from vandalism to broken streetlights","story":"Dutch cities are using wijkwandelingen, or neighbourhoods walks, as a hyperlocal way of improving cities, from fixing signs to adding playgrounds “This street sign is crooked,” notes Henny Koot, then stoops down to straighten it.Like many urban areas, Spoorwijk has some obvious superficial problems like damaged infrastructure, noise pollution, speeding cars and flytipped rubbish. But the Dutch are big on what they call meedoen, to participate, and with this in mind, instead of inidually complaining to the local authority or putting up with issues, the residents of Spoorwijk have found an active way to resolve neighbourhood gripes together.Every three months, locals gather to take a wijkwandeling – a neighbourhood walk. Together, they visit problematic areas and discuss what action should be taken. Any resident can turn up and take part, and about ten to fifteen participants of all ages and social groups usually come along.“Engaged citizens take care of their neighbourhood and their neighbours. They don’t feel indifferent, because they experience positive change as soon as they are asked for their ideas, suggestions and opinions,” explains alderman Rachid Guernaoui, a member of the The Hague’s city hall.I joined Spoorwijk’s June wijkwandeling. The route differs each time, and is determined by residents, who can email organisers their complaints and requests in advance or mention issues along the way.If a problem can be fixed on the spot – like straightening a crooked sign – it is. If not, a request for action is sent to the municipality via a community action list. While a single citizen may not have the time to make sure their complaint has been considered, Spoorwijk’s community group sends a follow-up after six months if their request has gone unanswered.But the walk is not all about problems. It’s also a chance to exhchange ideas, joke, laugh and discuss the neighbourhood. On my walk, as well as local residents there are two men from the nearby Laak Centraal neighbourhood who want to introduce the concept of wijkwandeling into their own district. There are people from the municipality who want to find a better connection to the community they serve, and from organisations such as Stichting MOOI, which helps people in need but also runs various cultural events. Representative Meysur Bijl talks about her organisation’s new projects, including a food festival. Spotting grapevines growing in front of one of the houses, she explains how to make sarma: vine leaves stuffed with rice, then demonstrates how to fold the leaves.After the walk, everyone’s invited for refreshments, providing another opportunity for residents to get to know each other. There are positive words as well issues raised. “Thank you so much for the new park, thank you to everyone who made it happen,” says community organiser Carlien Nijbroek.Koot takes the opportunity to pass on information about a new renovation project which will affect a nearby street. There is talk of other improvements: new benches here, a water fountain and an additional rubbish bin there. Larger projects, such as the need to lay new pipes, are being tackled as well.Although inidual wijkwandelingen are hyperlocal events, they take place in neighbourhoods in cities all over the country, making them an effective motor for change. For example, as a result of a small-scale citizen initiative, Kraayensteen, another Hague district, has been granted almost €1.9m euro for opknapping (beautifying) the local area, and Spoorwijk itself has been granted around €50,000 euro to spend on local projects.One of the most important things a city’s governing body can do is to promote “genuine dialogue, transparent city management and open communication with citizens always and everywhere,” says Guernaoui. And key to this is “taking both big and small topics as important” – an approach that the wijkwandeling movement exemplifies.Back on the wijkwandeling, a new generation of Spoorwijk citizens is already learning that speaking up can make a difference.“What are the things you don’t like in your neighbourhood?” one Spoorwijk mother asks her five-year old son. “The geese poop,” he replies.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5810fdcbb6fc232dea177268931530473ed1b57/0_49_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=738bb4f349618c205b457b56c428b273","title":"the guardian view on prince charles at 70 he was the future once","story":"On Remembrance Sunday, amid all the trappings of tradition, the British people caught a glimpse of the future. As in 2017, it was Prince Charles, rather than his 92-year-old mother, who led the nation in its public commemoration of its war dead. The prince has increasingly been deputising for the Queen at public functions for some time now. Given that the Queen’s own mother lived to 101, the transition may still be a long one. But it is another public reminder that post-Elizabethan Britain will look, and probably feel, rather different.On Wednesday, Prince Charles turns 70. Most people of that age have either retired or are winding down in some ways. Charles is different. The purpose of his life is still ahead of him. No one has prepared more thoroughly for that moment than he has. Charles has been heir to the throne for longer – 66 years and counting – than anyone in British history. If and when he succeeds his mother, he will be by some distance – William IV holds the current record at 64 – the oldest monarch on accession too.Charles at 70 is inevitably a deeply familiar figure. Perhaps it was his unhappy first marriage that meant he seemed to move from youthful gaucheness to haughty do-gooder without much in the way of middle age in between. He is what he has long been: privileged, thin-skinned, hard-working, conscientious and traditional. In many ways, including his dress sense, he is stuck in the 1950s – possibly the only member of his generation on whom rock’n’roll left no mark whatsoever. Yet his lifelong concern for the planet is not only absolutely of today – and absolutely right too – but a supreme issue for the future.Whether he ever gets the chance to be the useful king he has clearly aspired to be is uncertain now. In an interview in John Bridcut’s TV profile aired last week, Charles said he understood the clear difference between being heir and being monarch. That is more easily said than done, especially for a man who is set in his black-spider letter-writing ways. Yet it is difficult to judge how much all of that will matter now. Charles at 50 might have thrown his weight around a bit and made the monarchy controversial in ways his mother has spent a lifetime avoiding. King Charles III at 75 or 80 seems less likely to be – or to wish to be – a gamechanger.For the monarchy, Charles was the future once. But that era is slipping away. The coronation of an elderly King Charles promises to be a distinctly backward-looking event, with none of the new-era excitement of the Queen’s in 1953. The royal baton, though not the crown itself, has already skipped a generation. It was noticeable that Charles’s sons, William and Harry, were encouraged to take centre stage in Mr Bridcut’s profile. They and their families are the public face of the royals now.Post-Elizabethan Britain is as difficult to forecast in detail as post-Brexit Britain. Before we get there, there should be a public debate about the place, if any, of constitutional monarchy in this far from united kingdom in the aftermath of Brexit (if it happens). The real task of defining the monarchy for the 21st century, though, will surely fall to William. Charles would be sensible to accept this reality. As he begins his eighth decade, he should be content to be judged more for the good he has tried to do while heir, through the Prince’s Trust and Prince’s Foundation, than for his eventual and still uncertain reign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c1f7381f948ae71e38842512d3a0b77cc7450a/0_3_941_565/master/941.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eecad6a9298740d1dc1b22bdff6da37 465w","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

Research from the Sutton Trust this year found that more than a quarter of state-educated 11 to 16 year olds in England and Wales pay for private tutoring. The charity, which measures social mobility, found that in London as many as two out of five children had been given private tutoring at some point.It’s not just pupils facing public exams that are being tutored infant and junior school children are also having private tuition, sometimes from as young as five.

This is a player who had grown used to lugging the weight of expectation during an England career that will extend to a 120th cap on Thursday night. Yet the late cameo the DC United striker enjoys against the United States on his first appearance for the national team in 734 days will be different.For Rooney, this may be a throwback. A chance for the world to recall the tearaway who ripped into Turkey at the Stadium of Light on a first competitive start, or rampaged through all-comers so startlingly en route to the quarter-finals at Euro 2004 in Portugal. At 33, the body will inevitably lack the energy of youth. Time may have dulled some of the zest but the mind will be free. Liberated.It may be the perfect way to go out because, as he readily conceded, there were times when things were far from enjoyable. “There were maybe times when I didn’t enjoy it as much as I should,” he said.“That was down to the pressure I put on myself which, obviously when you’re in that mode, you don’t want to admit is there. I’ve stepped back from that now and can analyse it, and see it was there. It makes you try too hard, makes you anxious, so you don’t enjoy it as much as you should. It affects your performance, because you play your best football and put in your best performances when you’re enjoying playing. And I’m going to enjoy Thursday.”Rooney returned from the US to discover some observers, including plenty of former internationals from Peter Shilton to Stuart Pearce, questioning why a preparatory friendly three days before a Nations League match against Croatia is to be transformed into the Wayne Rooney Foundation International.The recall has devalued the occasion they said, for all that the charitable collections outside the stadium are to be welcomed. The former captain, fresh from two training sessions with a vibrant young squad, was diplomatic when contemplating an occasion 12 months in the making.Everyone, he said, is entitled to their opinion. “But whether people agree with it or not, it’s something that’s happening,” he added. “A lot of the older players, players who won the World Cup, weren’t treated as well as they should have been. As a country, we haven’t done anything like this before. It’s the first time. I hope, in 10 or 15 years’ time, we’re sat here for someone like Harry Kane, who could possibly go on and get the goalscoring record, and it will be something that happens again. The FA are trying to move in a different direction and celebrate the players who have made an impact for their country.”There was a passing denial he had gatecrashed that wedding at the team hotel in November 2016, the day after he had won his 119th cap in a victory over Scotland, and a reminder that Gareth Southgate “did pick me again, actually” after the incident.This will be it as far as his career on English soil is concerned, whether the country’s leading scorer comes on and scores a 10-minute hat-trick or barely touches the ball. There will be no loan moves from DC United, to whom he is contracted for a further three years, back to the Premier League and no late case staked to be retained for Sunday’s game against Croatia.Southgate will take the chance to tap into Rooney’s knowledge around the farewell. At some stage before the USA match Rooney will speak to the squad, or at least their younger contingent.He stands by his decision to retire internationally 15 months ago but has been welcomed back into the fold with open arms, even by the manager whose desire to turn to youth effectively curtailed his career.The former Manchester United and Everton striker said Southgate is “fearless”. “A lot of the other managers didn’t really give youth the opportunity to express themselves and come into the team and have an impact, but Gareth has done that, giving them experience but also belief they can perform well and be successful for their country.“I thought they would be good enough to have a go at a World Cup, but maybe the next one (2022) rather than in Russia. They proved me wrong on that. These players seem comfortable in each other’s company. Of the six managers I played for, while there were a few who brought in inidual young players, to bring so many through as a group and have that trust in them … he deserves a lot of credit.“But my time has been and gone. Some good games, some bad games. That’s the story of my England career. I’ll take away being the record goalscorer and representing my country 119 times and feeling immense pride at having done that.”That tally will be swollen by one, with the youngest of his four boys, Cass, watching his father in an England shirt for the first time. No pressure indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9649d70770c3a182cfc37b4098f1ce461400a925/0_356_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b0fc802f278510799d643852a68888b","title":"marko arnautovic champions league west ham exit","story":"• Austrian forward wants to compete with the best players• ‘I’m 29, so that’s the best age,’ he tells Austrian newspaperMarko Arnautovic has admitted he is ready to leave West Ham to play in the Champions League, with the Austria forward determined to compete at the highest level possible before his career is over.Arnautovic, who moved to east London in the summer of 2017 from Stoke for a then club record fee worth up to £25m, has been in outstanding form since being handed a more central role by former manager David Moyes last season, and scored 11 Premier League goals last term. He has continued to impress this season having already found the net five times in 10 matches despite West Ham’s early struggles under Manuel Pellegrini.But while he has previously insisted he is happy at West Ham, Arnautovic – who is represented by his brother Danijel – has acknowledged that he may never have a better chance of securing a move to one of Europe’s top clubs.“I’m 29, so that’s the best age,” he told the Austrian newspaper Kurier. “It’s clear that I want to compete with the best players. But in this affair I totally trust my brother.”Manchester United were linked with a move for Arnautovic in the summer but West Ham were unwilling to sell a player they consider to be a crucial member of the team. However, his brother’s words will be of great concern to the club’s hierarchy as they attempt to build a side capable of challenging at the top end of the Premier League.“He’s already playing in the Premier League and that’s where the best players are. But for a player like Marko this cannot be the end,” said Danijel Arnautovic.“He’s a big part of West Ham’s team but I think it’s possible to tease out more of him. For that to happen, he has to play for a top team. Marko is ready for the next step. A player like him should not play against relegation. He should play for the international spots.“Marko is really enjoying playing for West Ham. He loves that club and the fans. But there is still that feeling, that this cannot be the end. And everybody should understand that.”Asked if it was possible Arnautovic could leave soon, his brother added: “That’s possible. It was already very, very close this last summer.”Meanwhile, West Ham are still hopeful of signing Samir Nasri despite concerns over the France international’s fitness. Pellegrini is understood to be in favour of handing the 31-year-old a deal until the end of the season with an option to extend his stay. Nasri is not eligible to play until 1 January because of a doping ban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea4426d3e7dde818e9995d77bbfe546d0bcdd33/0_0_6371_4088/master/6371.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=635d0a3f9a4298a771315c2e2758201f 1320w","title":"coming out as working class difficulties gay","story":"I’ve left the closet twice – as a gay man, and as an academic from a working-class background. The second was at least as hardRecently a colleague asked me what it was like growing up gay in Arkansas. Even I was surprised to find I didn’t have an answer. After all, I should be an expert on that subject – and, indeed, a couple of horror stories she no doubt expected to hear are true.However, as an adolescent, my sexual orientation, dormant as I kept it, wasn’t the reason I felt queer. Right after I hit puberty, my mother and I moved to a university town from a small farm community to escape the aftermath of my parents’ orce, and in the years that followed she had to work too many hours at too many jobs for too little money to make ends meet. Periodically she entered a depression and I, in an attempt to prevent it, strove to be perfect.Though I developed many deep friendships at college, the fact of the matter was that I had a set of concerns quite different from those of nearly all my peers. They worried about flawless GPAs and gradations of the Greek system and whether or not their parents would bankroll tropical breaks. I worried about my mom’s financial and emotional survival and how I was going to get to and from Arkansas and whether or not I could find an internship that would simply pay.It wasn’t until later that I would worry about the balance and exorbitant interest rate of the credit card I had just gotten, because for now it was a relief to be able to buy dinner off-campus or a shirt on clearance without having to do mental math to make certain I could afford it.To further complicate my situation, being the first person in my family to eventually finish college, and one of only a few of us to leave Arkansas, I had now transformed myself into an alien among even my own people.For years there were these more urgent obstacles of class to navigate before I could afford the luxury of parsing my sexuality. Now that I’m a writer, now that I’m a professor, now that I’m 37 and still happily single – the fact that I’m gay is one of the least queer things about me.Because I believe in the importance of representation of minorities in the classroom, and because one’s sexual orientation typically isn’t apparent, as a senior lecturer now at Vanderbilt University – the same institution I attended as an undergraduate – I often wonder if I should come out to my students at the beginning of each semester.I envy my LGBT colleagues who are married or otherwise partnered and thus set to reveal this aspect of their identities organically – for example, by simply mentioning what they did over break and with whom. My own necessarily unprompted coming-out, as a single man, probably would land with all the awkwardness of a revelatory sit-down with Mom and Dad, which I never had with my parents.Recently, though, I realized the same need for representation in the classroom of first-generation college students – representation of those of us from the working class. A year ago, in conjunction with the university’s office for equity, ersity and inclusion, I met with a contingent of Vanderbilt’s faculty members, administrators and the president of the student body – all of us first-generation college graduates – to discuss how the university might better serve its own first-generation students, who across the country have higher rates of stress and depression, and lower rates of retention, than their peers.What I was most surprised to learn in that meeting was that nearly everyone present reported that their working-class status had had a greater impact on their experience as undergraduates – for some of them, on their entire lives – than did any other aspect of their identity, including race, gender and sexual orientation.How best then, for those of us who’ve risen from poverty to positions of power and influence, positions of financial stability, to help our younger counterparts, those who are struggling to rise themselves? We should make ourselves seen and heard. We should stand before low-income students as concrete examples of where they might go and whom they might become and what they might be. We should come out to them as working class.I only wish I had started making such bold declarations sooner. If I had, I would have learned in college that I wasn’t alone, that there were other students like me, with my particular concerns – more of them than I imagined. It wasn’t until I started writing about my life that I realized there had been some working-class backgrounds even among my friends. But much in the same way as it was when I was a closeted teen, the latent fear of being perceived as outside the norm – of never being the best simply because of who I am and will never be able to stop being – prevented me from seeing and speaking this truth, too. It prevented me from speaking it even to myself.When I come out to my students and colleagues as from the working class, I want to expand the idea of who or what a professor is, and I especially hope to give upwardly mobile students – those incarnations of my younger self – the example and language to find one another. To see one another. To be better known to themselves.Today I can’t help imagining: what if there had been someone at my mother’s tiny, rural high school, where there was no college counselor, no one to expose the children of sharecroppers to options after graduation beyond working on a farm or in a factory – what if there had been someone like me, to tell my mother she reminded me of me? To ask her, have you thought about college? Don’t worry, I’d say, you’re good enough. Don’t worry, there’s financial aid. Don’t worry, I’d reassure her, you’ll belong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d43eca1a6b41487a2dc036cf37a413ec49ad46ac/0_227_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2e3b9417f91bf80a09e554878c26884","title":"time management productivity julie morgenstern","story":"Productivity expert Julie Morgenstern was a ‘conquistador of chaos’ until parenthood forced her to get organised. What could she teach our time-challenged writer?You can’t take advice from someone too different from you. You would feel like a dog learning how to be a cat. I might have engaged politely with Julie Morgenstern’s time-management advice – spelled out in various books over the years, including this year’s parenting opus, Time to Parent – but I wouldn’t really have been listening with my whole spirit if the life she described, before her conversion to efficiency, had not been so recognisable. It was like looking in a bloody mirror.“For the first quarter-century of life, I lived in chaos,” she says. “I lived out of piles. I was always late for everything, a real time optimist. Not even time-conscious. People used to lose things in my house – they’d take off their shoes and not be able to find them when they left.”This hit a nerve. I just dropped 200 quid on a new thermostat who loses their thermostat?Such a life, she says, is never entirely unchosen: when you are always 17 minutes late for everything, constantly procrastinating because you don’t even want to start looking for a vital scrap of paper in case you can’t find it, it feels like a triumph every time you are punctual. “I felt like a conquistador of chaos,” Morgenstern says. “As much as I craved order, I was also really afraid of it. I thought it was going to squelch my creativity, make me into this restricted person.”Her road-to-Damascus moment came when she had her daughter and spent three hours trying to get out of the house because there were 18 things to remember and they were all in different places. “I said: ‘I have to get organised. I can be the hero of my own story, but I can’t do this to another human being.”Morgenstern took it very slowly: she spent six months just organising her nappy bag, before she moved on to her kitchen, her house and, ultimately, the fabric of time itself. I, conversely, want to do it all in a week, instituting one of her principles a day and becoming a functioning human who is not imposing her chaos on others by next Thursday.“The biggest obstacle we have to organising time is our perception of it,” Morgenstern says. “We think of it as intangible, relative, qualitative. But it’s impossible to manage if you think of it like that.” Instead, think of your day like an overstuffed closet. First, you need to tidy it: group like with like get rid of stuff that is broken put everything in consistent places excise things that you don’t have room for. This is quite abstract, so it is best to start with space, somewhere you use a lot. Don’t just organise a room you never go in.It felt hubristic to start with a room when the management overlord had started with a nappy bag, but I couldn’t start with a bag because I never use the same one twice. Perhaps this is part of the problem – that the house is rammed with interim hessian bags, each with one thing at the bottom (a hairbrush, a portable charger, a passport) that I never need enough to decant and consequently will never find again.I decided to start with my coat it would become ground zero of my new life. On Friday, I made an inventory for it: keys, wallet and phone in the left pocket vape, vape juice and school-authorised blue pen in the right multi-socket charging cable on the inside, with a lipstick with a tiny mirror. Never anything else, never anything missing.Reader, this changed my life. The final 25 minutes of any house-leaving event, it turned out, were usually spent with me looking for a vital missing item. Out of nowhere, I had nearly half an hour free every morning. I started saying yes to impromptu morning requests – arguing with Nick Ferrari on LBC, making pancakes – that I previously would have laughed out of town. “Research says that the average person loses an hour a day looking for misplaced items,” Morgenstern says. “I’ve been in this business 30 years and, for a disorganised person, it’s easily three hours.” She has given me the gift of three hours, one-sixth of which I have already noticed.On Saturday, I hit the Gordian knot: I couldn’t organise anything bigger than my coat because I didn’t have time and I couldn’t organise my time until I had done my space. But I had a lurking resistance deeper than time, which was the fear that this would end with me having to throw a load of stuff away. It is like calling 111 and knowing they will tell you to go to A\u0026ampE: someone will always want you to get shot of your third beige T-shirt or your second colander.Except this is not what Morgenstern wants. “It’s impossible to declutter if you’re not organised: you don’t know if you have 17 versions of that thing, you don’t know that’s the best of them. And you declutter by category, whereas you organise room by room.”With that reassurance, I had another stab at organising. Naturally, decluttering is really easy when nobody is making you do it. By the end of the day, I had got rid of an electric piano, some prunes in armagnac and loads of books that weren’t mine.“A day is a limited amount of time. We have 24 hours. You’re sleeping eight hours. Let’s say you’re spending 10 hours at work you have six hours of personal time. If you plan more than will fit, you’re just shoving things in. That haphazard arrangement, like a closet, becomes chaotic and intimidating. You don’t even look at your to-do list, you’re just freestyling, because you already know your day is impossible.”On Sunday, I started to cluster similar things. “Work” doesn’t count as a bucket because some of it you will want to do, some you will have to do, some you will dread, some will seem distant because nobody is hassling you for it, and some is very boring. Don’t ide by urgency. Figure out when in the day you feel most creative, when you feel most physically energetic, when you feel most plodding but effective. I ordered tasks by the mood they required. In the space of a single day, I had noticed the difference: a load of expense claims done, for train fares the administrators of niche organisations must have thought I had forgotten two scenes completed of a screenplay about a world where a feminist supervillain has eradicated men, due in September. I even did some ironing! I had forgotten what ironing smelled like.“Here is a revolutionary insight,” Morgenstern says. “It’s very important it comes out of eight years of research. How much time and attention do kids need to feel loved and secure? The answer is this: short bursts of five to 15 minutes of truly unided attention delivered consistently – not big blocks of time delivered erratically.”When they wake up, when they come home from school, when they are going to bed, when they get back from work (turns out this is true of adults as well as children): stop what you are doing and concentrate on them, then leave them alone to do what they want. Constantly hovering over your children, while simultaneously trying to have a fight on Twitter and find a food recycling bag, frazzles everyone.Ah, what a revolution. Finally, I could unleash my ceaseless questions – “How was your day?” “Who was annoying?” “Did anything happen that would amuse me?” “What did you have for lunch?” – and nobody minded because they knew it was time-limited and, at some point, there would be no followup.At bedtime, I managed to start reading my favourite book to my son, after months of meaning to but getting derailed by homework and looking for things. It is The Chrysalids by John Wyndham, about people who become telepathic following a nuclear apocalypse and are persecuted for it. My son said: “This just sounds like a hard-left WhatsApp back channel.” I may have missed his wonder years. If you don’t know what you are supposed to be doing, it is hard to refuse things. And – this is a bolt-on observation from me, the non-time-expert – if you have never known what you are supposed to be doing, you won’t even have the vocabulary. So, sod it, borrow Morgernstern’s: “I’d love to do it, but my time is accounted for right now.” If it makes you sound like a robot with an American motherboard, the upside is that at least you reply to people fast, rather than leaving them hanging for six weeks, agreeing, then pulling out at the last minute, which is my current MO.By Tuesday, I knew not only what that day held, but more or less the entire week: I knew that I was free to go on a school trip with my daughter. Once I was in the National Gallery, I carved out five minutes of parental eye contact to fire at her, which I used to show her the skull at the bottom of the Holbein painting The Ambassadors, explaining how you could see its nose cavity from one angle and its evil from the other.She said: “That’s not a skull, that’s a towel.”“They’re ambassadors. They would have very clean, fancy towels. Also, who takes a towel to a meeting?”“It’s in that one’s bedroom and he’s just had a shower.”I am deviating here from the time-management point, but if you think of Holbein’s core message as being that all things will crumble to dust and that the only everlasting truth is death, it brings us back neatly to Morgenstern: “How we spend our time is how we spend our life. This couldn’t be more important.”The phrase is hateful, conjuring up a self-indulgent fragility, along with hippy smells and meditative loafing. But if you banish all that from your mind and find 20 minutes, twice a day, for something that you want to do – stare out of a window, do a quiz on how well you remember the 90s, file your mini-marshmallows by sell-by date – you experience a heady sensation: “I’m doing this because I want to and I’m in charge,” rather than: “I’m arsing about because everything has got on top of me.”It is the hardest instruction, though: when you still haven’t organised your living space, when you are still routinely setting off for things 10 minutes after they started, when all your adjustments have yet to dent the impression that every day is a race against its end, it is just not that easy to e in luxurious surrender into a novel about an ice-carver who runs a kebab shop and accidentally cuts off his finger.You could spend two years creating the perfect system, but it will never last because everyone in it will change, your work will change, your priorities will change, your children will become larger, your pets will die and you will get new ones that are worse. “It’s not like you’re ever perfect: you’ll be honing and refining this for the rest of your life,” Morgenstern says. So, even a week in, I forgave myself for asking: what is the point of a quest that never ends?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/786cc71ee5781efbb32c86ae95af591cee39730a/517_831_2552_1531/master/2552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd8eaabe766b4bf316800c49e256ed7","title":"festive advertisers dump tv for online media","story":"TV ad spend expected to fall by almost £44m in final quarter, despite overall riseUK advertisers are cutting almost £44m from their TV ad campaign budgets in the run-up to Christmas, as a shift in focus to targeting shoppers on digital media could give Google, Facebook and YouTube a bumper festive season.As the annual Christmas advertising battle hots up – Burberry’s campaign featuring Matt Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas and Naomi Campbell the latest to be unveiled – TV companies are feeling the squeeze.The UK ad market will benefit from a £6.4bn marketing frenzy in the fourth quarter – £300m more than 2017 and the most ever spent in a Christmas period – but the total amount spent on TV advertising is expected to fall by almost £44m in the final three months of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"judgement day what the papers say about theresa mays brexit deal","story":"News that the prime minister has finalised a Brexit deal that she must now sell to Cabinet dominates Wednesday’s front pagesTheresa May’s Brexit deal dominated the British front pages on Wednesday – and some of those in Europe. reports that hardliners are calling on senior ministers to block the pact, splashing with the PM’s challenge to ministers – “Brexit: May tells her cabinet, this is the deal – now back me”.The Daily Mail is more succinct with the headline “Judgment Day”.

Npower was supplying the property previously. We requested to switch to British Gas and were told there was a problem. Both npower and British Gas claim they supply us and over the past year both have sent demands for payment and debt collectors’ letters. There appears to be a phantom meter and no one can agree which one is ours. During a telephone conference call last year both argued with each other over whose customer we are. Ten months ago, npower eventually admitted it was not our supplier, refunded our payments and closed the account. We thought that was the end of it and set up a direct debit with British Gas. Then npower once again began sending demands and a debt collection threat. It now claims it is our supplier – as does British Gas to whom we pay by direct debit each month. We have lived for more than a year under threat of bailiffs entering our property and are at our wits’ end. The most depressing aspect of your ordeal is that, in the glare of the media spotlight, it took the companies mere hours to clear up the confusion. British Gas acknowledged that, although it has been pocketing your money for the past 10 months, it is not your supplier. And npower discovered that it made a mistake when it asserted that you were not its customer and closed your account.The fact that both billed you using variations of your address, none of which officially exist, is a clue to the fiasco.British Gas tells me two meters were registered to the property on the national database, one supplied by npower and the other by itself. It acknowledged this should have been established far sooner and, to show its remorse, is crediting you with a somewhat miserly £60 compensation for the stress and the threats, as well as a refund of all the bills you’ve paid them. Npower has deducted £200 from the amount you owe it during the period you were paying its rival.It would be good to report that all was now sorted, except that on the letter informing you of the resolution, it still got your address wrong.• If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

They were given the chance to read the key documents, although they were not trusted to take any papers home. Further one-on-one meetings were expected to take place on Wednesday.“Cabinet will meet at 2pm tomorrow to consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps,” a No 10 spokesman confirmed. “Cabinet ministers have been invited to read documentation ahead of that meeting.”Key elements of the deal began to leak in the early evening. The UK was understood to have agreed that an independent arbitration committee will judge when a UK-wide customs backstop could be terminated, comprising an equal number of British and EU representatives plus an independent element.There will be a review in July 2020, Brussels sources added, six months before the end of the transition period, at which it will be determined if the UK is ready to move to a free trade deal transfer to the backstop or extend the transition period, possibly by a year to 2021.Ministers were expected to study the Northern Ireland specific elements in the backstop deal. No 10 sources insisted the region would not be treated differently in customs terms, although Brussels sources said Northern Ireland would have special status in the backstop in terms of the customs union and single market.Hard-Brexiters swiftly reacted negatively to the prospective deal – and indicated they intended to vote against it if it came to parliament. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group, said: “I hope cabinet will block it or, if not, parliament will block it.”Boris Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary, said he believed the deal was “vassal state stuff”. He said the UK would be bound by laws over which it had no say, which was “utterly unacceptable”.Iain Duncan Smith, when asked if the government’s days were numbered, said: “If this is the case, the answer is almost certainly, yes, because they’re in real trouble if they bring back something unacceptable to their party.”Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s Westminster leader, said the deal was not acceptable if it matched what he had heard in leaks over the past few days. His unionist party props up May’s government.Initial indications were that ministers were prepared to back May’s deal, although last night a group of Brexiters, including the trade secretary, Liam Fox, were planning to meet for breakfast to share their views ahead of cabinet.One of the ministers who saw the prime minister on Tuesday evening, Andrea Leadsom, told friends she had “a good discussion with the PM” and will be at cabinet on Wednesday to discuss the Brexit papers with colleagues. Transport secretary Chis Grayling was described by friends as “cheerful”.If the meeting concludes successfully, the government will publish the 400-page plus legal withdrawal agreement, the outline political declaration covering the future relationship between the UK and the EU and some accompanying explanatory material. May is also ready to hold a press conference in the early evening.That will trigger the beginning of the process in which May will have to sell the deal to her party, to parliament and the country and in the process maintain her premiership.A backstop is deemed necessary to avoid a hard border in Ireland if the UK and the EU cannot agree a free trade agreement by the end of the Brexit transition period in 2020. May has proposed a UK-wide backstop that would result in the whole country remaining in a customs union with the EU.The deal was concluded at lunchtime on Tuesday after May concluded that it was no longer possible to reach an improved text. The prime minister had a meeting with Raab, in which she and the Brexit secretary agreed it was time to put it to cabinet.EU ambassadors had been due to meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the European commission’s no-deal preparations. As news emerged of the tentative deal, the agenda was amended to make way for a discussion of the final compromise positions with the member states yet to see the final text.Some details of the deal were, however, filtering through from the secretive “tunnel” in which the two sides have been negotiating. “London has to say yes now,” said an EU official at the heart of the negotiations.The British team won a victory in persuading Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, that the detail of any fisheries arrangement will be in the political declaration.The backstop will also require the UK to maintain a “level playing field” with the EU on social and environmental regulation, with negotiators understood to have “heavily boosted” what that will mean with clear detail.Brexiters in the cabinet – such as Leadsom and Penny Mordaunt – had previously raised concerns that the UK must not sign up to a backstop arrangement that traps the country in a permanent customs union.Others who have voiced unhappiness in recent meetings include Sajid Javid, the home secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, both of whom are considered to be potential alternative leaders. Rumours were also swirling in Westminster last week that Dominic Raab was close to resigning amid concerns about the backstop.“Brexiters in the cabinet will have to look deep in their souls now,” one Conservative Brexit source added.If the cabinet agrees the plan on Wednesday, the EU expects to hold a special Brexit summit on 25 November, with EU affairs ministers likely to prepare the ground at an extraordinary meeting on 19 November.Parliament will then ratify the deal in a keenly anticipated “meaningful final vote” that will take place in the middle of December. One Westminster source suggested that could happen on 10 December, following at least two days of debate.Those hoping to hold a second referendum were expected to use that moment to try to win over a majority in the Commons to the idea.On Tuesday night, the leaders of the four main opposition parties in parliament sent a joint letter to the prime minister demanding that the meaningful vote be subject to amendment, allowing alternative ideas to be considered.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, Ian Blackford, the SNP leader, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, and Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts have signed a letter demanding the ability to amend, debate and vote on any Brexit withdrawal agreement.The letter, sent on Tuesday, said: “As a minimum, any motion to this House must include: the possibility for multiple amendments to be tabled, with the Speaker able to select multiple amendments to be taken before the main motion.“While we recognise parliament will have to approve or disapprove any agreement, it would be reckless to present this vote as take-it-or-leave-it without parliament being able to suggest an alternative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52486e1264f40b9d01709ba3b61984c69c9aa9dc/0_83_1719_1031/master/1719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa950bddc1f70af00bc2f6862e69678c","title":"six key questions about theresa may brexit deal","story":"Decisions that politicians have been avoiding since summer 2016 can no longer be postponedFinally, after months of procrastination, the government and parliament are reaching the point where choices about Brexit that ministers and MPs have been avoiding since the summer of 2016 can no longer be put off. Some key decisions could be taken within the next 24 hours others in the run-up to the parliamentary vote (now expected mid-December, after an EU summit at the end of November).Here are the key questions that will need to be answered soon:This matter will be resolved within the next 24 hours. The prime minister will see some ministers inidually on Tuesday night, applying basic “ide and rule” psychology. In the past some cabinet Brexiters were braver when it came to briefing about their reservations rather than acting on them, but if they are going to walk it will have to be now. There will be particular focus on those who have laid down red lines in public, such as Andrea Leadsom and Penny Mordaunt. The backstop is the mechanism that will ensure there is no hard border in Ireland after Brexit, acting as a fallback if the new trade relationship after the transition fails to deliver no hard border. There are two issues in particular where the details remain unclear. First, to what extent could the plan lead to goods going to Northern Ireland from Great Britain being subject to new regulatory checks? And second, what will be the mechanism for ending the backstop and will the UK be able to exit unilaterally?This is crucial, but it has received relatively little attention because the focus in recent weeks has been on the backstop. In particular, will the EU allow the UK to remain effectively in the single market for goods, as May wants? And what will the paper say about May’s hugely complicated – and potentially unworkable – proposed “facilitated customs arrangement”?That partly depends on the answer to the backstop question, but, on the basis of what the DUP is saying on Tuesday night, the signs do not look good.The ERG hardliners have been out already rubbishing the deal, without having even seen it. Steve Baker, one of their leaders, said recently that at least 40 hardliners would vote against it come what may. The PM hopes to contain the scale of the Tory rebellion (which at one stage was expected to reach 80 or more). But the resignation of the remain-voting Jo Johnson on Friday will probably make this difficult.Until Johnson, all Brexit resignations were “zero-sum” resignations when a Brexiter went, at least the Tory pro-Europeans could console themselves that they were winning internal arguments, and the same logic applied when pro-European ministers (such as Phillip Lee) quit. But the Johnson resignation was a “double accelerant” resignation. His move is likely to encourage both pro-Europeans and Brexiters to reject the deal. If you are mildly Eurosceptic you would not want to be seen as caring less about UK sovereignty than a liberal Tory like Johnson.On the basis of what Jeremy Corbyn is saying, it looks unlikely, but we will find out for certain over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9fbb16ae5ef4953b515703c6f5dc4da673fa488/0_280_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4fdae8d847e970d31cf6098479d4111","title":"brexit deal theresa may conservatives meet decide cabinet politics live","story":"Cabinet due to meet at 2pm to discuss draft deal agreed by UK and EU negotiatorsBoris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, says the Times report claiming that Sabine Weyand, deputy to the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, thinks the EU would “retain all the controls” under this deal (see 8.25am), reinforces his claim that it is unacceptable. Sophie in ‘t Veld, a Dutch MEP who is the deputy to the European parliament’s chief spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt, told the Today programme this morning that the proposal to keep the UK in a temporary customs union was not “part of a cunning plan of the devious Europeans to keep the UK in a customs union forever”. She explained:None of us, neither you or I, have actually read the document, but from what we hear this is going to be part of the backstop solution and a new relationship will have to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. It all depends on how the negotiations proceed. She also said the “real problem” in the negotiation was in London. She went on:The real problem doesn’t lie there. The real problem lies within the UK, within the government, within the Tory party, between the parties, because there has not been any agreement over the relationship with the EU between any of them over the last two years. That is the real problem, because if the UK had a single agreed line, backed by the majority of parties and the majority of MPs, then the whole situation would not be so unclear.The Irish government has said it does not want to see any “hardening” of the border in the Irish sea. Senator Neale Richmond, the only politician put up by the government to do media on Wednesday, also hinted that the prime minister Leo Varadkar had not seen the full text of the withdrawal agreement. Varadkar, and his deputy Simon Coveney, had a two hour tele-conference call with Ireland’s “sherpa” in Brussels last night. He has called his ministers to a specially convened cabinet meeting at 9.30 this morning.Richmond said the “priority” for Ireland was a future relationship with the UK to protect the close trading relationship and it was in nobody’s interest to see the “backstop come into play”. He told RTE’s Morning Ireland:The priority will always be that in the next transition period we can negotiate that deep and meaningful trade, customs and regulatory arrangement between the EU and the UK as a whole. That will ensure not only is there no hard border on the island of Ireland but there is no hardening of the border down the Irish sea. That’s something the government is keen to achieve and I think can achieve.Asked whether the deal was not as the DUP’s Sammy Wilson has said a “humiliation” for the UK and Northern Ireland, Richmond said that was far from the case. “There is no ambition to humiliate anyone. Whatever the deal will be it won’t be a good deal, because there simply is no such thing as a good deal,” he told RTE’s Morning Ireland. And here is Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister, making the same point that Ian Blackford was making on Good Morning Scotland.After DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson’s warning that May’s deal gives ammunition to the Scottish Nationalists, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford spoke the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme to insist that a separate deal for Northern Ireland should mean a separate one for Scotland. He said:I’ve said repeatedly to the prime minister that the one deal that can command a majority in the house of Commons is to stay in the single market and the customs union. As far as we understand things this morning it looks as if it’s going to be a different deal for Northern Ireland. Now if it is permissible for Northern Ireland to stay in the single market as part of the backstop, then of course Scotland should be given the same opportunity.Referring to the letter written last night by himself, Jeremy Corbyn, Vince Cable, and Liz Saville Roberts, calling for May to allow amendments to the proposed deal (see below), Blackford said: “I think it’s important that the normal practice is followed and I’m grateful that we’ve had this cross-party unity.”He added: “Parliament has got to have the ability to amend what the government is putting forward.” It is “not acceptable” that the government is only willing to take amendments after the meaningful vote.Blackford also reminded listeners that Scottish secretary David Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson – who is currently on maternity leave - reportedly threatened to resign if there was a differentiated deal for NI. This is what Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, told Sky News as she was leaving Northern Ireland for London. She said:It is worrying times, there’s no doubt about that. What we’ll be looking at is the text, hopefully we’ll actually get to see the text so that we can make our own judgment on that. The prime minister is very clear about where we stand on all of this. As you know we’ve written to her, she’s very clear that we cannot be separated from the rest of the UK, either in terms of customs or indeed in terms of regulatory alignment either.Regulatory alignment would mean that we would erge from the rest of the UK, we would stay in the single market, whereas the rest of the United Kingdom would not. We would have a democratic deficit insofar as we would be taking rules from the European Union and would have no way in influencing those rules.It’s a question of whether we’re separating the union – whether we are dealing with the United Kingdom in a way that leaves us adrift in the future. As the leader of unionism in Northern Ireland I’m not about to agree to that.Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter leader of the Commons, was also identified as a cabinet minister who might resign over the Brexit deal - not least because on Sunday she said the UK would have to be able to leave any customs union with the EU unilaterally, something that does not seem to be possible under the deal, on the basis of what is being reported.But this morning, speaking to reporters as she left her home, she sounded positive about what was on offer. She said:I’ve had a good conversation with the prime minister and I’m looking at the details of the deal today and I’m extremely optimistic that we’ll have a good deal, but I’m looking at the details today.Andrew Brigden MP, one of Theresa May’s fiercest critics, predicted that if cabinet ministers did not resign over the agreement more Tory MPs would demand a leadership contest.A contest would be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write to the chair of the 1922 committee demanding a change of leader.It is understood that the number submitted, including a letter by Bridgen, is close to that threshold. Speaking to BBC Breakfast Bridgen he said: Further details of this dodgy deal will come out later on. The cabinet are meeting at 2pm. Cabinet ministers with honour would resign over these proposals if they can’t persuade the prime minister to drop them. But there is not as much honour in politics as perhaps there should be. Failing that I think there will be the 48 letters in very imminently once the details of this proposal are out in the public domain. Under the rules of the 1922 committee, it would probably be Monday if the letters come at the end of this week.Bridgen admitted that he had not seen the document being discussed by the cabinet today. But he claimed that under the backstop arrangement, outlined in the document, the UK would in effect lose its right to leave the EU. He said: We are going to be stuck in the backstop forever, why would the EU ever let us out of it? So we will be in a customs union that will neutralise all the economic benefits of leaving the European Union - no ability to do free trade deals. It is exactly where the European Union want to keep us pinned.We know the prime minister likes to have a little dance, but it is clear with this withdrawal agreement she is certainly dancing to Mr Barnier and the EU’s tune, so I will not be supporting it. If I did I would not be able to look my constituents in the eye who overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union. I wouldn’t be able to look myself in the mirror either.Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, was in Downing Street this morning for a meeting with Theresa May about the deal. She arrived at about 8am, and left about half an hour later. As she left, she did not respond to questions from reporters.Mordaunt is near the top of lists of cabinet ministers most likely to resign today over the Brexit deal - although of course one of the key facts about the situation at the moment is that, as of now, no one has resigned over the deal agreed yesterday - even though cabinet ministers have seen the details.City traders are preparing for the pound to either soar or tumble once this afternoon’s cabinet meeting has played out.Sterling ‘implied volatility’ (which measures investors buying protection against sharp swings in the currency) has jumped this morning, to its highest level since the 2017 general election.It shows today’s Brexit cabinet meeting is the most significant event for the UK economy in over a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbd5d0e6a7b224f4e416a23b22d35c19648d51c/0_167_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b12edcde4ccd77fab0d799d9e320eab","title":"hip hop hull young people poverty city of culture","story":"A new documentary shows one man’s battle with poverty as he tries to bring rap – and hope – to the city’s most deprived areasTen-year-old Jess Baker (not her real name) stands at a microphone in a tiny recording studio behind a hip-hop clothing shop near Hull city centre. “My brain is all messed up,” she raps, “Music is my passion, it makes me not give up”.Running the sound desk and encouraging her as she raps is Steve Arnott, director of Beats Bus, a project running music and arts workshops for young people in the city, which tackle issues including mental health, bullying and political engagement. “The idea of the Beats Bus first came to me about five years ago,” says Arnott. “There were hip-hop workshops already happening across the city, and I’d started doing workshops for young people. But if you come from a family with no money, parents can’t afford to give their children bus fares every day to come into town.”Arnott is the focus of a new documentary following his attempts to bring creativity and self-expression to young people in Hull’s marginalised communities. The film, A Northern Soul, by Hull-born documentary-maker Sean McAllister, is set against the backdrop of 2017, when Hull was city of culture.Established in 2013 by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the UK city of culture, awarded every four years, aims to bring the kind of social and economic benefits that Liverpool got from being the European capital of culture in 2008, when it welcomed 9.7 million and its economy got a boost of more than £750m.Hull beat competition from Leicester, Dundee and Swansea to become the second city of culture, after Derry in Northern Ireland won the inaugural bid for 2013. Civic leaders in Derry say that five years on, the effects of its year of culture are still being felt. It was an economic success and has transformed the image of the city, although an audit revealed it did not deliver as many jobs as had been predicted.And last December, Coventry was chosen to be the next city of culture – and was handed £8.5m in last month’s budget to help it prepare heritage and cultural buildings ahead of 2021. The team putting together Coventry’s programme is working with grassroots organisations to ensure events are inclusive. “Austerity is still biting hard,” says Martin Sutherland, chief executive of Coventry City of Culture Trust. “The year cannot just be about a big celebratory arts festival.” As well as tracking the economic impact of the year, Coventry’s team will be analysing the social impact, including on wellbeing, isolation, loneliness and mental health.Hull’s winning bid focused on “a city coming out of the shadows”. Hopes were high for its year as a cultural hub and the potential to transform lives – more than one in three children in the city live in poverty and it is one of England’s 20 most deprived areas. Although the city of culture title does not automatically confer any monetary gain, as a result of becoming city of culture, Hull received £8.5m from the government, £3m from Arts Council England and more than £10m in lottery funding including £3m from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support its programme of events.On the face of it, Hull has reaped the benefits: its year as city of culture attracted more than 5 million people to its events and led to 800 new jobs and almost £220m investment in culture and tourism. “I knew that the city of culture would make Hull really proud,” says Arnott. “The first week was amazing, with thousands of people on the streets crying, cheering, laughing. It raised the pride in our people.”Katy Fuller, an executive producer who helped organise Hull UK City of Culture 2017, now creative director and chief executive of Absolutely Cultured, the organisation running the city’s legacy events, says nine out of 10 residents had been involved in an event during the year – either attending, participating or volunteering.Audiences from the city’s most deprived areas were included in a number of different ways, and performances did not just take place in the city centre. The city of culture organisers, Fuller says, worked with schools, shopping centres and social clubs to put performances in the heart of communities – and one of the year’s showpiece events, the Land of Green Ginger, was presented in six neighbourhoods beyond the city centre. One of the city of culture legacy programmes is supporting theatre companies and artists living and working in Hull, she adds.Yet while Arnott’s Beats Bus colleague Dave Okwesia agrees that the events raised Hull’s profile and brought in both visitors and new businesses to the city centre, he says that the benefits were not felt so much in outlying areas or among grassroots artists. While A Northern Soul is a story about Hull’s year in the cultural spotlight, it’s also a powerful counterblast to the “poverty porn” of TV programmes such as Channel 4’s Benefits Street. Arnott is shown juggling his efforts to get his Beats Bus project on the road with an arduous job in a warehouse, struggling to make ends meet as his debts mount. “In the media, political and national discourse there has been an increase in negative depictions of poverty,” says Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which part-funded the film. “It became obvious to us that we could not change laws and policies without addressing those attitudes.”Although the film focuses on Arnott, the story it tells of in-work poverty is one faced by growing numbers of people, with one in eight of the UK workforce (3.7 million people) living in poverty. “This film will resonate with everybody who watches it because this is the reality of lots of people’s lives,” says Robb. “While it tells the story of one man, it tells the story of a generation of people.”McAllister says his film is having a zeitgeist moment. Since its premiere at Sheffield documentary festival in June, Arnott and McAllister have travelled nationwide, speaking at dozens of screenings – often the film has been shown alongside Ken Loach’s drama I, Daniel Blake. The documentary will be shown to MPs this month and it is being aired on BBC2 on 18 November.Back in Hull, Arnott has secured £11,500 from crowdfunding to run the Beats Bus as a social enterprise, enabling him to give up his warehouse job and to focus full-time, with four colleagues, on running music, performance and art workshops for young people around the city.“The original idea, which we want to go back to, is approaching communities and estates where kids are knocking about on the streets because they’ve got nothing better to do,” he says. “We want to give them something better to do, give them a bit of advice and maybe stop them getting in trouble, messing about and maybe breaking the law. Youth clubs have been cut – we can be a travelling youth club.”And his ultimate aim is to take the Beats Bus project beyond Hull. “We want to branch out to take it wherever people want it,” he says. “If it works well, it can work well anywhere.”A Northern Soul will be shown on BBC2 at 10pm on 18 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fdf7ecbe5d8de7ce5bd86a100e70e74c2a6f5dc/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d4ba8cbf3bde82b6189c6f3f4c6d5c","title":"scouts to recruit children aged four and five in trial scheme","story":"Pilot project aims to close opportunity gap between poorer and wealthier childrenThe scouting movement is getting younger with plans to recruit four- and five-year-olds as part of a pilot scheme targeting disadvantaged children.The aim is to build emotional resilience and encourage independence among children from hard-to-reach families. By developing life skills at the earliest possible age, the Scouts hope to close the opportunity gap between poorer children and their wealthier peers.Three approaches are being trialled in 20 groups involving a total of nearly 300 children and their families over 12 months. If successful, the most effective model will be rolled out across the UK in 2020.The Scouts last lowered their age limit 32 years ago when children aged six to eight were admitted for the first time as Beaver scouts, a junior movement that grew to 100,000 children in five years.Today’s new mini-Scouts – yet to be formally named – are some way from Robert Baden-Powell’s original vision, trialled in 1907 on Brownsea Island in Dorset, where 21 adolescents set up camp and learned about woodcraft, boating, life-saving, patriotism and chivalry.But the pre-school scheme will be informed by the same spirit, according to the chief Scout, Bear Grylls. “We know from research that girls’ and boys’ skills, values and attitudes are formed in their early years of life. We believe that by offering early years provision we can ensure we have an even more positive impact on young people’s lives. And that’s what scouting is about,” he said.“This pilot will help us find a truly effective formula for young people aged four and five to benefit from. It’s about giving them adventure and life skills that they can develop through scouting.”The scheme is being funded by the Department for Education, which has given the Scouts £640,000 as part of an £18m investment to improve disadvantaged children’s early communications skills.The three potential options include a family scouting model with hands-on involvement from parents and carers, similar to the American and Denmark scouting model an early years unit attached to an existing Scout group, similar to the Squirrels programme in Northern Ireland and a partnership scheme delivered in different community settings to reach children from specific groups, such as looked-after children.There has been a surge in membership in recent years and the Scouts describes itself as the largest co-educational youth movement in the UK, with 638,000 members, of which 475,000 are aged six to 24 and 163,000 are adult volunteers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32bee9a83a54e2bde4201195ea3b32d8295e6ba2/2_172_3105_1863/master/3105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6b97989938e726963eca3f87366d2ff","title":"amy jones wicketkeeper england world twenty20","story":"Wicketkeeper Amy Jones says England are relieved to have finally got their World Twenty20 campaign under way and said their seven-wicket victory against Bangladesh on Monday had been “convincing”.“It’s been very frustrating with all the rain around and we’ve had to be a bit creative with training – batting under the stands and stuff like that,” Jones said. “I’m glad we managed to stay confident and wait for our chance.”For Jones, who hit an unbeaten 28 in Monday’s match and finished as England’s top scorer in the encounter, it was also a personal triumph. As England’s second-choice keeper since her debut in 2013, this is the first World Cup in which Jones will take the gloves in every match, an opportunity that was handed to her when it was decided six weeks before the tournament that Sarah Taylor would not travel for health reasons.“ I have played the odd game in World Cups and finals but as it stands it is looking like I will play a part throughout this. It is such a great opportunity for me to show everyone what I can do.”So far, she is certainly living up to coach Mark Robinson’s pre-tournament billing of her as “the best keeper in the world after Taylor”. Her glove work against Bangladesh was impeccable, including a superb ing catch to dismiss Bangladesh’s number three Fargana Hoque.Former England wicketkeeper Jack Russell is also now a fan, having tweeted during Monday’s match that she “has good technique and looks sharp and natural” behind the stumps. “I saw that afterwards, it was really cool!,” Jones said. “Obviously, he is a wicketkeeping legend so it was brilliant.”England’s next match is on Friday against South Africa, who beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets on Monday, putting them in pole position in the group.“It is looking like the South Africa game will be a big one,” agreed Jones. “They have got some very dangerous players and having played them in the summer a lot both teams know each other very well.

England’s coach believes a failure to stick to agreed protocols is undermining rugby and that attending talks on such issues is now “a waste of time.”With his side only halfway through their November schedule, Jones clearly feels the sport’s governing body, World Rugby, has a problem. “I don’t think I’ll go to another referees’ meeting in my life,” he said, reflecting on England’s 16-15 defeat by New Zealand. “It’s a waste of time. If we have a policy then we have to follow it. If we don’t follow it, then what is the point in being involved in those policies and decision-making?Jones is one of several leading figures who has been helping World Rugby to identify ways of enhancing player safety, only for numerous inconsistencies to crop up in Tests across Europe over the past two weekends.The experienced former Australia and Japan coach sounds less than keen to be involved on advisory panels. “If I’m not going to go to the meetings, I won’t know what’s said. We’ll let it take its own course. We are happy to take every decision they make. The referees have a tough job but all we want in rugby is consistency in decision-making.”Jones did not specifically mention the decision to disallow a spectacular late try by the flanker Sam Underhill against the All Blacks when the television match official persuaded the referee, Jérôme Garcès, to alter his decision. World Rugby had made clear only recently its preference for such decisions to be determined by the on-field referee unless there is “compelling evidence” for the TMO to intervene.England will be without George Kruis for their remaining two internationals against Japan and Australia because of the calf injury the lock sustained against New Zealand. Jones says Maro Itoje and Bath’s Charlie Ewels will be England’s two primary lineout callers, with Courtney Lawes and Elliott Stooke also included in a 30-man preliminary squad preparing for Saturday’s game against Japan.While Tuilagi’s medical history provides no great cause for optimism, Jones is confident the centre will make a full recovery. “We have got all the best medical advice and we believe he is moving in the right direction.”He also allayed concerns about his co-captain Dylan Hartley, who was substituted at half-time against the All Blacks. “He has got a thumb problem, so he struggled gripping the jersey of the tighthead,” Jones said. “That caused us problems in the scrum which is why we took him off a bit earlier than we normally would.“He could barely train until last Friday but he didn’t get another knock on it so he should be all right. Otherwise he is in better nick physically than he has been for a long time. By the World Cup he will be in even better nick.”"},{"url":null,"title":"talking horses bryony frost rides out claim with cheltenham looming","story":"Racing at Chelmsford was abandoned after a power failure caused a virtual blackout during the running of the third raceRacing at Chelmsford on Tuesday night was abandoned after a power failure caused a virtual blackout during the running of the third race. The floodlights at the Essex circuit went out with about two and a half furlongs to run of the feature race on the card. That seven-furlong event was declared void and the rest of the meeting called off, as the course remained in darkness.The British Horseracing Authority said on its Twitter feed: “Due to the judge not being able to verify the full result, the race has been declared void. Due to power failure, the decision has been made in conjunction with racecourse management to abandon the remainder of the meeting.”Tony Ennis was the racecourse commentator for the meeting and explained what happened. “All the power went off with a quarter-mile to go and the rest of the race was run in darkness,” he told At The Races. “It was very dark. I could just make out I think it was Florencio by a short head, but it was very tight. Two of them were involved. I couldn’t work out what the other horse was, as basically it was very dark. All we had was the back grandstand lights still on. Obviously it was almost pitch black. “The whole track was in darkness from about two an a half furlongs from home, in what was the feature race. I’ve never known anything like it. Everything went down - the lights, the commentary, the judge’s microphone.”Florencio’s trainer Jamie Osborne expressed his disappointment at the race being declared void. “I don’t think there is anything I can do,” he said. “There was a light on the winning line, but the judge said he couldn’t determine the result, so he had to void the race, which being a £15,000 race is disappointing for my owners.” The official report from the stewards at Chelmsford read: “An inquiry was held to consider if this race should be declared void. The judge was interviewed. The judge explained that due to insufficient light, he was not able to verify the full result. “The stewards were unable to view the last two furlongs of the race, and taking into consideration the judge’s evidence, the stewards declared the race void. An inquiry was held into the circumstances surrounding the failure of power.“The clerk of the course, racecourse executive and electrician were interviewed. Having heard their evidence, the decision was made in conjunction with the racecourse management to abandon the remainder of the meeting. A report was forwarded for further consideration to the head office of the British Horseracing Authority.” PAGreg Wood: Bryony Frost, very much the jockey of the moment, will be a fully-fledged professional jockey the next time she climbs aboard a horse in public, having become only the second female to ride out her claim over jumps in Britain when Marienstar, the 5-2 favourite, landed a handicap chase at Kempton Park on Monday evening.Frost’s first ride as a pro will not be on Tuesday, however, as she currently has nothing booked until the first day of Cheltenham’s three-day meeting on Friday. And how the punters will miss her, as Frost’s record on fancied horses in particular since she returned from a three-month absence due to injury in early October is exceptional.“I’m a professional now,” she said. “I’ve flown the nest. It’s now a bit of a daunting time, but I’ve got Paul Nicholls and Neil King behind me. When you have those teams behind you, they fill you with confidence.”The hard work starts now, of course, as Frost starts to mix it with the senior riders without the benefit of an allowance. Her confidence levels could hardly be any better, though, and Frost’s ride on Present Man to win the Badger Ales Trophy for the second year running at Wincanton three days ago was a timely reminder that horses just seem to run and jump for her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b445d028448ba2313c471d73e4887ed3823f25a7/0_123_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cad162e704c1e72b81b7b85a46e5406a","title":"world chess championship game 4 carlsen caruana","story":"Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana are no closer to a verdict in their world championship match after playing to a straightforward 34-move draw in Game 4 on Tuesday afternoon in London. There was added spice away from the board, though, as a clip that appeared to reveal tightly held secrets of the American challenger’s preparation was uploaded to YouTube and into the public domain.Carlsen, playing with the white pieces, delivered a surprise with the geographically appropriate English Opening, a choice he’d played only once in 37 previous classical meetings with his American rival. A predictable line followed through 10 moves until the Norwegian champion offered a novelty with 11. b4, yet Caruana, who had struggled with time in earlier games, immediately struck back with 11. ...

Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1.

The champion’s response was somewhat more glib.“Well, I’ll have a look at the video and then make up my mind,” Carlsen said with a wry smile, prompting laughter from the gallery. “We’ll see then.”Carlsen’s manager Espen Agdestein, who initially declined to address the video, later said he believed it was a mistake by Caruana’s camp in a quote reported by leading Norwegian chess journalist Tarjei Svensen.“I think this is real,” Agdestein said. “It can happen by mistake, and we’ve been close to making the same mistake. It’s more likely that it was a mistake than that it was staged.”Norwegian chess grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer said he believed the information revealed was authentic, representing a devastating setback to Caruana’s bid to become the first American to win the world championship since Bobby Fischer in 1972.“This is the opening library of Caruana,” Hammer said on Norwegian television network VG. “This was so much detail and in-depth information on an opening he has already used in the world championship match.“It is obvious that this is relevant.”Both players will look forward to Wednesday’s rest day before the best-of-12-games match, the first world title showdown between the sport’s top two players in 28 years, resumes on Thursday with Caruana playing as white in Game 5."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091d500531011bf19edca27272933387e69b1495/262_146_3751_2252/master/3751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b379f2a80f6650f8d6ff2ccc1dfd1300","title":"sri lanka v england second test day one live cricket kandy","story":"Luckily there is no need to ponder that teaser: the players are back with us. Ok, I’m going to try and move on from grammarbantzschaft and ask you to settle an argument between my wife and me that’s not about crumbs in the hummus (of course I can’t scoop it out onto a plate and then dip into it, I’m not a monster). So here goes: Vladmir Putin is 66 but ex-KGB. Could I have him? Could you have him? How many of your mates would it take? “To further the musings on the Lower Middle-Order style,” emails Damian Walsh, “here in FR we would sniff at the somewhat negative aspect of ‘Lower’ and just drop it altogether. We would however insist on the ‘Upper’ to differentiate the Upper Middle-Order from the Middle-Order. This principle can clearly be seen in the (Bas) Medoc and the Haut Medoc when one is drinking one’s claret.”Easily one of my favourite Hi-de-Hi actors. Ok, let’s try and deal with hyphens during the interval: “Surely the German compound noun formations are simply cheating when it comes to long words?” asks Steve Hudson. “Just describe anything you want to in detailed enough terms, remove spaces, et voila! Norris McWhirter comes a-running. Nothing to match up to antidisestablishmentarianism, which is a good, honest, useful word.”I’m more a floccinaucinihilipilification man oh the things we found funny in the 80s. I blame Thatcher. That’s another pretty even session. On the one hand, England’s batsmen have got starts on the other, the pitch is doing a lot, so you might expect that. On the one hand, the batsmen haven’t been done by great balls on the other, Sri Lanka have bowled well, so you might expect that. In the studio, Mahela reckons 300 is par, and England are still well short of that, so Sri Lanka will be the happier team. 60th over: England 212-7 (Curran 12, Rashid 29) Curran flows a single to cover then Rashid turns one to leg very nicely done. Danajaya then beats Curran again, on the back foot again - he needs to come forward and try to cover the spin, is what those of us who’ve played Test cricket are telling him - and a single later, it’s tea. “We could simply adopt the German approach and create a new word,” says Kim Thonger on hyphengate or hyphen-gate, “‘lowermiddleorder’, simply shunting all three words into one longer one. It would be nowhere near as extreme as this, at 80 letters, the longest word ever composed in German, Donaudampfschifffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft, the ‘Association for Subordinate Officials of the Head Office Management of the Danube Steamboat Electrical Services’.”The suffix “schaft” makes that seems like the greatest insult of all-time. 59th over: England 209-7 (Curran 10, Rashid 28) Lakmal’s looking for reverse – good luck old mate, it’s always in the last place you look, can you remember where you had it last – and struggling to extract the necessary pace. Maiden. 58th over: England 209-7 (Curran 10, Rashid 28) If England can just sneak to tea without further damage, they’ll consider this a fair session. Rashid takes another single to leg, but then, two balls later, Curran is beaten by grip and lift ... too much grip and lift. I think Dananjaya hit that one too well. This pitch reminds me a little of the one in Mumbai where KP scored that 186 - he told me that it was so vicious you didn’t really need to worry about the spin and bounce so much, as it stopped the bowlers attacking the stumps. Yeah, easy. 57th over: England 208-7 (Curran 10, Rashid 27) Sri Lanka will feel this should be closer to over than it is, but the reality is that you rarely knock over a team with this many good batsmen for below 200 (ok, yes you do, when it’s this team). L’havdil elef havdalot, if you nailed West Indies top order, Logie and Dujon would make runs, and we all remember Andy Bichel. Anyway, Rashid batters Lakmal’s loosener through cover for four, then tries again and ends up with one.“Does dress attire determine the email address your given at the  (eg flip-flops and shorts)” emails Sam Barratt. “Could a trilby and slacks see an end to your suffix?”You have no idea of the extent to which you’ve nailed me. Literally. I’m sure we’ve discussed this before, but I don’t believe in footwear that isn’t trainers or the aforementioned, nor do I believe in torso coverings that aren’t t-shirts, hoodies, jumpers or sweatshirts. 56th over: England 203-7 (Curran 10, Rashid 22) Curran eases onto the back foot and drives ... tries to drive ... and edges high towards first slip! Who can’t snaffle! It would’ve been a screamer, high into the left hand, and instead it yields three. Rashid then flicks a single to leg, and that’s another useful over for England. 55th over: England 199-7 (Curran 7, Rashid 21) A single apiece, and this is now z more than nifty partnership, 28 off 54. “John Starbuck is right,” reckons Adrian Armstrong . “No need for hyphens when using ‘lower middle order’ as a noun phrase. It’s like ‘late Middle Ages’. But if it’s used as an adjective, hyphens all round: ‘a lower-middle-order batsman’.”54th over: England 197-7 (Curran 6, Rashid 20) Deirdre is enjoying this, the muscles around his clavicles doing all sorts. He comes down again, getting right to the pitch, and drives hard through cover and to the fence. He then adds a single, and Dananjaya squirts one out of the side of the hand rather like a ball delivered by a mate of mine at university - it goes nowhere near the batsman, but unlike that mate, he saves himself 20 years of abuse by holding it down and getting the next one down the other end. 53rd over: England 192-7 (Curran 6, Rashid 15) Rashid has a look at Pushpakumara, then twinkles down the track and clouts him down the ground for six! “Havsummathat”, he’d have said were he in a comic. Yerman almost comes back with the final ball of the over, pushing one through, but Curran’s inside edge - into the pads - saves him. 52nd over: England 185-7 (Curran 6, Rashid 8) Dananjaya into the attack, replacing Perera, and two of England’s real top-order milk him for three singles. “I’d go with lower-middle order,” tweets Simon Evans. “Compound adjective I reckon. In other news, do you think 230 or so would be a decent hit on this wicket?”I don’t think I know what a compound adjective is, but middle-order is hyphenated according to the Graun’s style – make of that what you will – and though you could say ‘lower middle-order’, meaning the lower part of the middle-order, you’re actually talking about the lower-middle bit of the order, which is why I went for all three. In other news, I reckon England want 250 from here, but 230 would be competitive. 51st over: England 182-7 (Curran 5, Rashid 6) Rashid looks pretty comfy here – I wonder if, as a spinner who can bat, he mids facing spin less than other batsmen. Curran takes one to leg, then he bunts to cover. 50th over: England 180-7 (Curran 4, Rashid 5) England up the tempo, Curran taking two singles and Rashid one before the latter whips a brace away to backwards square. He does not wait to be asked, a trait especially useful on a track such as this. At what point do we reckon this is a decent score? I think we might be close. “How easily doth monotony become pure joy?” asks Finbar Anslow at the Rogoredo Station - is that somewhere from This Is a Low? Apparently not. “A dull, foggy Milanese morn transformed into pure pleasure by a student cancelling, a great cappuccino and a West countryman at the crease.”There is little better than waking up to Test cricket. I’m struggling to think of anything, but let me know. 48th over: England 175-7 (Curran 2, Rashid 2) The pitch is offering a heady mix of turn and skid, and when Cuzza – surely that is his nickname, just as Rashid’s is Deirdre – leaves Perera’s fourth delivery, he’s exceedingly relieved to see it pass off stump. Maiden, but with a leg-bye. 47th over: England 174-7 (Curran 2, Rashid 2) Rashid is quickly off the mark, coming down to bang to long on, then Curran adds another and he responds. “You don’t need hyphens at all for ‘lower middle order’,” reckons John Starbuck, “but you could initialise it as LMO, pronounced Elmo. This will save you valuable typing time.”I’m not sure. I’m almost certain “middle” needs to be connected to something, and you could make a case for either or both of the two other words. An uge wicket! Another sweep from Buttler, this time a reverse ... but Pushpakumara took pace off, and he can only impart the top edge, picking out backward point! This isn’t a “that’s just the way I play” scenario - he’s played a brilliant innings that the rest will do well to match, on a pitch which demands you get your runs quick, before it gets you. 46th over: England 171-6 (Buttler 63, Curran 1) NOT OUT! Curran, who is clearly just one of those lucky expletives - Joe Root is another - to whom good things just happen - kept his foot down long enough, only overbalancing once the bails were off, getting back before Dickwella could get middle stump out of the ground. As it were. 46th over: England 171-6 (Buttler 63, Curran 1) Perera finds more turn! Loads of it! And Curran, reaching and stretching, can’t find the pitch, pressing forward, face over pad, overbalancing, and off come the bails! Stumping review imminent...45th over: England 170-6 (Buttler 62, Curran 1) One off the over again, shoved to cover by Buttler. “May I humbly suggest a new team song for England in Sri Lanka?” emails Kim Thonger. “The Mary Poppins Dick van Dyke classic... ‘Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-ee. A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be’.”I’m loath to give those Zany Army types any ideas at all. 44th over: England 169-6 (Buttler 61, Curran 1) So this is the partnership really England need a hunnert out of these two at the very least ... and that does not seem likely when Perera finds drift, spin, grip and leap. This Test is not long for this world. One from the over, a sweep from Buttles, and the pitch is turning so much the batsmen will feel they’ve no choice but to play shots. Morning all. At what point do we credit England with reinventing the way we think about Test cricket, using their least reliable batsmen to accumulate quickly while lulling bowlers into a false sense of security, before releasing the real talent in the lower-middle-order? And where do the hyphens go in “lower middle order”?43rd over: England 168-6 (Buttler 60, Curran 1) Buttler reverse sweeps yet again to move into the sixties. He has played a quite brilliant innings of 60 from 60 balls. That’s it from me for today. The great Daniel Harris will be with you for the rest of the day’s play – you can email him on daniel.harris.casual@the. Bye!42nd over: England 165-6 (Buttler 58, Curran 0) The strangest thing. We all assumed Foakes underedged that sweep, because he walked off without even discussing it with Buttler, but there was no spike on Ultra-Edge and no obvious deviation. Had he reviewed, he would almost certainly have been given not out. Foakes has gone, caught at slip off Perera. He underedged a vigorous sweep which hit his pad and then the keeper’s pad before deflecting to Dhananjaya at slip. Sri Lanka needed that wicket because England were looking really comfortable.41st over: England 164-5 (Buttler 57, Foakes 19) A short ball from Pushpakumara is cracked square for four by Foakes, a shot of real authority. He has quietly moved to 19 from 27 balls. England are in a superb position here.40th over: England 158-5 (Buttler 56, Foakes 14) Perera replaces Lakmal and has the usual LBW shout against Buttler turned down by S Ravi. Sri Lanka decide not to review, which is a surprise given that it’s Buttler and they have two remaining. It was a really good shout. It pitched on off and middle, from around the wicket, and turned a mile to hit Buttler on the rump as he missed a reverse sweep. Ah, Hawkeye shows it would have bounced over the top of the stumps. Nothing to see here.39th over: England 156-5 (Buttler 55, Foakes 13) Buttler takes another delivery from Pushpakumara on the full, pinging a reverse sweep to the cover boundary. England have swept so much today Foakes joins the club with a firm sweep to the fence at square leg. He looks in excellent touch.38th over: England 147-5 (Buttler 50, Foakes 9) Buttler pulls Lakmal for a single to reach a coruscating run-a-ball fifty, an innings full of invention and authority. Foakes drives the next ball sweetly through extra cover for his first boundary.“Buttler really is a ridiculous batsman isn’t he?” says Guy Hornsby. “His reading of the game, pitch and situation is without equal in England. You feel the innings will hinge on his score with Foakes and Curran still relatively fresh to the pressure of international cricket. I haven’t seen so many sweeps since 1984.” 37th over: England 141-5 (Buttler 49, Foakes 4) There have been a lot of LBW appeals today and Buttler survives another after an attempted reverse sweep. I think it hit him outside the line and it ma have hit the glove as well. That aside, he was plumb.36th over: England 139-5 (Buttler 48, Foakes 3) Buttler is averaging 48 since his recall to Test cricket, and that includes a couple of declaration dismissals. This has been another excellent knock. Foakes has started calmly at the other end.35th over: England 134-5 (Buttler 46, Foakes 0) The new batsman is Ben Foakes, who defends the last four balls of the over.Moeen Ali survives a big shout for LBW from Pushpakumara after missing a whip across the line. Lakmal decides on a review. This is close - and it’s out! It was hitting leg stump halfway up and that meant Marais Erasmus’s on-field decision was overturned. I don’t think Moeen or Sri Lanka expected that to be given out.34th over: England 134-4 (Buttler 46, Moeen Ali 10) Moeen has started carefully, happy to play a supporting role to Buttler. He has 10 from 21 balls, Buttler 46 from 44.33rd over: England 130-4 (Buttler 43, Moeen Ali 9) Buttler smashes a slog-sweep for four off Pushpakumara, another different stroke to add the lap sweep, orthodox sweep and reverse sweep in this innings. He has 43 from 42 balls.32nd over: England 124-4 (Buttler 38, Moeen Ali 8) Suranga Lakmal, Sri Lanka’s sole seam bowler, returns to the attack and bowls a good over - one from it.31st over: England 123-4 (Buttler 38, Moeen Ali 7) Malinda Pushpakumara starts the afternoon session to Moeen, who continues the sweepathon with a couple of runs to fine leg.30th over: England 120-4 (Buttler 38, Moeen Ali 4) Dilruwan Perera comes on for the last over before lunch and is lapped for two by Buttler. I can’t remember an England batsman playing as many sweeps since Graham Gooch’s masterpiece in the 1987 World Cup semi-final. A handful of singles make it another good over for England, who have had a terrific session. Don’t be fooled by things like “the scoreboard” - England have done very well on a pitch that is already doing plenty for the spinners. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.29th over: England 115-4 (Buttler 35, Moeen Ali 2) A dipping full toss from Pushpakumara is swept ruthlessly for four by Buttler, who is playing a gem of an innings: 35 from just 30 balls. He ends the over with yet another sweep for four. All bar five of his runs, I think, have came from a variety of sweeps and laps.28th over: England 103-4 (Buttler 25, Moeen Ali 0) Terrific batting from Buttler, who nails consecuive sweeps for four off Dananjaya. That shot, in its various guises, has been England’s best friend this morning. Buttler demonstrates the point by breezily reverse sweeping his third boundary in as many balls.27th over: England 90-4 (Buttler 12, Moeen Ali 0) This looks like a carbon copy of the first day at Galle, when England lost five wickets before lunch, but I think they have played much better this morning in pretty tricky circumstances. The main frustration is Root’s absent-minded dismissal he was looking very good.26th over: England 89-4 (Buttler 11, Moeen Ali 0) The new batsman is Moeen Ali. Akila Dananjaya strikes in his first over! Burns pushed at a difficult delivery which turned a long way to take the edge, and Dhananjaya de Silva took an excellent low catch at slip. Burns will be frustrated to miss out on a first Test fifty but he played very well to make 43 from 81 balls.25th over: England 87-3 (Burns 41, Buttler 11) Both batsmen are trying to manipulate the field by sweeping and reverse sweeping Pushpakumara. It’s an interesting tactical battle at the moment, Burns and Buttler are winning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92033cd1bfd70f89cd0ea5a2eb61fc5b62d6abf2/0_0_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dd562203111051eb89bc3fd4e3e08f","title":"five wheelie good cycling and hiking routes in thuringia","story":"From mountain peaks to Unesco-listed woodlands, castles and medieval villages, the German region boasts some of Europe’s most dramatic and enchanting landscapes1 The Rennsteig – Germany’s oldest hiking trailThuringia’s most famous hiking path is steeped in tradition, and known across Europe for its superb scenery. Hundreds of historic boundary stones – the symbol of the Rennsteig – mark the route and tell their own story about how this path was for years a border between the Franconian and Thuringian provinces.The 105-mile route winds down from the town of Eisenach (home of Wartburg Castle), via Suhl, and ends at Blankenstein, right on the current border between Thuringia and Bavaria. Today, there’s also a 120-mile cycle path that runs almost parallel to the walking route, but with longer deviations to avoid too many buttock-bashing hill climbs. But while the cycle path is still a teenager, the classic hiking route is nearly 700 years old. You can sense the souls that have trodden this famous path over the years, along the historic ridgeline above the forests. Some 100,000 walkers come every year to explore this evocative slice of countryside. And deep below your feet a plethora of tunnels carry some of Germany’s most important road and rail routes – including the tubes carrying the brand new Erfurt to Nuremberg high-speed railway.2 The Hochrhoener trail Parts of the Hochrhoener trail extend into Hesse and Bavaria, but its heart lies in Thuringia. Running from Bad Kissingen to Bad Salzungen, via Kreuzberg and the Wasserkuppe mountain, the Hochrhoener trail snakes for 87 miles. It is split into nine stages, if you only want to walk a portion of the longer trail, and crests out at an impressive 876 metres. And if you still feel like you want to go higher, the Hochrhoener is the perfect place for gliding in Thuringia. If you gaze skywards from the paths you can often see gliders catching the currents, which are perfect here due to the geography of the mountains and the way the weather systems work their way through the area. Stargazers can veer off the main path on the Geba trail to discover the “Sternenpark” or Star Park – one of Europe’s leading dark sky landscapes. With platforms and viewing devices provided, it is ideal for gazing into space and spotting stars and planets. And for a taste of history, you can explore the Point Alpha trail leading to the Point Alpha military installations and the remains of the former inner German border – the iron curtain. In this area on the border there’s also Merkers mine – a former salt mine, where the Nazis stashed treasures during the second world war.3 The Thuringian Chain-of-Towns – long-distance cycle trailArchitecture aficionados will love this journey through the buildings and history of Thuringia’s main urban centres. The Chain-of-Towns trail runs for a total of 140 miles, but most of that is over flat to gently sloping ground – so the going is not like pulling teeth. And the route is also perhaps best enjoyed in small portions. Electric bikes are encouraged and regular charging stations pepper the route, plus there are a slew of DB (Deutsche Bahn) railway stations along the way, where you can let the train take the strain if you don’t want to cycle the whole thing. The Chain-of-Towns trail begins in Eisenach, home to the Unesco world heritage site, Wartburg Castle. Next, Gotha and its castle Schloss Friedenstein. Cosmopolitan Erfurt’s student population ensures plenty of bars, and its handsome, historic centre is home to such architectural highlights as the Old Synagogue – one of Europe’s oldest, which is itself home to the famous Erfurt Treasure of gold and silver. Then it’s on to historic Weimar and Jena, and then to Altenburg, where the route concludes.4 Saale cycle route – hills aplentyThose double-wheeled daredevils who look in awe at the Tour de France’s King of the Mountains exploits can find their cycling satisfaction on this challenging and ultimately rewarding run through the heart of the Thuringian hills following the River Saale. Coming in at a thigh-chafing 250 miles, the Saale cycle route calls for plenty of Vaseline in the panniers. The first part of the route from picturesque Fichtelgebirge through the high hills is the most spectacular, and tea breaks can be taken while you marvel at gorges or pristine lakes. As the river widens and flattens, castles and vineyards become more common sights. Bad Sulza’s wineries are especially noted for their bottles of Grüner Veltliner or Muscat Ottonel. Reaching Saalfeld, cyclists or walkers find the mesmerising Fairy Grottoes, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s most colourful caves. Then, finally, you find peaceful meadows before the river joins the Elbe and flows on its long journey up to Hamburg and the North Sea. Jena is one of Thuringia’s main towns and provides plenty of sleeping, eating and shopping options. Optical innovator Zeiss was founded here and the town’s Zeiss Planetarium is rightly known for its audio and video shows.5 Schwarza Valley Panorama trail – for tree loversFans of forests can revel in this peaceful adventure through the trees that sprout on the eastern side of the Thuringian forest nature park. The park is packed with dense thickets of coniferous trees that provide a habitat for a huge variety of bird and animal species, and you can even forage for wild mushrooms and garlic. This 84-mile trail follows a loop route, starting and finishing in pretty Rudolstadt. Along the way, the trail passes various picture-postcard villages and towns such as Bad Blankenburg, Meuselbach, Altenfeld and Cordobang. The path sometimes rises out from the forest and up into the foothills of the Thuringian Schiefergebirge mountains – whose height and scenic value give the Saxon Switzerland hills, or even the Bavarian mountains, a run for their money. Aside from the obvious arboreal attractions, the Schwarza Valley Panorama trail also passes near to several castles perched on the banks of the River Saale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals. Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd65faa3b93e5c08509382c208d06bddb43ec1a/0_1_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe53e88f6e4e7958eddd3c5d549856e","title":"from chocolate to beef roulade the culinary delights of thuringia","story":"The German region may be known for its castles, jaw-dropping landscapes and the famous faces who lived there, but its culinary scene is also something to check out when you visitGerman food is just sausages, isn’t it, and sauerkraut? Well, yes, they do have 1,200 types of wurst – but this is a country with a huge ersity of cuisine, both traditional and contemporary. With more than 200 types of bread, a nationwide passion for vegetables, and an infinite range of regional styles, served everywhere from rural inns to the country’s 300-plus Michelin-starred restaurants, Germany is arguably home to some of the most underrated cuisine in Europe. And the culinary scene in Thuringia is well worth shouting about.So if the state’s erse history, from Martin Luther and Goethe to the Weimar Republic, and spectacularly bucolic landscape, aren’t enough to keep you occupied, Thuringia’s terrific cuisine will certainly ert the attention. A mustard museum in Erfurt and the annual Onion Festival in Weimar (with live music and food stalls, it attracts more than 350,000 people yearly) are proof of how seriously they take their food.The Thuringian bratwurst is the culinary kingpin of the region, but you can tuck in to other hearty dishes such as the succulent Mutzbraten (grilled pork) and Thuringian dumplings, or for those with a sweeter tooth, how about some handmade chocolate? And why not wash it all down with a dark beer, for which the region is well known, or a glass of white wine from Bad Sulza in north-eastern Thuringia? Just a few more reasons why Thuringia should be firmly on the tourist map.Thuringian bratwurstLocals claim the Thuringer rostbratwurst – its full name – is the best bratwurst in Germany. The original recipe dates back to 1434, so they certainly know what they are doing. Consisting of minced pork (local variations have beef or game) mixed with marjoram and garlic, some also feature caraway seed, although its inclusion is a subject of hot debate among Thuringians. It’s traditionally grilled over an open fire and eaten on the street with a bun and mustard (ketchup is a definite faux pas), but having it with sauerkraut and potatoes is also common. Locals consume nearly three times as many bratwursts a year than the average German.Try one from a street stall, or Faust Food, an indoor food market. Still pining for sausages? Then head to the Eichsfeld region in western Thuringia for three types of air-dried sausage: runde, feldkieker (which looks a bit like a club), or the spicy stracke, and you can sample them at the Klausenhof tavern in Bornhagen.Thuringer klösseThe dumpling is a staple dish of the region and traditionally served with a Sunday roast with lots of gravy. Filling and wholesome, the local dumpling doesn’t contain flour and is made of raw grated potatoes and cooked mashed potatoes, seasoned, rolled into fist-sized balls with two or three croutons stuffed inside and then simmered in water. They go well with meat or veg, and were originally popular with the less well-off as they were cheap to make. Try them at Die Landgrafenstube Wartburg Hotel in Eisenach or, for a cheaper alternative, head to Zum Guldenen Rade in Erfurt.MutzbratenA tasty chunk of seasoned pork, which is flame grilled – traditionally over a birchwood fire. It’s served with bread, sauerkraut and mustard. Try one in Schmölln or Altenburg, in the eastern part of the state, where it is something of a speciality, or in an inn or restaurant while walking in the Thuringian Forest.Goldhelm chocolate Inspired chocolate creations are what you will find at Goldhelm Schokolade, which has two outlets in Erfurt. There’s a tiny shop on Krämerbrücke (Merchants’ Bridge), the longest inhabited bridge in Europe – it dates from the 14th century – or there’s a larger version with a lovely cafe on nearby Kreuzgasse. Using high-grade cocoa from Peru and Vietnam allows the makers to lower the sugar content. Their signature chocolate is the Bridge Truffle. They do a memorable hot chocolate too.Beers, wines and spiritsThuringia has a long tradition of brewing beer and producing wine: in the middle ages there were nearly 600 breweries in Erfurt, Germany’s oldest beer purity law was laid down in Weissensee in 1434. The region is known for its dark beers, one of the best is Köstrizter from the little town of Köstritz. Most towns have their own breweries, such as those in Weimar, Eisenach and Erfurt (head here to the Goldener Schwan, which has a wide variety of beers, including wheat and pilsner). Hikers in the Thuringian Forest should visit the Ankerla Brewery in Steinach.Oenophiles will find some fabulous white wines, too – and some very good reds – around Bad Sulza in the north-east one of the best vineyards is Weingut Zahn in Grossheringen, which has a restaurant and tours.And don’t forget to try Thuringia’s range of digestifs, or kräuterschnaps. You will find them in most bars and restaurants – look out for Aromatique, made in Neudietendorf, using spices and herbs Rhöntropfen, produced since the 1870s in the Rhön region and also made with herbs and spices, and Nordhäuser Doppelkorn, a grain brandy from Nordhausen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9425f5b81f3dc73a33d4d83278462aaa4181fd7c/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbed519ba607a04b1c62249fb1af8ea","title":"fairytale castles and secret forests discover germanys best kept secret","story":"Deep in the heart of Germany lies Thuringia – a state bursting with both cultural curiosities and unrivalled natural beautyExplore the wildernessThe 700-year-old Rennsteig trail traces a spectacular ridgeway through the Thuringian forest, and is a mecca for hikers and cyclists. Originally a trade route in the Middle Ages, the path is popular with both walkers wishing to get away for a while and cyclists up for a serious challenge. With 105 miles running from Bach’s birthplace, Eisenach, to the river Saale in Blankenstein, there is plenty to take in.Medieval wondersStrewn across Thuringia’s lush scenery are an incredible 400 castles and palaces. Queen Victoria, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha famously danced at Schloss Friedenstein, while Richard Wagner’s operatic masterpiece Tannhäuser was inspired by Wartburg Castle, now a Unesco world heritage site and home to a 9,000-strong treasure trove of European art. Erfurt, the state capital, is also worth a visit. Peek inside St Mary’s Cathedral, where the 16th century monk Martin Luther was ordained, before taking in Erfurt’s perfectly preserved medieval old town that’s most impressive.Art and cultureEver since a youthful Johann Wolfgang von Goethe arrived in the city of Weimar, flushed with success from his romantic bestseller The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thuringia has been a haven for artists, philosophers, musicians, innovators and reformers. Weimar’s numerous coffee houses were frequented by everyone from Johann Sebastian Bach to Friedrich Nietzsche, Wassily Kandinsky and Marlene Dietrich. The world-class design school Bauhaus opened in Weimar in 1919 – before moving to Dessau in 1925 – and next year’s centenary will be marked with a plethora of parties and special events, culminating in the grand opening of the new bauhaus museum weimar.Take a different viewPrize for the coolest place to see goes to the Carl Zeiss-Planetarium in Jena. The world’s oldest planetarium, built in 1926, features an impressive dome projection system where Pink Floyd and Queen provide the soundtrack to gas clouds and galaxies. And for holiday snaps unlike anyone else’s Instagram feed, visit Erfurt-Rieth: a concrete jungle of 1970s GDR architecture, complete with retro-futurist skywalks, plattenbau tower blocks, murals and sculptures.The best of the wurstIt would be remiss not to mention Thuringia’s legendary sausages – rostbratwursts, or “rosters” – which are one of the world’s most delicious things to put on a BBQ, slather in mustard and slap into a sliced roll. The marjoram and spices in these protected-designation-of-origin sausages bring them to life.

There was, however, a behind-the-scenes follow-up to the incident that shows the Soviet leader in another light.Khrushchev bore no grudge against the Irish diplomat who had chaired the session, one of the most contentious in the annals of diplomacy, and in an apparent gesture of conciliation sent him a bottle of Russian wine.Frederick Boland, Ireland’s first ambassador to the UK and the UN, disclosed the gesture in a note to his chiefs in Dublin, which is due to be published this week in a release of official archives.After leaving the UN gathering in New York, the Soviet leader dispatched a Russian diplomat called Zorin to the Irish diplomatic mission to “express his regret” for not being able to call and say goodbye, Boland said in his note, according to the .Zorin said Khrushchev was “well satisfied” with Boland’s objectivity as chair of the plenary session and hoped he would continue. “That evening a case of Russian wine was delivered at 1 East End Avenue with his compliments!”Boland had broken his gavel during the session in a vain effort to impose order after the leader of the Philippine delegation, Lorenzo Sumulong, earned Khrushchev’s ire by denouncing Soviet oppression in eastern Europe.Accounts differ over whether Khrushchev banged his desk or the rostrum with his shoe, or merely brandished the shoe, while calling Sumulong a lackey of American imperialism. The outburst mortified some colleagues.His granddaughter Nina said he had removed his shoes earlier because they were new and tight. He was banging his fist on the table when his watch fell off and the “good performer” spotted an opportunity. “He bent down to pick up the watch and saw his empty shoes. How lucky!”Boland’s anecdote suggests the Soviet leader, shoeless or not, did not want to step on his hosts.In his note the diplomat called the Soviet leader an enigma. “He is the personification of elemental violence. Moreover, like Hitler, he is power-drunk and a doctrinaire. These dangerous qualities are tempered in his case, however, by an extraordinarily sharp intelligence, a keen sense of humour and, I would say, a good deal of plain humanity.

Some left our block at midnight using secret paths for other camps, especially Kutupalong, where there is not so much fear about repatriation.”Jani, 30, a Rohingya living in camp 14, said the security presence had doubled in the past two days in several settlements, elevating the panic among the Rohingya. “When the sun sets the security teams come to every entry point in the camps and they don’t leave till the morning,” he said. “People are running away and spending days and nights in the forest or other camps.”There have also been reports of Bangladesh camp officials, known as CICs, assaulting Rohingya who have refused to cooperate. In a video, verified by the , Ata Ullah, a Rohingya leader in Chakmarkul Camp 21 alleges that he was beaten in the office of a CIC officer “with a large stick” on Monday after he was unable to provide them with list of Rohingya in his camp. “They stepped on my neck, I could not stand it,” Ullah said in the footage. “You can see from my face how I was beaten.”It is the latest signal that the repatriations, due to begin on Thursday, may not be voluntary, despite multiple assurances by the Bangladesh foreign secretary and the refugee commissioner that they would not force any Rohingya to go back against their will.Dozens of Rohingya families interviewed by the , who were placed on a list of 2,200 refugees “approved” for return by Myanmar without their consent, said they did not want to return under the current conditions. Many had fled the camps and gone into hiding, while for others the prospect of going back was so alarming they had attempted suicide.Nurul Islam, a Rohingya community leader in Unchiprang refugee camp, Cox’s Bazar, said that up to 50 families in the vicinity hadgone into hiding.“Last week the officials told several families sternly that they would no more be allowed to stay in Bangladesh and have to return to Myanmar and almost all of them have disappeared from their shacks in our camp in the past three or four days,” Islam told the . “Like all other Rohingya they are too scared to return to Burma. So, they have gone into hiding.”Forced repatriation also risks splitting up families. Osiullah, who like many other Rohingya uses one name, said he had gone into hiding after discovering that three of his children, the youngest aged five, were on the list for return while he, his wife and three other children were not.“I got terribly scared to find the names of only three of children listed,” he said. “I’ve heard they will force us cross the border. We slipped out of the camp because I could not take the risk.”The UN has repeatedly called for a halt to the repatriation plans. UNHCR said it would not be facilitating or providing assistance for return, other than interviewing Rohingya on the list and assessing their willingness to go back. On Tuesday Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, condemned the “terror and panic” it was causing Rohingya who were at “imminent risk of being returned to Myanmar against their will.”There has been no statement on the issue from Myanmar’s state counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been at the Asean summit in Singapore this week. At a meeting with US vice president Mike Pence on Wednesday afternoon, Aung San Suu Kyi was pressed about how those responsible for the Rohingya crisis and “created such suffering” were being held accountable, to which she responded simply: “we understand our country better than anyone”. However, it was Aung San Suu Kyi, not Pence, who requested the meeting.The most vocal condemnation of the Rohingya crisis came from Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said: “It would seem that Aung San Suu Kyi is trying to defend what is indefensible.”Speaking on the sidelines before his summit address, he added: “They are actually oppressing these people to the point of killing them, mass killing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b607cd020f2f67f943ce025b530fd8e7b4ab35be/257_546_2987_1792/master/2987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaed54e54af5e5e0f178b22fd67065d9","title":"boy gets six points on future driving licence for scooter speeding","story":"Boy, 15, caught by police who clocked him at ‘high speed’ on electric scooter in north-east EnglandIt is perhaps not unusual for overexcited new drivers to clock up a few points on their licence in their first year or two behind the wheel.But pity the 15-year-old boy who, having never put pedal to the metal on a public highway, already has six points on his licence. The teenager appeared in court last month after he was caught by police in Cleveland, north-east England, for clocking a “high speed” on an electric scooter.With top speeds of up to 40mph, the scooters may only be ridden on authorised or private land, and are strictly prohibited on pavements. Police did not reveal any more details of the offence, but warned parents of the consequences of buying scooters for their children.Electric scooters and skateboards are becoming more common on city streets across the UK. But few riders realise they risk arrest and a possible fine of up to £75 for riding what are classed as personal light electric vehicles (PLEVs).The law – based on an 1835 Highways Act, according to scooter maker Micro – lags behind those in elsewhere in Europe. In France electric scooters can be ridden on cycle lanes and the pavement, provided riders keep to a speed limit in Germany pavement riding is legal up to 6kmh (nearly 4mph) and in Austria and Switzerland riders can bomb down cycle lanes and on roads at up to 25kmh.In California, PLEVs are road-legal as long as riders are over 16 and wear helmets.Commenting on the Cleveland case, PC Mike Doherty, of the Coulby Newham neighbourhood policing team, said: “These scooters are not toys, and not only can they be extremely dangerous but they are also not legal to ride on pavements and roads, and I think many parents aren’t aware of this.“Under the Road Traffic Act we can report the inidual rider for not having insurance, a licence, a number plate, helmet and MOT for the scooter.“This person will then be reported for summons and will be given a minimum of six points on their licence or future licence and a possible fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ed1e59b9e9db4c84df78d4810100406be6625e5/0_435_1702_1021/master/1702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b826e9728d3b8423d0e9eda9d830795","title":"kremlin critic alexei navalny flies out of russia after ban lifted","story":"Opposition figure allowed to leave to attend European court of human rights caseKremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been allowed to fly out of Russia to attend the finale of a case he filed at Europe’s top human rights court, a day after border guards stopped him leaving the country.Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition figure, wants to be in Strasbourg on Thursday when the European court of human rights is due to rule on whether his numerous detentions by police in Russia have been politically motivated or not.He was prevented from flying out of Moscow on Tuesday over an unpaid court fine, which he said had been suddenly and illegally enforced as a pretext to stop him travelling abroad.The Federal Bailiffs Service, which blocked his exit, did not respond to a request for comment regarding Navalny’s allegations that its actions were illegal.However, it told the Tass news agency on Tuesday evening that it had rescinded the travel ban after Navalny had paid the fine.The 42-year-old lawyer posted a photograph on social media of himself passing through passport control at a Moscow airport on Wednesday and said he had encountered no problems leaving the country this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b776cacd30dc9e8f2634570bfb1ca9911a00cab/0_250_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c2a13253e097db82bb8a8e2d05cc316","title":"scientists divided over new research method to combat malaria","story":"Work on engineered gene used to modify DNA of mosquitoes ‘could be stifled’ by perceived risk to environmentResearch on a radical new way to combat malaria and other devastating diseases could be knocked off track if a UN bioersity conference imposes a moratorium on the work, a group of scientists have said.Some scientists believe the different approach has the potential to transform the battle against malaria. It involves engineered gene drives which are used to modify the DNA of wild organisms on a mass scale. In the case of mosquitoes the method would have the potential to wipe out populations of certain species which carry the malaria parasite, say the scientists.Critics have argued that gene drives pose an unacceptable risk by spreading modified genes through the environment with unpredictable consequences.The UN’s convention on biological ersity (CBD) meeting in Egypt next week will consider recommendations that call on governments to refrain from releasing organisms that contain gene drives, even in small-scale field trials.The wording has prompted more than 100 scientists to sign an open letter opposing the proposal. If adopted, they believe, the move would stifle gene drive work across the board, because field trials were crucial for understanding whether the technology worked in the wild.“We should not decide against the use of a tool before potential costs and benefits can be fully evaluated,” the letter stated.Gene drives come in many different forms but all are designed to ramp up the presence of engineered genes in a target population of organisms. One method creates modified mosquitoes in the laboratory which, when released, breed with wild mosquitoes and pass on a mutated gene that renders the females sterile. As a result the population crashes.Austin Burt, a researcher at Imperial College London, who works on gene drives to tackle malaria, said a moratorium such as the one suggested would “stifle research and be a huge distraction”.He said: “It’s such a new field that there isn’t even agreement on what a gene drive is. To say all of them, in all organisms and in all environments, are unsafe is meaningless. We already have mechanisms for assessing them. To judge safety you have to do things on a case-by-case basis, you have to know the exact organism, the exact construct, and the exact environment.”There are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes, but only the females of about 40 species belonging to the genus Anopheles transmit malaria well enough to cause significant illness and death in humans. The disease kills more than 400,000 people a year, mostly children in Africa, and infects more than 200 million.Fredros Okumu, a director of science at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania, said that while gene drives carried potential risks they should not be ruled out.He said: “For the first time we have a tool that requires minimal human compliance, a minimal health system, and which would work even in difficult to reach areas because mosquitoes will spread it by themselves.“We are not saying this is ready for deployment. But the truth is we really need something that gives us the oomph to remove this disease, especially in places in Africa that struggle with health systems. Even if there is some risk we should allow scientists to investigate them rather than say don’t go there.”Jim Thomas, at the ETC Group, an NGO that opposes gene drives, claimed that more than 200 organisations, networks and iniduals from the global food movement supported a ban on releasing the drives into the environment. He argued that the letter, organised by a PR agency, appeared to serve scientists with a professional interest.Thomas also raised concerns about how gene drives would be used in agriculture. In principle, a gene drive could make entire fields of crops drought resistant, or wipe out all weeds. In a recent report the group claimed the approach could undermine sustainable and equitable food and agriculture.Joyce Tait, co-director of the Innogen Institute, at the University of Edinburgh, who has not signed the letter, said: “It is widely seen as bad practice to attempt to ensure the safety of innovative developments by focusing on the technique used to produce them – in this case a gene drive – than on the properties of the end product itself.“Some applications of gene drives will be benign, others will be potentially hazardous, and treating them all equally undermines the principle of evidence-based decision making.”Robin Lovell-Badge, chair of the Royal Society’s genetic technologies programme, said: While much can be learned about specific gene drives in strictly controlled laboratory settings, it will be critically important to continue the research by carrying out field trials … without the ability to carry out field trials the best scientists are less likely to get involved in any of the research, funders would lose interest, and we could miss out on important ways to reduce the burden of disease and to restore compromised environments to a more original state.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1624490dd7913fd48984118b06e6749763a37988/0_176_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5826ffbbf225305f031196ba5faf52b6","title":"wednesday briefing the backstops here may tells cabinet","story":"PM presses ministers to endorse her Brexit deal … CIA sought ‘truth serum’ for 911 interrogations … and Zoe Williams finds the answer to life’s chaosHello, it’s Warren Murray in from a recce with some fresh intel.Theresa May is due to hold an emergency meeting this afternoon where she will call on cabinet to endorse her final Brexit deal. The PM is understood to have agreed with Brussels on an independent arbitration process to decide when and how the UK-wide customs “backstop” would be activated, extended or terminated. This morning, Tony Blair is hitting out at Jeremy Corbyn for his “abject refusal” to lead the UK “out of the Brexit nightmare”. We are live-blogging the lead-up to May’s big pitch.Yesterday, ministers were given a preview of key documents at No 10 but not allowed to take any away. Hard-Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, who are not ministers, were quick to condemn the prospective deal. If it clears cabinet, the agreement would likely be taken to parliament in mid-December, after an EU summit at the end of November. Jeremy Corbyn, Vince Cable and the Westminster leaders of Plaid Cymru and the SNP have signed a letter to May insisting on a “truly meaningful debate” in parliament. Corbyn said separately: “If this deal doesn’t meet our six tests and work for the whole country, then we will vote against it.” The Democratic Unionists – upon whose votes Theresa May relies to hold government – said they would not accept Northern Ireland being delineated from the rest of UK.Today’s cabinet meeting where May will make her pitch is expected to last for three hours. There is the potential for some key ministerial resignations that could derail May’s plan. But if ministers give their backing No 10 will launch an all-out campaign to sell it to the public.Midweek catch-up – Soupçons of news to keep you going …\u0026gt Wildfires in California have killed at least 50 people, with the Camp fire officially the deadliest in the state’s history.

Files released to the American Civil Liberties Union also give a chilling picture of how tortures and mistreatment were legitimised by the involvement of CIA medical officers. Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 911 attacks was waterboarded 140 times and the CIA doctor argued the torture “provided periodic relief from his standing sleep deprivation”. “Without the doctors’ participation none of this would have happened,” said Dror Ladin, an attorney on the ACLU’s national security project. “They were essential participants and completely complicit.” According to the papers, the CIA abandoned the idea of a truth serum for fear of getting into a legal wrangle with George W Bush’s administration.The world is waking up to the environmental danger of single-use plastics.

A further 1,000 property owners are expected to be informed from January and February. A public consultation process will open from Wednesday afternoon, and run into early 2019 in relation to upgrading the bus and cycle lanes. The BusConnects project involves upgrading 16 core bus routes and cycle lanes into the city.

Photograph:  Paul FaithAFPThe European Union and United Kingdom have agreed the draft of a withdrawal agreement covering the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU. The biggest difficulty here was agreeing a way to avoid the return of a hard Irish border. The main focus when the agreement is published will be on exactly how this is achieved. This is the much-discussed border backstop.It’s really just a badly-named guarantee. It is a promise that no matter what happens in the future agreement on a trading relationship between the UK and the EU, to be negotiated during the transition phase, that there would be no hard border in Ireland.The backstop was first agreed in principle last December, when the EU and the UK signed up to a “political declaration” that would form the basis for the withdrawal agreement. This also covered the UK’s financial settlement, the mutual rights of citizens and the two-year transition period which means nothing will actually change for 21 months after next March’s exit.As well as promising to maintain the open Irish border, British prime minister Theresa May also promised that the arrangement would not result in any differences between the North and the rest of the UK. The difficulty in the negotiations has centred on how the promise is to be made good, and how long any backstop commitment will last for.It proposes that the whole of the UK remains in a customs union with the EU, while a new trade deal between the two sides is agreed. This is the so-called UK-wide backstop. That is an attempt to maintain Ms May’s twin obligations – of the open border in Ireland, and no different customs regime between the North and the rest of the UK. However, there will be some differences in other non-customs rules and regulations between the North and Britain, a potential political problem.Also, the problem for Brexiteers is that this keeps the UK under EU rules for a period – and perhaps indefinitely if no new trade deal can be agreed.The UK will be signing up to an arrangement to maintain an open border, whatever the outcome of future talks – but the key will be how this would happen and under what circumstances it could end. The British wanted to be able to exit the backstop agreement once they were happy a new trade deal with the EU would avoid a hard border. But the Irish and EU side pointed out that this isn’t really a backstop if the UK could get out of it whenever it wanted.And that’s why they have said that if the UK-wide backstop is temporary, there may need to be – wait for it – “a backstop to the backstop”. This would involve a specific guarantee that the North would remain effectively in the EU trading bloc in future, if everything else failed.I know. The Irish Government has said it is agnostic – it doesn’t mind whether there is a Northern Ireland only backstop, or a UK-wide backstop, once the guarantee is watertight.Reports suggest that the final text includes just one backstop – based on a UK-wide arrangement – but that there will be additional Northern Ireland-specific elements to it, offering guarantees to Dublin. The text will be closely examined to see how this is all put together.You must be joking. The DUP will object to anything meaning different regulations could apply in the North to the rest of the UK – and this is still likely in some areas. The British Brexiteers are already out against it, warning it could leave the UK under EU rules, but without any say in how they are made.It is over to London and the UK cabinet. If they give it the thumbs up, then the EU will schedule a special summit probably for later this month, or at the latest for early next month. Once that’s agreed, the British and European Parliaments must ratify the treaty before the UK leaves at the end of March.

Although the ERG is chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, its chief organiser is Steve Baker, a former aerospace software engineer who entered parliament in 2010.Baker, who resigned as Brexit minister along with David Davis and Boris Johnson in protest against Theresa May’s Chequers plan last July, does not like what he hears about the deal being considered by the cabinet on Wednesday.“What the prime minister is likely to ask us to support is not merely just imperfect. It is to put us into a position that is worse than EU membership we’d have less of a voice, and it would be more difficult to escape from the same elements of the EU that control us and our economy now. It’s not just a grubby compromise we can put up with,” he told The  on Tuesday.\u0026nbspBaker’s success in organising the unruly group of Conservative Eurosceptics began before the Brexit referendum with Conservatives for Britain, and he helped to marshall MPs in support of the Leave campaign. He predicts that if May’s Brexit deal is put to a vote in the House of Commons dozens of Conservative MPs will vote against it.“I don’t lie about the numbers. We’ve got 51 publicly on the record. We have at least another dozen who would come out against the deal.” The deal also faces opposition from a small group of pro-European Conservatives, including Jo Johnson and Dominic Grieve, and the DUP could also join opposition MPs to vote against it. For Brexiteers like Baker a defeat for the prime minister’s deal carries the risk that MPs could refuse to leave the EU without a deal and seek to delay Brexit or put it to a second referendum.“I think we need to leave the EU. People voted for it, and however imperfect the campaigns were on both sides, people voted for it.“I think everybody knows that if MPs could vote without having to face any consequences parliament would vote to remain in the EU. So is there a risk? Of course.”Baker believes that if the cabinet approves May’s Brexit deal Britain will face a profound political crisis in the coming weeks. However, he is confident that most Conservative Brexiteers will not be persuaded to back the government with threats or cajoling from the whips.“A number will. But the question is, will all of them? And the answer is no. You end up with political crisis. I don’t like it. I don’t want to be in this position. But the idea that Bill Cash after 30 odd years of campaigning on this issue at the last minute will capitulate because of a momentary political crisis is for the birds. There are newer intake MPs who are not going to accept an unacceptable deal either.” Unlike some Conservative Brexiteers, Baker accepts the legitimacy of Ireland’s demand for a guarantee that there will be no hard border after Brexit. However, he rejects the backstop in favour of a standalone treaty guaranteeing frictionless trade across the Border, an option unacceptable to Ireland and the rest of the EU.Although Baker is passionate about Brexit, he describes himself as a liberal internationalist who was “very pro-EU” before the debate over the Lisbon Treaty and Ireland’s decision to hold a second referendum on it.“The Irish were asked twice, and by the time the Irish had been asked twice I was going through the roof. And what I saw was democracy dying. So I’m not a Eurosceptic because I don’t like Europe. I became a Eurosceptic because I saw democracy dying.“I feel so passionately about this. What matters more in politics than that democracy has meaning? What is the point of electing members of parliament if in the end on important matters that people care about they can’t decide what policy is? So in the end for me it is just fundamentally about democracy.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Conservative Brexiteers said they would vote against the draft Brexit deal. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May will chair an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday after negotiators agreed the draft text of a withdrawal agreement including a backstop to ensure there can be no hard border after Brexit.If ministers approve the deal, it will go to European Union leaders at a special summit in Brussels on November 25th before being put to votes at Westminster and the European Parliament. Neither side released details of the agreement, which is reported to run to 500 pages, ahead of the cabinet meeting.As soon as the breakthrough was announced, however, Conservative Brexiteers said they would vote against the deal, which former UK foreign minister Boris Johnson described as utterly unacceptable.“It’s vassal state stuff as for the first time in 1,000 years this parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country. It is utterly unacceptable to anybody who believes in democracy,” he said.“For the first time since partition, Dublin would have more say in some aspects of the governing of Northern Ireland than London. So I don’t see how you can support from a democratic point of view.”The  understands that the deal includes a UK-wide customs backstop with provisions for extra alignment with EU rules in Northern Ireland. The breakthrough came with an agreement on a review mechanism that would determine when the backstop is no longer necessary to ensure that the Border remains open after Brexit.Dublin remained adamant that its position on a backstop remains unchanged, and would not change – that a backstop which guaranteed no hard border must remain until superseded by a trade deal which achieved the same outcome.\u0026nbspHowever, having earlier said that it had received no official information that a deal had been reached, the Government remained silent last night, with one source suggesting Dublin did not want to make Mrs May’s task any more difficult by claiming it had achieved its goals.On Tuesday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, along with Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee, met senior officials to discuss the text agreed by the negotiators.\u0026nbspHowever, Ministers were placed on standby for a Cabinet meeting today to approve the final text.\u0026nbspIn a statement on Tuesday night, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party wants “a sensible deal” which works for the North, the UK and the Republic but would oppose an agreement which it believed undermined the union between Britain and Northern Ireland.“An agreement which places new trade barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain will fundamentally undermine the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. That is not acceptable,” she said.“Over time, such a deal will weaken the Union. No unionist Prime Minister could argue that such a deal is in the national interest...It would be democratically unacceptable for Northern Ireland trade rules to be set by Brussels. Northern Ireland would have no representation in Brussels and would be dependent on a Dublin government speaking up for our core industries.”Downing Street will brief business leaders about the agreement on Wednesday in the hope of enlisting their support to lobby for the deal if cabinet approves it. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested on Tuesday night that his party would not help the prime minister to get it through the House of Commons.“We will look at the details of what has been agreed when they are available. But from what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country. Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy – and that guarantees standards and protections. If this deal doesn’t meet our six tests and work for the whole country, then we will vote against it,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Her mother was extremely anxious, unable to feed or hold her child.As there was no window into the unit, she couldn’t even see her. Nobody was allowed into the ICU and Manu had to be cared for by one nurse, so the infection didn’t spread to other infants on the ward.Manu was suffering from sepsis, a serious and potentially deadly condition where an infection gets into the bloodstream and the body overreacts.If left untreated, babies can go into septic shock and their organs can begin to shut down within hours. Manu had already been given powerful “last resort” antibiotics for more than a week.  Perplexingly, they didn’t seem to be working.Laboratory tests came back revealing why. The infection that had spread to Manu’s blood was resistant to every antibiotic the hospital stocked, except for one: Polymyxin B. This explained why her infection hadn’t responded. Manu was given Polymyxin B immediately, but had to be monitored carefully as it can damage the kidneys and nerves.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsBabies less than a month old are vulnerable to catching infections as their immune systems have not fully developed, and if those infections get into the blood they can cause sepsis. Globally, sepsis is one of the three leading causes of infant deaths. In India, sepsis was responsible for at least 640,000 babies dying before they reached a month old in 2016, Unicef figures show.Over the past decade hospitals have been faced with an extra threat. As was the case for Manu’s infection, they are seeing “alarming” rates of antibiotic resistance in the types of bacteria that typically cause sepsis, making care of sick babies much more difficult.In most big city hospitals, where babies with sepsis are referred, common antibiotics are no longer effective. More than 80 per cent of some types of bacteria causing sepsis in babies are multidrug resistant – immune to nearly all antibiotics.Doctors are having to administer “last-line” antibiotics, normally given only in emergencies, as the first drug. It was estimated in a study in 2016 that resistant infections kill more than 58,000 babies in India every year, though the author of the research said this was a vast underestimate.The laboratory at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where around half of bacteria are resistant to the carbapenem antibiotics used in emergencies to treat resistant infections “We are in a fix. We are staring at a gloomy situation,” said Dr Suman Chaurasia, a paediatrician and sepsis researcher at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, a top government hospital in Delhi.While older antibiotics are being repurposed for adults with sepsis, there is a lack of data on babies and so there are few alternatives. If resistance to “last line” drugs continues to rise, Dr Chaurasia is worried these “rescue” antibiotics currently used to save babies’ lives will also fail.“Our biggest concern is what kind of drug would be left for us? If drugs like colistin are getting out of our reach, being snatched out of our hands, how are we going to treat babies further?”“I can’t think of anything more threatening to mothers and babies lives than antibiotic resistance,” said Professor Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics \u0026amp Policy (CDDEP), a US public health organisation.“Antibiotics have made us lazy. It’s held out the hope that antibiotics will cure infection but they are working less and less often.”He called for government policies to regulate sales and use of antibiotics and for better infection control in hospitals. “We are just not doing enough on infection control… we need hand washing, hand barriers against bacteria spreading. These are non-negotiable but they are flouted routinely in all facilities.”India has become the global epicentre of antibiotic resistance, with many factors combining to hasten the spread of superbugs. Bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics naturally over time, but the mass consumption of the drugs speeds it up dramatically, particularly if they are used inappropriately.India’s use of antibiotics in human medicine more than doubled between 2010 and 2015 as incomes rose. The country has a huge population, millions of whom are living in poor, unsanitary conditions, and there are frequent outbreaks of infectious disease which require antibiotics to treat.Drugs are available over the counter and many people take the wrong antibiotics or an incomplete course and a majority of people get medical care from unregulated private doctors who are often untrained and may prescribe inappropriately. This is combined with poor sanitation and infection control in many hospitals, allowing resistant organisms to spread.Antibiotics have also been widely used in Indian farming to treat and prevent disease in cattle, chicken and pigs used for meat, milk and dairy. Tiny frequent doses are also used to fatten animals up for slaughter, a practice banned in the EU and US because this kind of use fuels resistance.Finally the country is a global hub of antibiotic production, and the pharmaceutical factories leak antibiotic-ridden effluent into the environment during the manufacturing process, as revealed in a previous Bureau investigation.This “perfect storm” has led to soaring rates of resistance among bacteria in India, creating powerful superbugs which then spread all over the world. At three hospitals the Bureau visited in Delhi and Jaipur, there was a reported resistance rate to a group of last line antibiotics known as carbapenems of between 50 and 70 per cent. In the UK, fewer than 2 per cent of bloodstream infections are resistant to these drugs.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldIt is having a huge impact on newborns vulnerable to infection, experts warn. Dr Chaurasia and his team produced a landmark study, tracking babies with sepsis from three government hospitals in Delhi. Before this, the lack of data meant sepsis was has not been taken seriously as a public health concern, he said.His team followed 13,530 babies between July 2011 and February 2014 and found nearly 15 per cent suffered sepsis. They found the condition was responsible for nearly a quarter of all baby deaths. Inthe UK it is responsible for less than 2 per cent.The levels of multidrug resistance was “alarming”, Dr Chaurasia said. One of the bacteria causing the sepsis, acinetobacter, had a resistance rate of 82 per cent. Two thirds of the babies infected with it died.The study also found that most cases happened within the first three days of life, some within just 12 hours. It is very unusual for infections to be caught so soon and the doctors are not sure where they are coming from.Dr Suman Chaurasia, a paediatrician and sepsis researcher at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, who carried out the study. He said rates of antibiotic resistance were \u0026#39alarmingIt could be that mothers were carrying bacteria and passed it to their baby in the womb, or in the birth canal during labour. Or it may be that unsanitary equipment or practises during pregnancy or birth introduced the bacteria to the mother and baby, such as unsterile forceps being used or staff failing to change their gloves or wash their hands between patients. The babies may also be catching the bacteria from the hospital surroundings or from doctors, nurses or families who visit.After carrying out the groundbreaking study, Dr Chaurasia and his team hope to come up with solutions: alternatives to antibiotics that could be used on newborns, old antibiotics that could be repurposed, and if so, the dose that could be used. Currently there is no quick was of diagnosing sepsis – sending a blood culture to a lab takes at least three days and a bacteria can’t always be grown. It is hoped a fast bedside test can be developed instead.Some believe India should concentrate on improving the cleanliness of its hospitals. “Unless India improves sanitation in communities and infection control in hospitals we won’t be able to tackle antibiotic resistance at all,” said Dr Abdul Ghafur, a professor in infectious diseases and co-ordinator of the 2012 Chennai Declaration, a roadmap for combating antibiotic resistance in India.Many are already working to improve infection control. The international NGO Jhpiego is working to lower rates of maternal and baby mortality by encouraging good menstrual hygiene, good birthing practices and appropriate antibiotic prescription in Indian hospitals, communities and families.It can be difficult to instil these behaviour changes, said Dr Kailash Saran, head of Jhpiego Rajasthan. “We faced a lot of resistance from staff,” he said. “They assume the hygiene is poor so they give antibiotics.Yet slowly, with mentorship and repetition, behaviours are beginning to change. “If you start explaining why you are doing certain things, people are more likely to follow,” said Dr Bulbul Sood, country director of Jhpiego India.Two days after being given Polymyxin B, baby Manu seemed to respond. She was well enough to come off oxygen and be moved to a different ICU where her mother could visit and feed her breast milk using a tube.

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect. Todd Haynes followed his glam rock pseudo-biopic Velvet Goldmine (1998) with this inventive exploration of the many sides of Bob Dylan. Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect. Back when the first tour was announced,\u0026nbspFleetwood said in a statement: “Fleetwood Mac has always been about an amazing collection of songs that are performed with a unique blend of talents.We jammed with Mike and Neil and the chemistry really worked and let the band realise that this is the right combination to go forward with in Fleetwood Mac style.We know we have something new, yet it’s got the unmistakable Mac sound.The group saluted the arrival of their new members.“We are thrilled to welcome the musical talents of the calibre of Mike Campbell and Neil Finn into the Mac family. With Mike and Neil, we’ll be performing all the hits that the fans love, plus we’ll be surprising our audiences with some tracks from our historic catalogue of songs,” the band\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp“Fleetwood Mac has always been a creative evolution. We look forward to honouring that spirit on this upcoming tour.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe traffic misdirection, known as a border gateway protocol (BGP) hijacking, lasted for around an hour and a half on Monday evening, ending at around 10.30pm GMT.ThousandEyes\u0026nbspexecutive Alex Henthorn-Iwane\u0026nbspsaid it was the worst incident affecting Google traffic that his firm had ever seen. He also speculated that the hijacking may have been the result of a war-game experiment.The incident\u0026nbspwas particularly suspicious because internet\u0026nbsptraffic was being sent to the Chinese government’s\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprovider, China Telecom, which has previously been accused of improperly\u0026nbsprouting\u0026nbsptraffic through China.A report\u0026nbspearlier this year by researchers at the US Naval War College and Tel Aviv University found\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspTelecom has\u0026nbspbeen hijacking internet\u0026nbsptraffic passing through the US and Canada on a regular basis.Conveniently, China Telecom has ten strategically placed, Chinese controlled internet ‘points of presence’4 (PoPs) across the internet backbone of North America, the report\u0026nbspstated.\u0026nbspVast rewards can be reaped from the hijacking, erting, and then copying of information-rich traffic going into or crossing the United States and Canada – often unnoticed and then delivered with only small delays.A Google spokesperson told The Independent: “We’re aware that a portion of internet traffic was affected by incorrect routing of IP addresses, and access to some Google services was impacted. The root cause of the issue was external to Google and there was no compromise of Google services.”In an update to its Google Cloud Status Dashboard, Google said it was conducting an internal investigation in the hope of\u0026nbspmaking\u0026nbspappropriate improvements to help prevent a future recurrence of the issue.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has since been diagnosed with PTSD.The boy, who is referred to as JMB in court, spent several weeks being treated in hospital and is\u0026nbspnow staying at an accommodation centre in the north of France. Staff at the centre said he was “both physically ill and depressed” and was losing weight as a result of being unable to come to Britain.When his aunt travelled from the UK to visit him in April, he seemed to “come alive for the first time”, according to a social worker, who also expressed concern that “he would deteriorate again if he were not allowed to join her in the UK”.\u0026nbspSpeaking from the centre, JMB said: “It feels endless being in this place, there is no time limit to this situation, they always come up with something else to delay the case. I cannot see any future, I do not see any hope.“One of the things I want to do in my life\u0026nbspis to spend a lot of time with my aunt, try to make up for the time that we were separated. I also want to carry out my education, study English. At the moment, I am focused on getting there and then I will dream more.”Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the case demonstrated “the truly shocking and sad reality” of the government’s hostile environment, adding:\u0026nbsp“Their failure to meet our obligations under the Dubs scheme has left child refugees in an increasingly vulnerable situation.”In June, after lawyers from Bhatt Murphy Solicitors lodged legal proceedings on the child’s behalf, the Home Office said\u0026nbsphe would be “swiftly” transferred to the UK to join his\u0026nbspaunt, but that he must first claim asylum in France.But a month after the French authorities\u0026nbspregistered his asylum claim and made a request for the UK to accept him for transfer so he could join his aunt, the young man is still waiting, prolonging the two years of\u0026nbspuncertainty\u0026nbspand causing him “serious distress”, according to his solicitor.JMB is said to have left Eritrea aged 15 to avoid persecution, and experienced being kidnapped, beaten and starved during his journey to Europe. He witnessed\u0026nbsppeople drown when the boat he\u0026nbspcrossed\u0026nbspthe Mediterranean in almost sank.A mental health assessment for the boy states: “Mentally and physically, his health appears to have deteriorated since at least his arrival in France, culminating in his contracting tuberculosis and pneumonia last summer and being hospitalised for several weeks.”Government’s treatment of child refugees under Dubs scheme broke lawIt adds that he is “very underweight and this is worsening” and that “current symptoms of mental illness have a severe impact on his mood, his ability to eat and to interact socially”.The report continues: “There are high immediate risks of him resuming attempts to join his aunt via clandestine means, despite the inherent dangers and risks of further police assaults involved, and the fact that his aunt has urged him not to do so.”Hamish Arnott, JMB and his aunt’s solicitor at Bhatt Murphy, said: “It feels as though the Home Office is playing games with JMB who has now been waiting for over two years to join his aunt in the UK.\u0026nbsp“JMB complied with the Home Office’s expedited process after the demolition of the Calais Jungle yet, as the courts have found, was subject to an unfair process and was unfairly refused transfer to reunite with his aunt.\u0026nbsp“He was then told, after we lodged legal proceedings on his behalf, that all he had to do was claim asylum in France, that the UK had already secured France’s agreement to make a request for him to be transferred to the UK to join his aunt, and that the Home Office would process that request swiftly.\u0026nbspCalais child refugees refused by Home Office ‘being exploited in UK’“It has now been over four weeks since France made that request while he waits on tenterhooks. The Home Office is treating him unfairly once again in failing to stick to their promise to decide his request quickly. This is causing my extremely vulnerable young client serious distress.”Beth Gardiner-Smith, chief executive of Safe Passage, which has been supporting JMB, said: “After refusing JMB under a process later found to be unlawful, the Home Office should be acting quickly to reunite him with his aunt. Instead, he was left homeless in Calais, suffering from severe trauma.“Having promised to act expeditiously the Home Office is now stalling. JMB has suffered over two years of limbo and distress trying to reunite with his aunt. We’re urging the ministers to now keep their promise, expedite his case and finally reunite this family.”Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said the case was “yet another tragic consequence of the Home Office’s toxic culture”.Created with Sketch.Refugees welcome here: Protesters demand UK resettle more migrants in response to refugee crisis Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Solidarity With Refugees group said Saturday’s protest aimed to “show our Government and the world that Britain is ready to welcome more refugees”.People march through central London as they take part in a protest rally organised by Solidarity with Refugees in a bid to urge the Government to take more action on the migrant crisisThe protest comes days before world leaders meet to discuss crisis at UN General AssemblyDemonstrators made their way from Park Lane to Parliament Square in London on Saturday afternoonMarchers chanted “refugees are welcome here” and waved banners reading “no-one is illegal” and “let’s help people”The march was supported by charities and groups including the Red Cross, Asylum Aid, Save the Children, Hope Not Hate, Oxfam and the UN Refugee AgencyIn the wake of Alan’s death, David Cameron pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK over the coming five years but there have been additional calls to re-home those who have already reached Europe, as well as asylum seekers coming from other conflict zones such as Iraq and AfghanistanThe Solidarity With Refugees group said Saturday’s protest aimed to “show our Government and the world that Britain is ready to welcome more refugees”.People march through central London as they take part in a protest rally organised by Solidarity with Refugees in a bid to urge the Government to take more action on the migrant crisisThe protest comes days before world leaders meet to discuss crisis at UN General AssemblyDemonstrators made their way from Park Lane to Parliament Square in London on Saturday afternoonMarchers chanted “refugees are welcome here” and waved banners reading “no-one is illegal” and “let’s help people”The march was supported by charities and groups including the Red Cross, Asylum Aid, Save the Children, Hope Not Hate, Oxfam and the UN Refugee AgencyIn the wake of Alan’s death, David Cameron pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK over the coming five years but there have been additional calls to re-home those who have already reached Europe, as well as asylum seekers coming from other conflict zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan“The Tories are failing to uphold Britain’s commitment to child refugees, leaving vulnerable young people homeless and unprotected,” he added.Sarah Jones, MP for Croydon Central, said:\u0026nbsp“Children who have fled war and persecution remain trapped for years in a living nightmare in countries they thought would be safe. \u0026nbsp“I’ve seen with my own eyes the hostile environment these young unaccompanied children are facing.

This requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship,” deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said, according to the note seen by The Times newspaper.May calls in ministers to approve deal reached by UK negotiators“They must align their rules but the EU will retain all the controls. They apply the same rules. UK wants a lot more from future relationship, so EU retains its leverage.”\u0026nbspThe binding clauses would mean the UK would be tied to EU rules on workers’ rights, environmental protections, and state aid while the so-called backstop applies – which everyone in Brussels believes it will for quite some time.The provisions are enraging some Tory Brexiteers, who see Britain’s departure from the EU as an opportunity to strip out what they see as excessive regulations and rights for workers.“She hasn’t so much struck a deal as surrendered to Brussels and given in to everything they want and tried to frustrate Brexit that it’s not so much a vassal state anymore as a slave state,” unofficial rebellion leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said, articulating the views of many of Ms May’s MPs.Government forced to publish secret Brexit legal adviceUK travellers will not need visas to visit the EU in no-deal BrexitBut speaking on Wednesday morning Theresa May loyalist William Hague urged Tories to ignore the “leak overnight from somebody you have never heard of before” and to back the plan, arguing that Brexit could be thwarted if it was ditched.The leaked written account of the meeting seen by the newspaper also suggests\u0026nbspthat Britain “would have to swallow a link between access to products and fisheries in future agreements” for the future relationship. The claim is political dynamite because some Brexiteers want the UK to be able to exclude EU fishing boats from British waters after the country leaves.Cabinet ministers are being strong-armed to support the deal, with some deemed “key” to its approval call in for one-on-one meetings with the Prime Minister ahead of a moment-of-truth meeting on Wednesday.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

In a statement, the European Commission said: “The European Commission has today proposed to grant UK citizens visa-free travel to the EU after the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.“It would mean that UK citizens would not need a visa when travelling to the Schengen area for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. In the scenario where the UK leaves the EU without a deal, this would apply as of 30 March 2019. If a deal is reached, however, it would apply as of the end of the transition period, as outlined in the withdrawal agreement. This follows the commission’s continued commitment that citizens’ rights must come first in the negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.“This proposal is entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states, in line with the principle of visa reciprocity. The UK government has declared its intention not to require a visa from citizens of the EU27 member states for shorts stays for the purposes of tourism and business. EU rules on non-EU nationals travelling to the EU, such as those on border control, would of course apply to UK citizens once they are no longer EU citizens.”The visa-free policy covers the 22 EU member countries that are members of the Schengen area and the four\u0026nbspSchengen-associated states – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\u0026nbspIt will also apply to Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus, which are outside Schengen but coordinate their policies with it.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was followed by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom.They emerged from Number 10 tight-lipped after each spending around half an hour with the Prime Minister.Cabinet ministers were also invited to read copies of the draft document in a secure room in the Cabinet Office.Westminster was plunged into feverish speculation yesterday afternoon as news of a technical deal between the two negotiating teams began to emerge from Brussels.After several days of talks between officials in Belgian capital that ran into the early hours, officials finally hammered out a potential solution to the row over the future of the Northern Ireland border that had turned into the key stumbling block in the talks.Sources close to the talks said the\u0026nbspbreak through\u0026nbspwas finally achieved when the EU back down over contentious details in the plan for a so-called Northern Ireland backstop which could have imposed customs checks on goods\u0026nbsptravelling\u0026nbspbetween Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.The deal contains a UK-wide backstop. After extensive debates, the demands that would have effectively meant customs checks in the Irish Sea have been dropped, said one source close to the UK negotiating team.Other sources said a review mechanism had been agreed to ensure the temporary backstop could not become permanent.Cabinet ministers met Mrs May at Downing Street for one-to-one talks (Image: REUTERS)But it was unclear whether the mechanism would satisfy warnings from Eurosceptic Tories that the backstop could lead to the UK being indefinitely tied into a swathe of EU regulations that Parliament will have no say over.Official confirmation from the Government that the draft agreement had been finalised came at 5pm yesterday when a statement from Downing Street said: Cabinet will meet at 2pm tomorrow to consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps.Cabinet Ministers have been invited to read documentation ahead of that meeting.The draft deal is understood to include a 500-page withdrawal agreement and a four-page political declaration about the UK\u0027s future relationship with the EU.Scottish Secretary David Mundell, one of the first Cabinet ministers to speak out about the deal, gave it a cautious welcome while warning details could prove problematic.Obviously members of the Cabinet are going to have the opportunity to look at that in detail this evening and there will be a special Cabinet meeting tomorrow to reflect on what\u0027s in that documentation, he said.So I\u0027m encouraged, but we need to reflect on that detail and see what\u0027s there and hopefully be in a position to take forward a deal.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith was confident the Prime Minister will get Commons backing for the deal.I am confident that we will get this through Parliament and that we can deliver on what the Prime Minister committed to on delivering Brexit, he said.The negotiation team have been working through the night for the last few weeks and we\u0027re hopefully on the cusp of beginning to get to the point where we are delivering on Brexit in a really practical way.Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was \u0027confident\u0027 Mrs May\u0027s deal would pass through the Commons (Image:  IMAGES)But in a sign of the dangerous Commons isions ahead, MPs in the Democratic Unionist Party, crucial allies to Mrs May\u0027s minority Tory government, were understood to be furious about the plans.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that the deal as reported would leave Northern Ireland subject to the rules and laws set in Brussels with no democratic input or any say.He added: We object to that on constitutional grounds that our laws would be made in Brussels, not in Westminster or Belfast. That is the fundamental red line.He warned that the deal could be a \u0026ldquobreach of the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos pledges to the people of Northern Ireland and urged Cabinet ministers to stand behind the Union.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith warned that if reports of the deal\u0027s contents were true the Government was breaking their own agreed position and will be bringing back something that is untenable.He added that if the Cabinet agrees it, the party certainly won\u0027t.Asked if the Government\u0027s days were numbered he said: If this is the case almost certainly, yes.Because they are in real trouble if they bring back something that is unacceptable to the party.The Government puts itself in an impossible position, because they are trying to promote something they themselves said they would never promote. And that makes it impossible.How can you ask the party to vote for something which you yourself as Prime Minister and the Cabinet said they would never ever allow?Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: We will look at the details of what has been agreed when they are available. But from what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country.Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy - and that guarantees standards and protections. If this deal doesn\u0027t meet our six tests and work for the whole country, then we will vote against it.Former EU exit secretary David Davis said last night: This is the moment of truth. This is the fork in the road.Do we pursue a future as an independent nation or accept EU domination, imprisonment in the customs union and second-class status?Cabinet and all Conservative MPs should stand up, be counted and say no to this capitulation.Andrea Leadsom, one of the Eurosceptic ministers who has raised concerns about Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plans in recent weeks, had a good discussion with the Prime Minister last night and will be at today\u0027s Cabinet meeting for further talks with colleagues today, according to a ministerial source.

Theresa May was understood to have told friends last night: This is a deal that delivers for the millions of people who voted to leave the EU.

But a reconsideration in the light of all we now know, accepted by all as the final word, especially if accompanied by a new willingness on the part of Europe\u0027s leadership and Britain\u0027s to deal with the reasons for the Brexit decision, is the only hope of unity in the future.It is frankly gut-wrenching that this call is not being led by Labour as it should be.Brexit deal latest: Boris Johnson urged Cabinet ministers to quit in a furious tirade (Image: )8.45am update:\u0026nbsp\u0026lsquoNorthern Ireland MUST NOT be cut adrift\u0026rsquo - DUP\u0026rsquos Foster issues May warningDUP leader Arlene Foster warned she won\u0026rsquot accept a Brexit deal that treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest to the UK.Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos party\u0026rsquos 10 MPs would reject the draft text of the withdrawal agreement if it tied the province to EU rules, she said.A draft deal agreed this week between EU leaders and the UK suggested Northern Ireland could remain aligned to Brussels regulations, Ms Foster believed.She told Sky News: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a question of whether we are separating the union, whether we are dealing with the United Kingdom in a way that leaves us adrift in the future and as the leader of unionism in Northern Ireland I\u0027m not about to agree to that.8.30am update:\u0026nbspBoris Johnson calls on Cabinet ministers to quit in furious Brexit tiradeBoris Johnson has urged Cabinet ministers to resign over Theresa May\u0026rsquos draft Brexit deal, urging them to \u0026ldquochuck it out as it is \u0026ldquoabout as bad as it could possibly be.The former former foreign Secretary vowed to vote against the deal in Parliament.He told the BBC: For the first time in a thousand years, this place, this Parliament, will not have a say over the laws that govern this country.

Tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) define the volume of sensitive goods, such as meat and cheese, that other World Trade Organisation (WTO) members can export to Europe. They set the amounts of goods that can be imported at low or zero tariffs, as opposed to full WTO rates that can often exceed 100 percent.                \u0027It\u0027s Britain versus EU!\u0027 UK Fishermen FURIOUS at Brussels over quotas                EU kickstart CRUCIAL Brexit talks to decide Britain\u0027s WTO futureLast year, Brussels and London came up with a joint plan that involved iding the current quotas based on consumption patterns.This means the UK would take a larger quota for products such as New Zealand lamb, where it accounts for much of the European Union demand.Both parties want endorsement of the plan from the WTO before Brexit takes effect from March 29, 2019.But the group of countries used Monday\u0026rsquos meeting in Geneva to complain they would still lose out because the quota splits would reduce flexibility for exporters used to exporting to a single 28-country market.EU news: The US are one of many countries objecting to the EU\u0027s quota plans post-Brexit (Image: )One official told the Financial Times that Australia warned at the meeting splitting TRQs risked being too small to be commercially viable, while the US rejected the proposals on the basis that exporters would be worse off.A group of 12 countries, also including China, Brazil and Mexico, put together a draft note before yesterday\u0026rsquos meeting outlining what they thought were the problems with the EU plan, in addition to other nations raising their concerns.The rejection of the plan is the latest blow for the EU and a sign of how big trade powers are intensifying their demands over the UK\u0026rsquos imminent exit from the bloc should be managed - both short and long-term.Both parties have been working together over recent months around how to share out the TRQs, which are particularly valuable to agricultural exporters such as Argentina and New Zealand, and also the powerful farm lobby in the US.It is also a hugely important issue for Brussels and London, as the result of talks will determine how much competition farmers from within the EU and specifically the UK will face.But failure to find a solution at the WTO over how to split the TRQs could even trigger legal challenges from several of the EU\u0026rsquos trading partners.

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s also available as a free PDF.I’ve been surprised at how many grown-ups have downloaded it to go through it with their kids, but ended up telling me they’ve learned something too.Companies spend billions advertising, marketing and teaching their staff to sell, yet we don’t get ANY buyers’ training. That needs to change. Yet the textbook by itself won’t do that.Soyou’re a parent, politely ask a teacher or headteacherthey got the textbook . . .  and plan to use it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its a very important year.At the minute, he keeps coming home with more and more issues and its getting ridiculous. I dont see how the school can enforce this - they are treating pupils like prisoners.Sir Robert Pattinson Academy stands by its decision to ban drinking in the school and says its for the benefit of the pupils.Head teacher at the school Dale Hardy said: We have stopped students drinking in lessons and this is accurate.But we have done so for very clear health and safety reasons.“Many classrooms and IT suites have electrical equipment and the advice we have been given is that having liquids present, which can be spilled or splashed, is a risk to the students and we take the safety of our pupils very seriously.“Students are able to drink between classes, in break times and in other areas of the school without restriction.“All of these measures are designed to create a safe and disciplined school environment in which learning can thrive.“The vast majority of parents support measures that protect their children and eliminate the kind of disruption that prevents them from realising their full potential.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000000660554.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"darpa tech us government","story":"A top-secret US government body called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencyis behind these space-age innovations, which it has developed as part of its mission to revolutionise the way America fights the wars of the future. .Ever since it was established in , DARPA has been the subject of conspiracy theories claiming - among other things - that the agency was covering up UFO landings, trying to develop mind control and working on Earth-shattering super-weapons like death rays.However, as far-fetched as these claims may be, the truth is that DARPA has already developed new technologies which are just as fantastical and which are just as likely to change the world – perhaps beyond recognition.Meanwhile, the quest to give the US military an unbeatable edge has also led to DARPA developing a number of practical technologies which we now use every day: GPS, Google Maps and even the internet all have their origins in DARPA’s secretive labs.But with DARPA’s current controversial projects including unchecked AI software and the potential for weaponised insects, there’s no doubt that these innovations of the future can be just as influential.Imagine the incredible potential of a sniper bullet that changes its trajectory after it’s been fired, guaranteeing that the shooter never misses.EXACTO, or Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance bullets does exactly this, turning huge . caliber bullets into guided rounds capable of zeroing in on a target.The idea is that this can nully inaccuracies caused by bad weather, wind, extreme distances or human error.Although DARPA is keeping quiet on how it does this, other sites report that the technology involves optical sensors in the nose of the bullet and fins capable of adjusting the bullet’s flight path in the tail.The bullet is even capable of making some remarkably sharp course corrections.DARPA claims that the system is so easy to use that, during testing, a novice shooter using the system for the first time was able to squarely hit a moving target.Coming soon to a battlefield near you: DARPA has developed an incredible exoskeleton - a wearable mobile machine - which transforms any infantryman into a super soldier.Made with help from researchers at Hard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, DARPA’s Soft Exosuit is a lightweight skeleton frame which saves soldiers’ energy when going about their battlefield business.The sci-fi exoskeleton can augment its wearer’s strength and endurance by assisting with movements and taking on some of the physical burdens of walking over long distances and carrying heavy objects, using in-built sensors and a micro-computer to intelligently match the requirements of its user.A new study, where the suit was tested by seven soldiers on a -mile cross-country hike in Maryland, showed it reduced energy consumption by around  per cent, making troops more efficient and able to cover more ground.One of DARPA’s big interests is the baffling world of articial intelligence – smart computers which are capable of thinking in a similar way to humans.Dr Steven Walker, the director at the head of the controversial agency, is currently funnelling a  billioninvestment into exploring how machines can be taught to communicate and reason in the same way we do.The aim is to create lightning-fast military computers which can adapt to new situations, analyse battlefield data and ultimately advise soldiers and planners in the heat of a conflict, where every second counts.However, AI has its critics, who warn that turning over the work of military analysis to machines creates the risk of a Skynet-style computer which could turn its considerable knowledge and power against humanity.AI expert Professor Michael Horowitz, from the University of Pennsylvania, has said in interviews: “There’s a lot of concern about AI safety – [about] algorithms that are unable to adapt to complex reality and thus mal in unpredictable ways.“It’s one thingwhat you’re talking about is a Google search, but it’s another thingwhat you’re talking about is a weapons system.”Other DARPA research projects include the creation of prosthetic limbs with the full range of movement of the real thing.Geoff Ling, a neurology ICU physician, has even developed a mind-controlled prosthetic arm which the wearer controls with their thoughts.Other incredible prosthetic limbs created by the research agency can offer a range of natural movements which the wearer controls via sensors placed where on their body.However, conspiracy theorists claim that this is just cover for plans to develop better and more sophisticated fake limbs which can eventually be fitted to robot soldiers and other war machines.This is something which Ling has publicly denied, stating that the US government has put limits on DARPA’s powers to develop killer robots or a “super-person”.One of DARPA’s most controversial recent projects, Insect Allies, is designed to stop insects from being pests and harness their powers for good.The idea is that leafhoppers, white flies and aphids can be used to protect the nations food supply in the face of threats caused by drought, crop disease and bio-terrorism.DARPA aims to achieve this by deliberately infecting insects with engineered viruses and mutations which can then be passed on to plants to make them hardier or resistant to biological attacks.However, to some people the idea of using insects as farming tools isn’t as innocent as it sounds.Blake Bextine, who runs the project, acknowledged that Insect Allies involves new technologies that potentially could be used, in theory, as a novel weapon .But the program manager told the Washington Post that almost all new technologies are capable of being weaponised. “I don’t think that the public needs to be worried,” he added. “I don’t think that the international community needs to be worried.”Some of DARPA’s most incredible military research centres on the deadliest of weapons: the human mind.Under Justin Sanchez, head of the Biological Technologies Office at DARPA, the organisation has funded human experiments at Wake Forest, the University of Southern Calornia, and the University of Pennsylvania, with the aim of giving iniduals a memory “boost.”Researchers implanted electrodes into one person’s brain to record mental activity associated with recognising patterns and memorising word lists.Then they reinforced that person’s memory by playing back the recorded brain activity through the circuits, signicantly improving their memory.However, many people have questioned these findings, including former DARPA program manager Doug Weber.He explained to The Atlantic that when scientists put electrodes in the brain, those devices eventually fail—after a few months or a few years, mainly because of blood leakage.Many of DARPA’s innovations take existing technologies and apply them in a practical military setting, and their Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel is no dferent.This long-winded name refers to the agency’s -ton drone boat which cruises the oceans tracking enemy submarines and detecting mines.The unmanned minesweeper can continuously operate for - days with no human intervention necessary, and has already been successfully trialled at sea.The Phantom Express – or XS- – is a next-generation space craft which will allow secret missions to the final frontier to be launched on a daily basis.Set to take off for the first time in , the mysterious plane is thought to be powered only by electricity, and is expected to have the ability to land and take off vertically.It will take off like a rocket, boost itself beyond the atmosphere and release an expendable second-stage rocket and satellite before turning around and landing like an aeroplane on a runway.DARPA spokesman Jared Adams said the goal of the XS- program is to fly  flights within ten days.DARPA’s SIGMA program was developed with the goal of minimising casualties in the event of a worst-case scenario: a nuclear or radiological attack against the United States.In , DARPA put its cutting-edge vehicle-mounted radiation detectors to the test in Washington, D.C by fitting them to the city’s fleet of emergency service vehicles.This turned every ambulance, fire engine and police car in the city into mobile nuke snfers, providing the first ever city-scale map of background radiation levels throughout the US capital as well as identying any unusual spikes that could indicate a threat.With the ever-present threat of war weighing heavy over American military planners, more tests are planned in the coming year... and theres no knowing what other incredible projects DARPA has in the pipeline.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many children are seeing their parents orce, start new cohabiting relationships, and having those end as well.The findings are said to explain why some blokes seem unwilling or unable to settle down.“All of these relationships can influence childrens outcomes, as we see in this study.”The number of kids living with cohabiting adults has more than doubled in the UK from seven per cent in  to  per cent in .Those living with a married couple fell by nine percentage points of the same period to  per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.Dr Kamp Dush added: “You may see cohabitation as an attractive, lower-commitment type of relationshipyouve seen your mother in such a relationship for a longer time.That may lead to more partners since cohabitating relationships are more likely to break-up.“What our results suggest is that mothers may pass on their marriageable characteristics and relationship skills to their children – for better or worse.“It could be that mothers who have more partners dont have great relationship skills, or dont deal with conflict well, or have mental health problems.“Each of these can undermine relationships and lead to instability.“Whatever the exact mechanisms, they may pass these characteristics on to their children, making their children’s relationships less stable.”The findings are published in the journal PLOS ONE."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449160532.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu army emmanuel macron angela merkel latest","story":"Merkel declared there should be an integrated European Union military, recalling the lessons of the First World War and the isions that led to the conflict.Speaking to MEPs today about the future of Europe, Merkel said the continent should take its fate fully into its own hands.Echoing comments made by French leader Emmanuel Macron last week, she said: We should work on a vision of one day establishing a real, true European army.Merkel added that such an army would not undermine the US-led military alliance NATO but could be complementary to it. It should include common development of arms industry, she said as well as an EU-wide arms export policy and crucially a European intervention force.It came a day after a senior minister from the French Government called for the EU to become a powerful new “empire” to rival the US and China in an interview which will infuriate Donald Trump.Merkels remarks today in the EU parliament drew loud applause in the legislature but also boos from euro-sceptic members.One of them was chief Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who said: Its a European Union that we are told is now to become an empire - a militarised European Union.A European Union that has launched a new Cold against the United States of America.One hundreds years on from the Armistice we should genuinely be worried.The idea that this new militarised union is somehow a recipe for peace I suggest you sit back and think a little bit more carefully.Maybe you should all re-read history because the European project was set up to stop German domination and what you have seen today is a naked take-over bid.Yesterday French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Europe must be strong enough to defend itself in the future - words the US president called insulting.Le Maire controversial calls for a new superstate came as he backed Macron’s and Merkels plan for a “real European army”.Le Maire suggested Brussels should go one even further and establish itself as an “empire”.Its about Europe having to become a kind of Empire, as China is. And how the US is, the French finance minister told the German newspaper Handelsblatt.After being quizzed by the newspaper on his comments, he added: “Do not get me wrong, Im talking about a peaceful empire thats a constitutional state.I use the term to raise awareness that the world of tomorrow will be about power.Power will make a dference: technological power, economic, financial, monetary, cultural power will be crucial.Trump has blasted Macrons idea for the European Union to build an army to protect itself from the US as insulting.The US President tweeted: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidises greatly!It comes three days after the French President said the US is as big a threat to the EU as Russia and China and called for a “true European army” to defend the bloc.In an extraordinary attack on the US president, Macron lumped Washington together with Moscow and Beijing as Europe’s biggest foes.The arch euro federalist insisted only a fully fledged EU defence force can protect the continent against the trio’s aggression.He said: “We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.“We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.”The French president lashed Mr Trump for deciding to pull the US out of a nuclear treaty with Russia that was signed during the Cold War.He raged: “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim  Europe and its security.”Mr Macron made the comments in a radio interview from the town of Verdun - the site of a major WW battle - as he tours the Western Front ahead of Remembrance Day.They were welcomed by the EU Commission, which said it has already put the wheels in motion for the eventual creation of a euro army.A spokesman beamed: “If there is a Commission that has put forward the need for a meaningful defence identity for the EU, it’s this Commission.“President Macron has been consistently putting forward this narrative for a stronger Europe that empowers and protects.“This is totally totally compatible with our work and all contributions from our EU leaders, and especially from President Macron, are very much welcome.”But the remarks were savaged by former British Army commanders, who said the revelations showed why the UK must pull out of the EU’s defence plans.Major General Julian Thompson, who led British forces in the Falklands, told The Sun: “The EU Commission now openly admits it has created the preamble to an EU army.The UK is in that preamble and risks being kept in it.“Ministers must withdraw or risk losing forever whole chunks of the UK’s democratic control over defence.”Colonel Richard Kemp, a commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added: “This is precisely what eurosceptics have been warning about.“It is time for ministers now to take notice and rein in what they have agreed since the referendum.They have been led astray in the most crucial area of sovereignty.”And Tory MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, a former British Army Brigadier, raged: “Instead of th century dreams of French-led European grandeur, President Macron should be helping build Western solidarity.“That means helping and not obstructing a strong partnership with Britain and strengthening the NATO alliance.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000248408276.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits wont need a visa to travel to europe even if we get a no deal brexit eu confirms","story":"UK citizens will be able to visit the EU for up to three months at a time without having to get new documents -

The former prime minister will say it is gut-wrenching that Labour is not leading the call for a second referendum. And he will condemn the stupidity of the far left for denigrating the record of the New Labour years in government. In a speech in London, Mr Blair will argue that left-wing populism is not the answer to populism on the right and instead the progressive centre must recognise and address the anxieties which have fuelled the phenomenon. Theresa May faces biggest fight of political le as she sells Brexit deal to CabinetOn Brexit, Mr Blair will repeat his call for a second referendum because Theresa Mays proposals - Brexit in name but tied still to Europe in reality - will disappoint those on both sides. Whatever the people voted for, they didnt vote for this, he will say. I know it is said a new vote of the people will also ide. But a reconsideration in the light of all we now know, accepted by all as the final word, especiallyaccompanied by a new willingness on the part of Europes leadership and Britains to deal with the reasons for the Brexit decision, is the only hope of unity in the future. It is frankly gut-wrenching that this call is not being led by Labour as it should be. Brexit deal agreed with Brussels as Theresa May holds emergency Cabinet meetingIn a defence of his record, Mr Blair will say: The denigration of the Labour Party record in government and its designation by the far left as neo-liberal is one of the most absurd and self-defeating caricatures of modern political history. The Labour Party has paid, but more importantly the country has paid, a heavy price for this stupidity. It has undermined the achievements of the party in government. It has weakened the Labour Partys ability to win by depriving it of a unying message which can reach the centre ground and led to the abject refusal of the Labour leadership to lead the country out of the Brexit nightmare. In pointed remarks about Mr Corbyns leadership, the former premier will say populist parties on the left seldom win power. Angela Merkel confirms Brexiteers worst fears by backing European ArmySumming up the current position, he will add: In Britain, we have a Government which is in complete disarray making a mess of the most signicant decision this country has taken since the war. Yet the Labour Party is barely ahead in the polls and its leaderships ratings languish well behind those of the Prime Minister, who herself faces daily speculation about her position and is highly unlikely to lead them into the next election.

But now, three weeks after the crash which nearly killed him and changed the lives of he and his partner Nicola Boraston, the couple have been overwhelmed by an outpouring of support from family, friends and strangers in Bristol and beyond. A GoFundMe page set up to help Ed and his family when he is eventually discharged from hospital has already smashed its initial target three times over, and his friends say there will be huge financial and emotional implications for the rest of their lives from the shocking events in Bristol three weeks ago. Bristol Live reports that Ed and Nic were walking home at around .am on October , when they were passed by a car being driven up the hill ahead of them. The car then began to reverse at speed towards them and swerved off the road.  Ed, from Bristol said he leapt into the path of the car to push Nic out of the way. She suffered only minor injuries, but the back of the car pinned Ed to a retaining wall of a garden, crushing his left leg and pelvis, before moving forward and allowing the wall to collapse on top of him. The -year-old suffered such terrible injuries that he medically died in the ambulance rushing him to hospital and had to be resuscitated by paramedics. He underwent  hours of surgery, and spent two weeks in intensive care at Southmead Hospital. Surgeons were unable to save his left leg, and had to amputate it just below the hip. He now faces months of recovery in hospital from his shattered pelvis and years of rehabilitation. “I remember the car hitting me, but I don’t really remember anything too much after that,” he said. “I have spent most of my working le in care work so it feels weird and a challenge to switch to being cared for now.” Police arrested the driver, a man aged  who has not been named, at the scene and later released him on bail.

The Home Office confirmed today that it has allocated the money to allow Scotland Yard to continue its investigation until March. Madeleine was three when she vanished while on holiday with her parents in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May . Scotland Yard launched its own investigation, Operation Grange, into her disappearance in , after a Portuguese inquiry failed to make any headway. Force bosses have been applying for funding from the Home Office every six months to continue the inquiry, that has cost about pound. million so far.  Madeleines parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, have always pledged never to give up the search for their daughter. A Home Office spokesman said: We have confirmed that Special Grant funding of pound, will be provided to the politan Police Service for the six-month period to  March . A former counter-terror detective previously said it is vitally important to keep searching for the girl over  years later. Speaking on Good Morning Britain , David Videcette said Met Police must be given more funding to discover what happened to Maddie. He said: If she had been abducted, then we need to catch whoever did that because it will happen again.  However much money we spend on this case, well save on the next casewe catch that person and thats where we need to look at. The sum that has already been spent on the McCann investigation has sparked public debate, with some critics claiming there are many other missing children who havent been given the same resources.  Also on GMB was founding member of Scotland Yards undercover unit, Peter Bleksley who argued it was dficult to justy spending more when police appear to be no closer to finding Maddie. He said: There has to be a point where they say you know what we have to put this file in the too dficult tray because quite frankly we are unable to solve it. How much more money has to be ploughed into this, are there still live investigate threads that are going to potentially lead to some kind of resolution  years on  At some stage, this has to stop.  Meanwhile, Videcette insisted money shouldnt be an issue, adding: Good investigations take time. Madeleine - daughter of doctors Kate and Gerry McCann - was nearly four when she went missing from their holiday apartment in Praia da Lua.  The couple were dining in the holiday complexs restaurant while Maddie and her siblings were sleeping in the nearby apartment.

Women across the globe are desperate to copy her looks and get their hands on whatever clothes she wears. Dubbed the Duchess effect her outfits usually sell out within hours of her being photographed in them. But even the most fashion forward of people can still slip up sometimes - something the Duchess of Sussex proved to be true over the weekend.  The expectant mother accompanied her husband and other family members to the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday November . On first glance the -year-old looked incredibly chic in a black Stella McCartney coat dress, which cleverly hid her baby bump thanks to a big bow. She wore her dark hair down, tucked behind her ears and paired the dress with a black clutch and heels. But people couldnt help notice that something about her ensemble was a little odd - and its all to do with her tights.  Meghan, who has famously opted to forgo wearing hosiery thus far, decided to put on a pair of shiny, nude tights for the event. And many people on social media were bemused by the way they looked. One person wrote: Meghan rewearing her fab Stella McCartney coat from Cardf visit, but I cannot get over the glare of these tights. Another said: What has happened to Meghan Markles tights  Has she spilt her wine   However others found this criticism incredibly offensive and highlighted how dficult it can be to find tights that match your skin colour. I feel so sorry for Meghan Markle because her every move is scrutinized because shes American, a commoner older and biracial. Now they are talking about her nude colour tights. They dont exactly match her skin tone. Well, this is a COMMON problem for women of colour, argued one Twitter user. Another added: Do we really have nothing better to talk about on Remembrance Day than Meghans tights  This isnt the first time the duchess has come under fire for her choice of hosiery.  In May, she wore a similar pair of tights to Prince Charles th birthday party at Buckingham Palace and was also criticised for them. She has since been seen stepping out in public with bare legs. Some have suggested that the decision to cover her skin may not have been her own - as it is commonly thought that the Queen has an unwritten rule about guests and family members wearing tights at royal events. However Marlene Koenig, royal expert and Royal Musings blog founder, told BAZAAR this isnt actually true. She said: There are no rules for royal women regarding pantyhose. While most womenwear pantyhouse with suits or gowns for a good slim line, it is not required by any decree from the Queen. What do you think of Meghans tights  Let us know in the comments below.

Buthe’s also in the Royal Family, that usually means a row of chairs in a Buckingham Palace drawing room and glum kids rigid with boredom. So the official photos marking the Prince of Wales’ th birthday are truly a breath of fresh air. They capture the smiling face of a modern monarchy, and the loving bond between Charles and his close-knit clan. The heir to the throne sits on a bench beaming, surrounded by his family.  And, while that bench is probably hand-carved oak and the Clarence House lawn freshly mown by a gardener, the Wales-Cornwall-Cambridge-Sussexes really look like a NORMAL happy family. One touching shot shows them collapsing in giggles at something happening behind the camera. Gangly Prince George, five, who is perched on his Grandpapa’s knee, roars with laughter while Camilla cuddles smiling Princess Charlotte, three, pointing out the incident.  Harry, with his arm round his we’s waist, sees it too and pregnant Meghan doubles over laughing. Sensible William keeps his eye on the photographer, probably urging the others to get a grip, while smiling Kate bounces a chubby-legged Prince Louis, six months. And while dapper Charles is wearing one of his Savile Row pin-stripes, his sons are informally dressed in open-necked shirts.  They are the picture of a loving and devoted family. This week William and Harry paid a moving tribute to Papa in a TV documentary marking his birthday. And the pair, who grew closer than ever to their father following the tragic death of Princess Diana, said they wanted him to be a big part in their own children’s lives. Camilla, also interviewed for the programme, said: “He’s wonderful with children. He doesn’t mind crawling on the floor for hours with them. We had a picture the other day with Louis pulling on his hair. He loves it. He’s exceptionally good with very small children and babies.”  Charles has clearly mellowed over the past decade and become more relaxed about family photoshoots. Just before his marriage to Camilla in  he took his sons on a stag do ski trip to the posh resort of Klosters. On a photoshoot the Prince was caught on microphone slating the press and BBC reporter Nicholas Witchell.  Grinning through gritted teeth, he told his sons: “I hate doing this. Bloody people. “I can’t bear that man [Witchell]. He’s so awful, he really is. I hate these people.” Urged by a photographer to “look like you know each other” the boys leaned closer.  Charles grumped: “Do I put my arms round you  What do we do ” William replied: “Keep smiling, keep smiling.” Charles wisely followed the advice and in the  years since has learned much more from William and Harry about showing emotion in public.  At  he seems more comfortable in his skin than ever before. And, as these pictures show, the modern monarchy is facing the future with a smile.

Ellie-Rose Longley-Hall was put in isolation because of the studs and so her mum Katie Marsham, , decided to take her out of Kingwood Academy in Hull. The -year-old had only got her ears pierced two days before and went into school with a pair of gold studs which had small blue diamonds in them. However, staff at the school said she would have to remove the earrings or be forced to work “in consequences” – a form of isolation where pupils are segregated from their classmates. Disgusted by the decision, Mrs Marsham took Ellie-Rose out of school as she did not think she deserved to be punished because of her earrings, reports Hull Live.  The mum-of-four said: “I brought her home because she can’t be sat in there when she should be studying. I think it’s wrong, especially when it’s her last year of school and she has had a lot going on in her le at the minute. “I think it’s childish and a bit over the top, and I’m not sending her back to school so that she can be segregated from the classroom in consequences.” Ellie-Rose plucked up the courage to have her ears pierced last weekend despite having a “fear of needles”. However, her mum said she cannot take them out for another six weeks as they may become infected meaning she may notto school until next year.  Mrs Marsham says her daughter is already “stressed out” by the prospect of facing such a y time out of school and she is worried the Year  pupil could now fail her GCSEs. She said: “Ellie-Rose has got exams coming up and she is supposed to have one on Friday. She is going to fail themshe has to stay out of school that long and I don’t want that to happen because she has been working really hard. “She has just had two weeks off school with illness and that has affected her schoolwork. I don’t want this to affect her either but they’ve said she can’t go back to school until she changes them.” It comes after the school told at least three boys to get their hair cut or be put in isolation.  Leroy and TJ Wilson were told their hairdos did not meet unorm policy with Bradley Thompson’s mum also told by the school to sort out his hair or find another school. Leroy and TJ’s mother, Terri Lea Wilson, branded the school’s decision to put them “in consequences” as “cruel and “ridiculous.” Kingswood Academy says it expects the highest standards from its pupils when it comes to school unorms. Anyone who fails to meet these expectations is placed in isolationthey do not recty the issue. A spokesman for the academy said: We at the academy have the highest of expectations regarding unorm - including jewellery - which have been in place for the last three years.  “These expectations are made very clear in the unorm policy which is shared with parents and students annually, and is also displayed on the academy website. “Any student who fails to meet the standard initially has an opportunity to recty the issue,not they are placed in isolation. “In February , Kingswood Academy was judged to be Good in all categories and Ofsted commented specically on how proud students were of their school and their unorm, which they wear with pride.

Kerry Miles, , says her lips doubled in size after the alleged botched job. She says just an hour after the half-an-hour procedure, her lips were burning and blistered. Kerry later decided to have the lip filler drained and claims a doctor told her the filler appeared to have been mixed with another substance like baby oil. It has since taken Kerry two years to get her lips back to normal after the ordeal, she says. But despite her devastation and pain, the mum-of-one from Chelmsford, Essex, says she isnt deterred from having her lips done.After finding a clinic online that she thought was reputable, Kerry had booked her treatment and paid pound for the lip filler. Kerry, a model and promoter, said: I picked a reputable clinic but I had doubts as soon as I turned up. The house was rundown and looked grubby, there was even a dog running around. It didnt look very hygienic but I wanted my lips done and she had good reviews. She was mixing the filler in front of me and Im certain she was using some sort of household oil.  She added: Ive never had a reaction to filler before but this was horric. I couldnt go outdoors for days as the pain was so bad and I looked awful. I phoned her to complain but she told me I wasnt drinking enough water and I should massage my lips to make them the right shape. When I had the filler drained by a doctor I was told that the filler had been mixed with baby oil, I was so shocked. It has taken years to get them back to normal but thankfully I am now happy with them.  Kerry went on to have more filler to try and disguise her lumpy lips but it took years to dissolve. She added: It wouldnt dissolve like normal filler as it was a mixture of substances. I should never have trusted her with my face. I have also had Botox, vampire facials and a nose job to try and perfect my face. The experience hasnt put me off having my lips done as I still get them done now. Im just extremely careful about who I chose now after everything I went through a few years ago.  Kerrys idol is Barbie and she has spent thousands on procedures to try and improve her looks. She added: I enjoy improving my body and keeping my face looking youthful. I wouldnt warn people not to have lip fillers but I would say do your research. I was left feeling so embarrassed after my ordeal and now Im always over cautious.  Kerry says she conducts background checks on everyone she books for her fillers now. I should have trusted my instincts when the house I arrived at wasnt clean but I learnt the hard way, she said.I hope others can learn from my mistakes.

The trial of El Chapo began with lawyers opening statements in a federal court in Brooklyn late on Tuesday, amid intense public attention and extraordinary security measures. The days hearing was delayed due to an anxious and upset juror who brought a doctors note to court to help get taken off the case. Guzmans attorney Jeffrey Lichtman told the court his client was merely a scapegoat for the real drug cartel leader, Ismael El Mayo Zambada.  Hes blamed for being the leader while the real leaders are living freely and openly in Mexico, attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said. In truth he controlled nothing. Mayo Zambada did. Zambada, who is still at large, had bribed Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, said Lichtman. Pena Nietos spokesman said of the accusation: That is .  Guzman, who dramatically escaped from Mexican maximum security prisons twice, has been kept in solitary confinement in Manhattan and transported to court in Brooklyn in a heavily guarded motorcade. Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Fels laid out the U.S. governments case, describing how prosecutors would prove that Guzman rose from a low-level marijuana trafficker in the s to lead the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, leaving a trail of violence in his wake.  Federal prosecutors say that Guzman, , directed massive shipments of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine bound for the United States. He faces  criminal counts and a potential le sentenceconvicted, and the trial could last up to four months. As well as smuggling drugs to the United States, the Sinaloa Cartel has played a major role in narco violence between rival gangs that has torn areas of Mexico apart. His nickname El Chapo, a reference to his five foot, six inchheight, is often translated in English as shorty. The US Government said they plan to tell El Chapo’s story - part history, part biographical - during the -year-old’s trial in New York.  As well as smuggling drugs to the United States, the Sinaloa Cartel has played a major role in narco violence between rival gangs that has torn areas of Mexico apart and defied successive governments. More than , people have been killed - many in cartel feuds - since the Mexican government sent troops in to take on the drug gangs in . Guzmans lawyers have signaled that they intend to downplay their clients role in the cartel and argue that the prosecutors witnesses are motivated by self interest and not believable.  The security around El Chapo is so strict that US District Judge Brian Cogan, who is presiding over the case, last week denied a motion by Guzman asking to hug his we before the trial. According to court filings, witnesses will include former Sinaloa Cartel members and others involved in the drug trade who are now cooperating with the U.S. government. None have been publicly named, and some may testy under aliases.  The jurors will remain anonymous and be escorted to and from court by armed US marshals. Prosecutors have said the security is necessary because of Guzmans history of intimidating and even ordering murders of potential witnesses. But Guzmans lawyers have called those claims unfounded.  Guzman was one of worlds most wanted fugitives until he was captured in January  in Sinaloa. He was extradited to the US a year later. In , Forbes Magazine put him on its list of the worlds richest people, with an estimated  billion fortune but investigators say it is impossible to know exactly how much he was worth.

The -year-old was born with an extremely rare neurological condition that means she can remember nearly everything that’s ever happened to her in her le. Her first memory is of having her picture taken at  days old. And she can recall the minute details of her first birthday party - from the itchy satin dress she wore to the Minnie Mouse teddy that terried her. While some memories are more vivid than others, Rebecca can always remember the emotions she felt - as well as the tastes and smells she encountered. Her mind is filled with endless flashbacks - from magical Christmases as a child to more hurtful memories of her being bullied at school. The young woman, from Brisbane, Australia, told : “My memories are all in sequence, they come in a chronological order by days and times. “My earliest memory is of having my picture taken at  days old. “I saw a picture of that photo when I was  but I always remembered it and would speak to my mum about it in my early childhood. She was shocked that I could remember and when I saw the photo, it was dated the rd of December  when I was  days old. “It never occurred to me that it wasn’t normal to remember things like that.  Rebecca is one of around only  people in the world who have Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory , or a super memory.While her happy memories are wonderful, she admits it’s tough being able to recall every detail of her le - from what clothes she was wearing to exactly how she felt when something bad or embarrassing happened to her on a certain day. Her over-active mind also causes her to suffer from headaches and insomnia - but she has learned to quieten her mind by reading the Harry Potter novels. She now knows all the books by heart and recites them in her mind to calm her down and help her fall asleep. “The memories make it dficult to get to sleep when it’s dark and silent because I just get distracted, she told us. It happens all through the day but when I’m trying to sleep I just get random flashbacks and it keeps me awake. That’s why I learned to recite the Harry Potter books. While remembering everything certainly has its perks, Rebecca says her mind often feels “overwhelmed” and cluttered with memories. A particularly negative recollection can often ruin her day. She is currently in therapy and is working on ways to repress particularly painful memories and keep the incessant flashbacks at bay. “There are a few memories from my early childhood that are the absolute worst and I hate reliving those, said Rebecca. I want to get rid of those memories because I was going through a phase of depression when I was  and I don’t like reliving those emotions and feelings again. “When they’re negative, I like to call them intrusive memories. It could be a day I was looking forward to but something could remind me of a negative memory and the negative emotions flood back and it just ruins the whole day for me.  “I’ve been doing therapy for the past few years and my therapist has given me exercises to deal with my memories and they’re used for people suffering from PTSD. “One is called leaves on a stream, I just imagine taking every thought out of my mind and putting it on a leaf and it’s floating away. That just grounds my mind. While some of us still cringe at memories from our embarrassing teenage years, they flood back for Rebecca asits happening right then and there all over again. The intense experience can be incredibly painful and dficult to cope with over and over again. “I dream about my past all the time too, and they’re always about my school days, said the young woman. “I just relive the embarrassment of whenever I did something at school. Emotions come back, physical sensations come back, tastes and smells do as well.  Rebecca also tries to centre her mind by drawing her memories or building her Harry potter Lego set. When a memory comes flooding back, she has to fight the urge to respond in the same way she would have at that time of her le. She explained: “The emotions and the adrenaline I getto whatever age I was at the time of the memory but my conscience and reasoning are like an adult. That makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed and reluctant to be open about them because I know it’s an immature reaction or something silly that I don’t need to worry about. It creates a lot of confusion within me. In recent years, Rebecca has been working with neurologists to help with their research into how memory works. “I’m close to my step-dad’s family and his dad passed away two years ago from Alzheimers, she said. He had it for seven years before he passed away and it was just so sad. If there could be a cure, it would be fantastic. And I’m involved in research that helps find the answers and that means a lot to me. Rebecca has met one other woman who has H-SAM and says it was “incredible” to meet someone who has the same experience. “For the person not to be confused or amazed but just to react asit was a normal thing was amazing, she said.We just couldn’t stop talking the first time we met. It’s so amazing to have a friend who knows exactly what I’m talking about.” While she sometimes wishes she didnt have such an incredible memory, the young woman says the happy memories make it worthwhile. Often, it can feel like time travel. I relive happy memories just as much as negative memories, she said “Those are the moments I’m grateful I have H-SAM, I relive holidays I’ve had, I love going to the Disney and Harry Potter parks. “Most of my happiest memories come from my adulthood and not my childhood.  “Most of my happiest memories come from my trips to Calornia. And although she feels her mind is “constantly cluttered”, she has never felt any other way. “It’s something I’ve grown used to but I knowthis happened to me suddenly I’d be absolutely overwhelmed and I wouldn’t cope with it, said Rebecca. “I get a lot of headaches, I get tired a lot but it’s something I’ve just accepted as part of my le. I’ve just grown used to it. “Whenever I’m getting stressed because my head is just going haywire or I’m having an intrusive memory I do wish I didn’t have it but I like to focus on the positive. She added: “I used to look at it like it as a complete curse but now I’m teaching myself to look at the positive side.I don’t have to keep a diary to remember happy events - they’re just there.And it’s also something interesting to talk about - I love being quirky.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Accusations of spies lurking furtively in the shadows. And claims of sabotage as posters advertising a “summit” meeting are mysteriously ripped off walls and hoardings. No – it’s not a meeting of the Klu Klux Klan in Hickory Hollow, Arakansas in the s. And no . . . it’s not a clandestine, cover-up being leaked in the basement of Washington’s Watergate Hotel in the s. This is Troon, South Ayrshire  . . . and the cloak-and-dagger involves the proposed take-over of a community activity centre. It’s Dundonald Gymnastics Clubversus Muirhead Tennants and Residents Association . And in the middle we have SAC. Normally this would mean South Ayrshire Council . . . but in this case, it really stands for Sell All Centres. Andthere’s room for another acronym – let’s throw in the real reason behind this rammy – it’s called C.A.T . . . Community Asset Transfer. SAC wants to get Muirhead Activity Centre – and its running costs – off its books. DCG – a well organised and well funded gymnastic club – would love it as their new permanent home. They’re currently based in Dundonald Activity Centre – but having to move vaulting horses and other equipment after every session is apparently getting in the way of healthy exercise. With DACattached to Dundonald Primary School and protected from CAT, the Muirhead building is a sitting target for them. But DGC operate classes seven days a week – and a take-over would leave little or no room for other sports and clubs that currently use Muirhead. And it’s this possible exclusion of other sports and interests - by a single self-serving club - that has rightly upset MTRA. But the real villain in this localised skirmish is the Community Asset Transfer policy itself. Our local council is using it as a convenient back door to off load the expense of running village halls and community properties across the whole of South Ayrshire. Interestingly, last week’s Budget - in a nod to the centenary of  – announced extra funding to protect and preserve the many village halls built to help small communities recover from the ravages of the Great War. In stark contrast, South Ayrshire Council wants to wash their hands of them! The Muirhead decision will finally fall to a full SAC meeting. It will be interesting to seethe four elected Troon councillors look their constituents in the eye – or choose to look away in line with council policy. From where I sit, Dundonald Gymnastics Club has  plus members, a waiting list, over  internet followers and employs more coaches than Dodds of Troon. It appears everyone and their auntie wants to see the wean wearing a wee blue leotard and a medal. That’s fine. But surely not at the expense of other children with other interests and needs. If DGC want a place to themselves – let them find it and fund it themselves.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilSchoolsWorld War TroonDundonaldAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13563563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_boyle.jpg","title":"danny boyles armistice tribute pages","story":"NewsDanny Boyles Armistice tribute Pages of the Sea to honour British Armys first black officer on Ayr beachA large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsLieutenant Walter Tull\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first black officer in the British Army will be commemorated on Ayr beach as part of director Danny Boyle’s Armistice commission Pages of the Sea. Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives step up hunt armed","story":"NewsDetectives step up their hunt for armed thugs who attacked and attempted to rob woman in her homeShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPolice are now appealing for information after the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives today have stepped up their hunt for two armed thugs who attacked a terried woman and tried rob her in her Ayr home.

Pages of the Sea is very much a community event and people are invited to come along between .am and amand pay tribute to all those who left our shores during the war. There will also be a change to recite a poem written especially for the event.

The tour will include the chance to see a brand-new carving marking the centenary of both the RAF and Armistice Day and the opportunity to place remembrance poppy crosses or long-stemmed poppiesin the woodland in memory of loved ones and all those lost in battle.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire. The specicationsapproved would only apply to newly licenced vehicles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGlasgowAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS69111168.jpg","title":"tributes paid ayr united legend","story":"NewsTributes paid to Ayr United legend Johnny Graham, who dies aged The Somerset Park legend died last week, aged , and tributes have been led by former teammate Jim McSherry.ShareByMike Wilson:,  NOV NewsJohnny Graham at a packed Somerset Park\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWarm tributes are being paid to Johnny Graham, the skipper who led Ayr United into the first ever Premier League.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

The location has been selected as it forms the primary gateway into the town and is visible from the railway line, said the applicants.Ken Ross, from applicant Hallhill Development Ltd, said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Scottish Government has approved this fantastic piece of public art and are actively engaged with Andy to get the bear erected in Dunbar in spring .ldquoThis piece of art will not only contribute to the emerging identity of Dunbarrsquos new gateway but has the potential to draw people into the area to find out more about John Muir.Mr Ross was confident the sculpture would prove popular with children and would become a landmark.The sculpture is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, heavy at the bottom and lighter towards the top. Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire. He said: ldquoThe proposal has had a range of dferent opinions within the community.ldquoHowever, any piece of new artwork that is ever produced and put into a location always has dferent opinions from dferent people about whether it is good or not.ldquoThe artist selected to produce this is well-known. He did design the Kelpies, which is now an internationally known piece of artwork.Andy Scott has completed over  projects across the UK and internationally.He was delighted it had been approved and said: ldquoIt is fantastic that we have now been given the green light to create this sculpture in memory of such an influential character as John Muir, especially given todayrsquos environmental climate.ldquoHis role in creating national parks is well known in the United States, but sadly not so well known here and this bear sculpture will provide an opportunity to enlighten people about the man and his work.ldquoIt is a symbol of the wilderness John Muir was such a passionate advocate of and is testament to his incredible desire to protect the natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"chef-at-seton-sands-rubbed-his-groin-against-teenage-waitress","story":"Paul Salinger, , of Prestonpans, was working as a chef in the kitchen at the county caravan park, near Port Seton, when he deliberately pressed against two girls who had been employed as waiting staff.One victim, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, told Edinburgh Sherf Court that Salinger ldquobrushed against her with his groin when she was collecting meals from the kitchen area.She also said that Salinger would stare at her while she worked shts at the holiday parkrsquos restaurant.The South African national stood trial at Edinburgh Sherf Court last Thursday, where he denied a total of five charges.The father-of-two took to the witness stand himself, where he told the court he had worked in many busy kitchens during his career and it was inevitable that people would brush against each other.He said he started at Seton Sands in February this year but was let go in May following the allegations.Salinger, of Longdykes Road, said he could not remember any specic incidents but added: ldquoIf I had brushed against her I would have had pots, pans and bowls in my hand.The chef said it was most likely the girl had felt a bowl he was carrying that touched against her rear end.He told the court: ldquoI would never have done that ndash I would never have grabbed her bum.ldquoMy body never touched them.

Irsquove no reason to touch anyone in that way.He said he had never been spoken to by park management about any complaints made against him and he was let go without any explanation.Following all the evidence, Sherf John Cook agreed to the defence motion to acquit Salinger on a charge of sexual assault on a woman which was alleged to have taken place at his previous employment at the Cakes  Shakes outlet in Musselburgh.The sherf also acquitted Salinger of a second alleged offence of making inappropriate comments and sexual gestures towards another woman at the same place.But the sherf told Salinger he was ldquosatisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had sexually touched the two teenagers at Seton Sands and said to think otherwise would be ldquofancul.Sherf Cook added that the offences had been ldquodeliberate sexual assaults and not accidental and that the pots and pans excuse was ldquoinherently unlikely.Sherf Cook deferred full sentence on Salinger for the preparation of social work reports and a restriction of liberty order assessment.The sherf also placed Salinger on the sex offendersrsquo register for a period still to be decided.Salinger was found guilty, following a summary trial, of sexually assaulting a teenager by seizing her by the bottom and squeezing it at Seton Sands Holiday Park on an occasion between March  and May .He was also found guilty of pressing his body against a second girl, placing his hands on her waist, and rubbing his groin against her at the same location and between the same dates."},{"url":null,"title":"celebration-of-the-life-of-inspirational-north-berwick-teenager-held","story":"Reon McSherry, , who had battled leukaemia, sadly passed away last Thursday.His family said: ldquoReon was an inspiration to all who knew him and will be forever missed.Reon, of North Berwick, was diagnosed with leukaemia in April  and required a bone marrow transplant.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

This yearrsquos calendar, which is now on sale, features two excellent shots of his ndash Buachaille Etive Mograver on the cover, and the railway bridge at Loch Awe as the illustration for August.Mr Stokes, , who lives in Dunoon, has been retired for  years. For  years ndash  with his own business ndash he designed and carved gravestones.ldquoWe covered the islands and up north, we had agents all over the place, he said this week. ldquoI took up photography in , because my we was getting fed up looking at me, and it has given me more of an artistic look at le than when I had all the design work I was doing with the gravestones for all these years.He was taken under the wing of Archie Reid, a Dunoon photographer, and a friend of his when they were younger.ldquoEverything is kept simple and basic. Compose your image, donrsquot just go running at it. Walk around. I try to do that so that when I get to the screen, therersquos very little left to do.ldquoMy camera is a Canon D that I bought from Archie. Itrsquos not like the huge cameras you can get nowadays. I use a couple of filters [attached to the front of the lens to enhance the final shot] and my favourite lens is a Sigma mm-mm. Archie put me onto it, and I can do everything with it. I also have a mm-m Canon, which is a great lens but I havenrsquot used it as often as I thought I would.ldquoI always use a tripod and a remote control when Irsquom doing serious pictures ndash I prefer not to hand-hold the camera in that sort of situation, involving long exposures. If yoursquore shooting a waterfall you might need an exposure of three or four seconds, for example.At first, Mr Stokes did wildle photography, ldquobut there is so much time involved in it, he says. ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking, trying to get a bird to land in a specic place or a squirrel to do your bidding. But landscape photography has its own heartache as well. You can run down to a scene where there are perfect reflections in the water but by the time you get down to the loch, it is full of ripples hellip and it drives it nuts, but that is all part of the fun.His shot of Buachaille Etive Mograver was taken from the frozen river at Kingshouse Hotel, in Glencoe. And at Loch Awe his eye was caught by the ldquototal flat calm of the reflection.ldquoThe two shots were bonus pictures, as I call them. Irsquom usually up at four in the morning when I leave Dunoon and Irsquom up north in pitch darkness, waiting for sunrise.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

As the old sheaves of the copper-red bark die, they peel themselves off revealing the young, smooth bark beneath.The changeable colours of the treersquos leaves are equally dazzling. Starting out as orange in the spring, they become a pinkish-brown and then yellow, before finally turning deep green.By late autumn, the leaves have taken on a deep red hue, complementing its peeling, coppery bark.

The former Rangers and Ajax striker is a season and a half in to a new job managing Uzbekistanrsquos once all-powerful football club, Pakhtakor, and things are going well.The Georgian, in new kit, is standing in the centre of his perfectly manicured home pitch and telling a TV crew why the wilderness years for his team are over. ldquoThis year the squad is pleasing everybody, the Georgian says in heavily accented but well rehearsed Russian. ldquoThanks to Alisher Burkhanovich, everything has changed. The management. The trainers. The philosophy.The name-check is for Alisher Burkhanovich Usmanov, an Uzbek-born multi-billionaire once named as Britainrsquos richest man and best known in the UK as a former Arsenal shareholder.Mr Arveladzersquos reference is not accidental. Because Pakhtakorrsquos coach is appearing in a half-hour hagiography about Mr Usmanov on state-controlled rolling news channel Orsquozbekiston .The show , a glowing documentary called a ldquoSense of Belonging, was first broadcast this summer. It leaves viewers in no doubt that Mr Usmanov is the force behind Pakhtakorrsquos revival and even more dramatic plans for a super-modern -million stadium to replace the clubrsquos roofless s Tashkent ground.Pakhtakor manager Shota Arveladze on Ozbekiston But it never - crucially - quite says he owns the club. In fact, Pakhtakorrsquos ultimate formal ownership might be closer to Mr Arveladzersquos old Ibrox home than his new Uzbek one.Pakhtakor was purchased last year by a Uzbek registered ldquoforeign company called SFI Management Group. The company has never publicly named any shareholders or explained why it is listed as ldquoforeign.However, a corporate filing obtained by The Herald shows SFI has just one shareholder: Quality Trade Supplies, registered at a former draperrsquos shop in Douglas, South Lanarkshire.:Investigation: Scotlands firms, Argentinas bribes and Uzbekistans dirty cottonThe firm, QTS, for short, is one of Scotlandrsquos increasingly notorious limited partnerships, a kind of shell company which Transparency International has called ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering and which the CBI has warned harms this countrys global reputation.The shop in DouglasQTS has never filed any accounts or named any ultimate beneficiary. There is no suggestion the firm has done anything wrong, but everything it does is shrouded in corporate secrecy. So much so that its role in SFI has sparked serious concerns among Uzbekistan-watchers over corporate transparency.That is because SFI does not just own Pakhtakor. The business has taken control of huge chunks of state industry in the country on ldquotrust. Under deals made with Uzbekistanrsquos rulers SFI manages the countryrsquos biggest metal-maker, Uzmetkominat and its giant Almalyk copper mine and smelter complex, one of the most polluted places on the planet. SFI has also moved on Uzbekistanrsquos state drugs monopoly and other metals and insurance businesses.In its fawning reporting, Orsquozbekiston  has linked investment at both Uzmetkombinat and Almalyk to Mr Usmanov, but without nailing down the billionairersquos exact role. Its Sense of Belonging documentary signalled a huge change in Uzbekistan. The old regime of Islam Karimov, the Soviet-era strongman who died in , has gone and the countrys new leaders are prepared to share economic power with expat oligarchs such as Mr Usmanov.ldquoAlisher Usmanov is taking an active role in a whole series of important projects for our country, the news channel declared over dramatic drone footage of doves flying across anhistoric Uzbek skyline.The opening of Ozbekiston s documentary on Mr UsmanovOne of those projects Ozbekiston  lauds is the construction of a the Tashkent Metallurginal Plant, which is being carried out, it said, ldquowith the support of Mr Usmanov.\"Scottish\"-owned Tashkent Metallurgical Plant under constructionThis  million euro scheme - now well under way - was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos still relatively new president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, last year, as a major foreign investment. Last month The Herald revealed that investment was carried out by QTS.Tashkent Metallurgical Plant now shares an office with SFI, just across the road from the home ground of Pakhtakorrsquos Tashkent rivals Bunyodkor.A succession of anonymously owned Scottish and other British shell companies have been investing in Uzbekistan, including in the cotton industry and in a prestige downtown office development, Tashkent City.\"I am proud to be an Uzbek.\" Alisher Usmanov on Ozbekiston The Herald wrote to SFI and QTS asking them to name their ultimate beneficiary was. We received no reply.Alisher Ilkhamov, a research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, is very concerned over the lack of transparency.He said: \"The opacity surrounding deals such as the privatisation of Almalyq and the Tashkent City development indicates the emergence of a new type of authoritarian regime in Uzbekistan.\"Speaking more generally, Mr Ilkhamov added: \"If the previous, Karimov regime was based on preserving the Soviet-style command economy, then the Mirziyoyev regime is turning out to be more business-friendly and eager to attract foreign investments.\"However, the new regime like the previous one is failing to adopt sufficient safeguards against corruption and therefore is prone to the collusion between public office holders and the private sector represented mainly by oligarchs.\"This is gradually becoming more akin to what we see in Russia and Kazakhstan, a combination of relatively liberal economic system with grand corruption.\"Ozbekiston  reports SFI taking over management of the giant Almalyk mine and smelterLast month an Uzbek human rights group - eager to find out who was really investing in their country - urged the UK Government to act on SLPs. The UK Government is considering reforms.Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP leading the campaign for change in the House of Commons, said progress had been \"agonisingly slow\". Ministers, she added, should be really concerned about revelations from Uzbekistan.:Questions as Uzbek president grants tax breaks to anonymous Scots firmsResearcher and writer Richard Smith summed up: \"We are witnessing two pantomimes. In Uzbekistan, itrsquos no secret that Mr Usmanov manages huge swathes of the countrys economy via SFI Management Group, which is controlled by QTS. \"Meanwhile, the UK pretends to require disclosure of ultimate beneficiaries. Yet QTS has still not made any statement about its controlling person, more than a year after the law took effect, and remains unsanctioned.\"As the months pass, itrsquos dawning on everyone that, despite the fine words about transparency, the UK isnrsquot the least bit serious about disclosure.Mr Usmanov is a patriot helping to rebuild his country, according to state TV. But is he alone  Another Uzbek expat oligarch, Belgian-based minerals billionaire Patokh Chodiev, or Shodiyev, has also been linked with SFI . His London representative has repeatedly denied this to The Herald.Meanwhile, back at Pakhtakor it is not just the manager who changed after the SFI take-over. The club has a new president, Bobur Kabulovich Shodiyev. Russian media says this is Mr Chodievs nephew.

We know in any criminal trial the test is whether or not the prosecution has proved its case ldquobeyond reasonable doubt. If not, juries have to acquit. Which means not guilty ndash there is no middle way in the law. So why, in effect, have two not guilty verdicts Some lawyers, like Derek Ogg QC, have argued that logically it is the ldquonot guilty verdict that should go. This would concentrate jurorsrsquo minds on deciding whether or not the prosecution case had been ldquoproven beyond reasonable doubt. This is apparently how it was in Scottish courts in the th century. The ldquonot guilty verdict was reintroduced in the th century.However, many lawyers used to argue that the not proven verdict harmed the accused, not the accuser. Having a jury rule that the case against you was ldquonot proven might suggest that you got off on a technicality, or that the prosecution just hadnrsquot got its act together. Defence lawyers argued that guilt should be expunged by an unequivocal declaration of not guilty ndash meaning he or she really, really didnrsquot do it. The late former Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, moved a Commons Bill in  to have the ldquobastard verdict, as Sir Walter Scott called it, scrapped. But this wasnrsquot because he thought it would necessarily make rape convictions easier.Not proven still has its defenders. Some say abolition would undermine Scots law and that we shouldnrsquot be importing an Anglicised system on a wave of emotion. It is good for juries to have more than one option so that they can express a degree of doubt, or qualication. Brian McConnachie QC, the former President of the Criminal Bar Association, has pointed out abolishing it could have unintended consequences. As we discovered during the debate about scrapping corroboration in rape trials, getting rid of one anomaly often creates a raft of new ones.In Scottish jury trials there need only be a simple majority for conviction, eight to seven in a -person jury. In England the test is much stricter ndash there are smaller juries and the majority has to be  out of . If not proven is dispensed with, many would argue that the Scottish majoritarian system would have to go too. This might actually make it harder to get rape convictions.Indeed, you could argue that not proven gives an ldquoeasy option the other way ndash in favour of the accuser. It allows juries who believe the ldquovictim, but are not convinced by the prosecutionrsquos handling of the case, to say: ldquoWe think he or she probably did do it, even though the evidence isnrsquot conclusive. This arguably sends a signal to the civil courts that this person might be guilty on the balance of probabilities. Civil courts are less strict on the need to prove ldquobeyond reasonable doubt.This is actually what happened in the case of Miss M, the rape victim who has been arguing for not proven to be scrapped. She made legal history last month by taking the not proven verdict against former student Stephen Coxen to the Personal Injuries Court in Edinburgh, where it was effectively reversed. She was awarded pound, in damages. Of course, that raises further questions about double jeopardy. If someone is found not guilty in one court, does it makes sense for them to be found guilty in another If you accept the #metoo doctrine ndash ldquoalways believe the victim ndash then you donrsquot really need trials at all. However, this causes problems when the wrong people get accused. When one of the leading figures in the #metoo movement, the Hollywood actress Asia Argento, was accused in August of statutory rape of an underage boy in Calornia, her defenders insisted that she should be given the benefit of ldquodue process, and be innocent until proven guilty. This was correct. The rush to judgment was wrong and unfair ndash even though she reportedly gave the ldquovictim , to settle the claim privately.The problem with sexual assault and rape is that they often involve dficult cases relying, in the absence of corroboration, on ldquohe said she said and the credibility of the parties involved. I have never sat on a rape case jury, but Irsquove spoken to many who have, and they tell me the cases often involve alcohol and vague and muddled memories. It is probably the case that too few rapists are being punished. But tipping the scales in favour of the victims doesnrsquot always work.The justice system in England has been rocked by the collapse of a succession of highly-publicised rape trials in which the police withheld, or failed to disclose, evidence crucial tothe defence. The former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, had to make a formalapology, and then resigned last month, after a review covering just two months of English rape cases found that  had to be halted because the police had failed to hand over evidence of innocence. The police insist that they werenrsquot trying to rig the prosecutions. But the head of the politan Police, Cressida Dick, has since issued new guidance saying that ldquocomplainants in rape and sexual assault cases should be listened to, but not automatically believed. ldquoItrsquos not all about the victims she said.Justice is hard. The debate over not proven has been grinding on for a long time. Holyroodrsquos Justice Committee has said that the dual acquittal is on ldquoborrowed time ndashwhich I suppose is itself a kind of not proven verdict. Scrapping the Scottish verdictis beginning to look well nigh inevitable. But whether or not this will increase rape convictions is, well, not proven."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-christmas-festival-has-113m-boost-for-the-city-report-finds","story":"Underbelly, the major Fringe producers who also manage the Christmas festival and Hogmanay, said last years events - which include an ice rink, a market, a city centre fair and other attractions - drew , visitors.Over the six week run, the Christmas festival grew its audience by .%, which was up from , visitors the previous year, a report by BOP Consulting has found.Underbelly recently released an impact assessment, by the same company, for Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay which showed an economic impact for Edinburgh from the festival in   of poundm.Footfall to Edinburghrsquos Christmas three main sites was counted at .m.The centre of the city is transformed during the festival, with attractions, rides, food markets and a big wheel taking up Princes Street Gardens and St Andrew Square.More than , tickets were bought for Edinburghrsquos Christmas rides, attractions and shows last year.The majority of the attendees were from outside Edinburgh and the Lothian area.Of the % who came from outside the capital, around seven per cent came from  dferent countries including Australia, Ireland, USA, Holland, Spain, Canada, France, Germany and New Zealand.Last year was the fth year of Underbelly produced Edinburghrsquos Christmas for the City of Edinburgh Council.

First based in an old wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House in Edinburgh, it moved in  to an old printing works in the city’s Warriston Road.And after this year’s very special Armistice centenary year, the factory will be on the move again – albeit on a temporary basis.A team of around  ex-servicemen and women who hand-assemble more than five million poppies and , wreaths every year for the Scottish Poppy Appeal will be moving to Redford Barracks for two years to allow for a much-needed refurbishment of the factory.The aim is not to rip out the heart of what is a very special workplace – boasting regimental flags and thank you letters and posters from the thousands of school children who have visited.But some £. million from the Libor Fund – fines imposed on banks for manipulation of Libor levels – will ensure the factory is fit for the st Century.Overseeing the move immediately after this year’s Remembrance Day will be factory manager Charlie Pelling, who has been at the helm since .During a tour of the factory, Charlie explained more about the move.He said: “We’ll be moving on November  with the aim of being operational by the start of January.“The aim is to be back at our factory in time for the  or  appeal.“We have a small window of opportunity to make the move as the factory operates year round.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Band of brothers...Alastair Skene, Gerry Lindsay, Stewart Ballantyne, David Adamson, Arthur Dyke and Danny Renowden who help to make five million Scottish poppies annually. \"  \"  Armistice  Picture Gallery: Meet Scotland’s poppy makersviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Special year...for PoppyScotland with Gordon Michie, its head of fundraising, hoping to raise an additional #, from the  Poppy Pledge campaign. \"  \"  Armistice : PoppyScotland’s  Poppy Pledge campaign viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"“We are like a toy shop in that we work  months of the year with sales throughout that period but our sales climax in the run-up to Remembrance Day in the way a toy shop does at Christmas.“We’ve got to strip out asbestos from the factory, update the heating and wiring, modernise the windows and install a lt to the first floor.“We have to make the factory health and safety compliant and fit for purpose for the st Century.”Charlie is also hopeful that they will be able to create a learning facility.He said: “Thousands of visitors tour the factory every year – from pensioners to pre-schoolers.“Around  school children visit the factory each year, with the same number of adults too.“We want to create an educational facility where they learn about the factory before touring the site.”The workers who power the factory will, however, remain at its beating heart and will be involved in the refurbishment and move.“We have records for more than  servicemen and women who have worked here,” said Charlie. “Since , we’ve had in excess of  workers.“The factory exists to provide employment for ex service personnel who may otherwise struggle to find employment.“They work year round to ensure that enough poppies are created for the Poppy Appeal and for the many wreaths laid at ceremonies across the country.“The move to Redford Barracks will undoubtedly be challenging.“But we’ve got a plan and some very good people here so we’re confident we’ll do it and still be able to create all the poppies for .“The fact we don’t have a modern production line is something we cherish.

And it’s perhaps for this reason when you walk through the Lady Haig Poppy Factory doors in Edinburgh, there’s a sense of leaving your worldly woes behind.There’s also no sense that the  or so former service personnel are standing on ceremony for visitors – the good-natured banter continues as they go about their business.It’s a camaraderie sadly now missing from many workplaces where the bottom line means more than the product.But here the focus is firmly on production with pride in every poppy that leaves the factory floor. feels at home at the factory, where he has worked part time since Decemver .

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pm#Immediate changes# will be made to the Orkney transmission reinforcement project, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networkshave announced.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Executive chairman Wolfhart Hauser had taken over at the helm following O’Toole’s departure, but will now revert back to his non-executive chairman’s role.Details of the changes came as the group reported interim pre-tax losses widening to £. million in the six months to  September from £.m a year earlier due to restructuring and reorganisation costs from the withdrawal of Greyhound services in Western Canada.But revenues rose . per cent to £. billion and on an underlying and constant currency basis, pre-tax profits jumped . per cent to £m, while earnings lted . per cent to £.m.But FirstGroup warned that its rail arm, which includes the South Western Railwayand Great Western Railway franchises, would see annual underlying operating profits fall year-on-year.

The school was forced to close after numerous safety incident in just a few weeks.Other incidents include a pupil being struck by a metal  from a roof in West Lothian, and a ceiling collapse in East Ayrshire.The figures were obtained by a Freedom of Information request from  of Scotland’s  councils, submitted by the Scottish Conservatives. The exact figure is likely tohigher as many councils fail to collect and publish the information.Liz Smith, Scottish Conservative shadow education secretary, renewed her call for building reports to be included in school inspections.“Each one of these incidents represents a risky situation that children or staff have been put in while at school.“Children and staff must be safe at school, and the fabric of the school buildings must be maintained properly.“Including building reports in school inspections is an obvious way to ensure that school buildings are fit for purpose and prevent any more avoidable accidents.”A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland , said the incidents were a “wake-up call”.“Safety incidents in schools are a stark warning to all local authorities and those responsible for the construction and maintenance of our schools – that they must take action to ensure that all buildings are well-designed, properly-built and maintained to an extremely high standard.This is not an area where corners or costs should ever be cut.” A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The health and safety of pupilsis of paramount importance. All local authorities have a statutory responsibility to manage and maintain the school estate and provide a safe environment for young people and staff.“In the current year, councils will receive a local government finance settlement of £. billion.

He’s about to get on a plane but the worn white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard, on which he wrote best selling hits with his band Chic and produced some of the biggest-selling albums of all time with David Bowie, Madonna and Diana Ross, won’t be shoved in the hold. The Hitmaker, as he calls it, and which is integral to his funky ‘chucking’ style, won’t be out of his sight. He left it on a train once, luckily got it back, but yes, he did freak out...The Grammy Award-winning musician, composer, arranger, guitarist and co-founder of Chic says, “I have a replica, and a plexiglass one and they sound really great live and on record, real close, but it’s not the same.” Rodgers is about to fly out of Toronto when we speak, heading for London in his trademark dreadlocks and beret to put the funk into the X Factor, replacing the touring Robbie Williams as a judge. He’s also collecting a humanitarian award from the Global Gt charity for his work with his We Are Family Foundation, named for his Sister Sledge anthem. Career-wise he’s flying high too, after releasing the first Chic album for more than two decades this summer featuring Elton John, Emeli Sandé and Lady Gaga, with another album due out in February and about to kick off a -date European and UK tour with the band that’ll make Glasgow Dance, Dance, Dance in December. He’s the newly elected Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and as the recently-appointed inaugural Chief Creative Advisor for Abbey Road Studios, it’s time to celebrate Good Times. Rodgers is responsible for decades of floorfillers, after starting out as a musician on Sesame Street, playing clubs and bars before co-founding Chic in  with bassist Bernard Edwards. There were Chic disco hits: Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love, Le Freak and Good Times, and hits he produced for others: He’s The Greatest Dancer, We Are Family, , I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, , Like A Virgin, , Let’s Dance . Then there are his collaborations, with Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories album and single Get Lucky, global hits that won him three Grammys, with Avicii, Sigala Disclosure and Sam Smith, plus the genre crossing talent that saw Good Times spark the advent of hip-hop when it was picked up as the base for Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. In all, his work has sold more than  million albums and  million singles, but it’s been  years since Nile Rodgers and Chic released a studio album. Hence the title It’s About Time. “Yes,” he laughs. “For one thing there’s the obvious – it was about time I did this stuff and got it back out.” It would have been earlier, but as Rodgers was working on the album the deaths of his friends and previous collaborators Prince, David Bowie, George Michael and Chris Cornell hit him hard. “What happened was I had got a large tape drop from Warner Brothers of masters that I thought were gone for ever and that made me feel so happy and nostalgic and I was about to release an album. But then people started passing away that I had written tribute songs about, and it made me feel like I’d be capitalising on Bowie and Prince’s passing, and it was just so wrong.”The time is right now, however, and at , Rodgers has been thinking about mortality. He’s beaten prostate cancer once in  and last year had a lump removed from his kidney. Today he declares himself fit and healthy,a little tired from last night’s Toronto gig, but he’s determined to fulfil his mission to get everyone dancing to feelgood music.“I know that our time on this planet is finite,” he says “and you know what, I want to spend the rest of my le making really great dance music. When I was producing Eric Clapton one day he came out of the studio and said to me that he was gonna play blues for the rest of his le. I said ‘Eric, you mean to tell meI come see a Clapton show I’m not gonna hear Sunshine of Your Love  Or any of those Cream and Blind Faith cool songs ’ And he said ‘no, you’re not gonna get that again, because I’m not going to play it again.’ I went home and thought about it for a bit and I said, ‘well, hell,Eric Clapton is gonna play blues for the rest of his le, I’m gonna play dance music for the rest of my le. Right! I just wanna play music for ever.“Not that I think I’m Eric Clapton, but you know,you’ve put in all this time, you have the right to decide what you want to do and I decided that I like to make music that makes people happy, makes people want to dance. It really feels good to me to see people express themselves through motion.”Speaking of dancing, as a legendary exponent of dance music, what does Rodgers consider to be his hottest move  How would he wow one night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco  Rumba and Tango, Latin Hustle, too, Yowsah, Yowsah… “I have no idea,” he says and laughs. “I don’t consider myself a good dancer any more, because I was actually a serious dancer. I was actually a ballet dancer in another le. Not many people know that, but it’s true. Around the time I was working with Sesame Street when I was  or , and I took it very seriously for a while. Then I just started gigging a lot more and I didn’t have time to practise and ballet you gotta practise just as seriously as you practise music.” As for the upcoming tour, Chic fans can expect to hear the old favourites alongside some of the new album because Rodgers knows his crowd and after playing the festival circuit with Glastonbury and Coachella last year, he’s also conscious a lot of the audience will be hearing them for the first time. “At our shows I ask people to raise their handsthey’re seeing Chic for the first time, and we’re averaging about  per cent first timers. This is amazing to me! Especially since we’ve played the UK so much. I’m like Jesus, everybody has seen us! But no, more than half the crowd will raise their hands and that’s cool.”Rodgers may have four decades in the business but he’s still an innovator and already at Abbey Road has been the first to shoot a video there and has more plans to move and shake the legendary studio.“Abbey Road’s amazing,” he says. “They’re allowing me to do everything there, matter of fact, ha! I might re-invigorate my ballet career, have a dance recital there! It’s just incredible. It’s probably one of the most artistic, creative environments I’ve ever been in. I’m making films, doing concerts, even Paul McCartney wound up having a concert there after I came.”Born in New York in  Rodgers didn’t have the easiest start in le. His mother was  when she got pregnant with him and his biological father, Nile Rodgers Senior, a travelling percussionist, moved on. With his mother and step-father both being heroin addicts, Rodgers learned young to be self-reliant. The last time I interviewed him he spoke about how once as a five-year-old he got wedged down the back of the sofa when his parents were out of it and he had to wait for his grandmother to come round to the house and retrieve him. If he could, what would he say to that little boy stuck amid soft furnishings, waiting for someone to realise he was missing  “I’d say, buckle up, it’s going to be a hell of a ride!” He laughs. After learning to play the guitar at  Rodgers figured he could pay rent and landed his first professional job in the Sesame Street band at . But despite their struggles, he’s very close to his family, especially his mother, and is grateful for the legacy of music bequeathed him by his parents. It’s in his bones and has been all his le.“I have music in me, around me, it just swirls in my head all the time. I can’t turn it off as a matter of fact. Oh yeah, I always hear music, all day long. I heard it as a child, and I hear it now,” he says. In was almost inevitable he would make his name in music, from the beginning playing and practising every day. “I wish I could do that now,” he says, “I would give my left arm to be able to do that. Oh, no… you know what I mean.” He laughs. “I just think practising makes me play better, and he quotes the violinist Jascha Heetz, who once said ‘ I don’t practise one day, I know it two days, the critics know it three days, the public knows it.’ His insecure formative years necessitated a work ethic that spurred Rodgers on and brought financial rewards such as the house by the shore in Westport, Connecticut, with the boat moored at the jetty, where he lives today. Apparently alone, but then Rodgers never talks about his relationships. “Yeah, I’m pretty discreet,” he says. And just out of nosiness, because he’s ulged this to me before, and he is the child of a pair of beatnik hippies, does he still like to hang out there naked when he doesn’t have guests  He laughs. “Yeah, of course, why would I change  Old dog new tricks  No.” With his colourful le story, Nile Rodgers The Musical, should be worth the wait, but his much anticipated autobiographical show is still being written and may be another couple of years in the pipeline. Right now he’s got his hands full with the musical he wrote with Jean-Paul Gaultier, entitled Fashion Freak Show, currently wowing the Folies Bergeres in Paris, as well as another musical bound for Las Vegas and provisionally London’s West End. “The Paris show is doing great and the other one is loosely based on disco lestyle stuff and it’s being done by [Steven Hoggett] the choreographer from the Harry Potter show that’s in the West End now.”As to who would play Rodgers in the musical of his le, he’s at a complete loss, sounding surprised at the question.“Oh, I don’t know… I wouldn’t even… I don’t even know,” he says. “That person would have to be a hell of a lot more talented than myself, because they’d have to do a lot of things at an early age that I couldn’t do when I was that age!” He laughs.Compose, perform, produce, act, oh and they’d have to add ballet to the long list of talents now too, know their ballottéfrom their boogie. “Yes, they would.” He laughs. And no, he wouldn’t consider playing himself.Today Rodgers’ mother Beverly has Alzheimer’s, but the two find common love in music and when he visited her last week, as usual they revisited their playlist for le.“She loves everything. My mom is a be-bop junkie... and loves everything from Charlie Mingus to Nina Simone to Miles to The Beatles. The other day we were singing Hey Jude and she knows every single word, even sings the ad libs…” He lts his voice and does his mother doing McCartney’s scat, “Ju-Judy Judy Judy Judy Judy.“She’s amazing.”Rodgers’ own playlist of signicant songs would contain primarily jazz and some of his own tracks, not out of narcissism, but because he rarely gets to hear them. “I only hear my music when I’m playing it and there’s a huge dference between the recorded and performance versions. In performance there’s a lot of improvisation whereas recorded is exactly the same every time. Sometime when I hear the recorded version I go ‘oh my god, I forgot I wrote that part too’. The other day I heard Let’s Dance and forgot how intricate the horn voicings were. I listened to the whole album and thought wow, this is cool.“Let’s Dance was part of Rodgers’ reinvention as a producer, the album that turned his career around after punk kicked in and left disco apparently for dead. Boogie was busted as punk gobbed in its face and Chic, with their soul, RB, funk, glitter and groove were out in the cold. “Durin’ the disco sucks era,” he says, “we couldn’t get anything, no buzz, no one would listen to us. We were just persona non grata. It’s not that the music was bad, it was just we were not flavour of the month. People didn’t like us.”The collaboration with Bowie was to reinvigorate his career and satisfy his love for discovering new sounds. “Up until David’s record I had six failures in a row. I was known for producing disco. But after David I probably had six successes in a row: David Bowie, INXS, Duran Duran, Madonna, then Duran Duran again, then Mick Jagger and David Bowie with Dancing in the Street... yeah I had a clutch.“And collaborating is fun! Not only have you got your own energy to vibe off, but you have other people’s. I love being in Chic but for the last  years I’ve been mainly in the room with brand new people, in other people’s bands.” Looking back over his career Rodgers is hard pushed to nominate an event or song of which he is most proud. “I’m not more proud of Let’s Dance than We Are Family, Get Lucky, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance or Rapper’s Delight.”As he lists the titles, it prompts a muscle memory, the beginnings of a hustle in the hips, a shimmy in the shoulders, so perhaps it’s the longevity of his sound that’s most impressive. Rodgers, however, can’t explain his success. “If I knew the answer to that question, don’t you think every record I’ve put out would be a hit ” he says. “Most of my records are not hits. Most of my records are flops. Only a handful are hits. Well, actually, a big handful....”A very big handful...“Well, yeah, anyway...” he trails off, modest and mellow.Holding his Hitmaker, it’s time for Rodgers to board his flight, with a final word about how much he’s looking forward to the tour. “You know, I really love composing, I love making records, and when we know from the charts that people are listening, there is a joy that we get. “But when you can actually see people having a good time, that feels pretty damn good. There’s nothing like that. It’s wonderful. So... see you in Glasgow for Good Times.” @JanetChristieNile Rodgers  Chic kick off their UK arena tour at The SSE Hydro Glasgow on  December.

Publication ceased in June, .The event will showcase the research being done at the university’s College of Arts on the important role Scotland had in the development of the genre of comics.Laurence Grove, professor of French and text image studies at the university, said: “We want the Night at the Museum to be fun and would encourage lots of dressing up to celebrate our comic book superheroes.“From earliest times from Egyptian hieroglyphs to medieval illuminated manuscripts we have used pictures to explain the world around us, so the culture of comics has always been here, but there is an important story for everyone to know as well – that Scotland was the cradle of comics.”Historians have hailed Glasgow Looking Glass as an early example of satirical topical graphic journalism, a genre that became increasingly popular throughout the th century.Prof Grove said: “This is a night of fun and enjoyment with a few interesting insights to celebrate all things comics. The fact is comics are, quite frankly, super-cool and I love researching this inspirational field to bring it to new audiences.”The event will also be a chance for children and adults to explore the cultural and historical background of comics from the earliest times up to the present day.Highlights of the night will include an appearance by Scotland’s Frank Quitely, one of the world’s top comic book artists with the legendary DC Comics.Frank Quitely is the pen name of Glaswegian Vincent Deighan, who said: “I can’t wait for the Comics Night at the Museum. This will be a one-of-a-kind experience. Don’t miss it!” The event is been run to coincide with St Andrew’s Fair Saturday. The organisers say it “aims to positively respond to consumerism of Black Friday” by delivering a festival of arts and culture and also support the wider celebration of St Andrew’s Day. People are being encouraged to dress up as their favourite comic book characters for a special costume parade to celebrate the Comics Night at the Museum extravaganza.Director of The Hunterian Steph Scholten said: “The Hunterian is delighted to support this exciting Comic Night at the Museum. It will contribute to the global Fair Saturday movement and the celebration of St Andrew’s day to boost social inclusion, fairness and sharing inspired by Scotland’s National Day.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4829343.1542183412!/image/image.jpg","title":"independent scotland wouldn t get special treatment from eu eva oer","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Some believe an independent Scotland would be able rejoin the EU in just two years, but Eva Oer has her doubts.Voting Remain might be one of the best things Scotland has ever done for its international reputation. At least that’s what it looks like from this European mainlander’s perspective.Scotland is regarded as a rebellious but likeable underdog who’s being dragged out of the European Union against its will. Bagpipes, haggis and whisky are all fine – but honestly, for the politically interested traveller, Scotland’s EU-friendly attitude is the icing on the cake.Brexit felt like a rejection for many of my fellow Europeans – so it feels good to know there are still people out there who think dferently. Yes, euroscepticism is on the rise in many countries – just look at Italy and its government’s anti-EU rhetoric, blaming Brussels for everything that’s going wrong, even for the Genoa bridge collapse. But there’s still a widespread acceptance of the EU in Europe. In fact, a recent survey commissioned by the European Parliament showed that  per cent of respondents believed that their countries’ membership of the EU was a good thing. That’s the highest it has been in  years.So for many people, Scotland seems like a bastion of reason in a world gone crazy with populism. The Scottish position on Brexit has evoked solidarity and sympathy. But the question is: does this attitude mean that an independent Scotland would be welcomed by the EU While the political landscape has signicantly changed since the independence referendum in , most people would see one country in particular as a roadblock. Spain is still having its own domestic problems with the separatist movement in Catalonia, a region in the north-east of the country. So that’s one member state that wouldn’t particularly be in favour of any independence referendum.Their government has recently changed, however. In June, socialist Pedro Sánchez took over as prime minister after his predecessor Pedro Rajoy was ousted in a vote of no confidence. Sánchez has been reaching out to the independence supporters in Catalonia, but he’s far from being in favour of the region parting ways with Spain and will not support a referendum. His party PSOE backed the hard stance of Rajoy’s government after the Catalan vote back in October  and helped impose direct rule on Catalonia under article  of the constitution.: EU negotiator: ‘Simple fact’ independent Scotland could join EUBut Scotland has one advantage over Catalonia: Holyrood and Westminster negotiated the Edinburgh Agreement, thereby allowing for the Scottish Government to organise a referendum. In contrast, Spain’s constitutional courts declared that Barcelona’s referendum was illegal. The situation is dferent, and that’s why some observers think that, provided another independence referendum was done constitutionally, Spain would now not stand in the way of EU membership from an independent Scotland. But hypothetically – just how long would it take an independent Scotland to rejoin  I asked David Martin, Scotland’s longest-serving member of the European Parliament. The Labour MEP had an astonishing answer: “If we were independent, I think we could be a member of the EU within two years.“ That seems like a remarkably short time. But again, Scotland has an advantage: its laws already comply with EU law which puts it well ahead of other EU candidates like Montenegro. Martin has a direct comparison as he is chair of the delegation to the EU-Montenegro Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee.“We would have to negotiate things like fishing – which would not be easy but would not be impossible,“ he said. “We have to decide what we’re going to do about the single currency and about Schengen, but I think the areas for negotiation would be rather narrow.“: Guy Verhofstadt: Scotland ‘obliged to follow’ Brexit decisionOther MEPs have spoken in a similar vein: the German MEP Elmar Brok, for example, has reportedly said Scotland’s readmission into the EU could be “speedy“. An independent Scotland might only have a few “narrow” issues to discuss compared with all the points the EU would have to discuss with other membership candidates. But these subjects seem so sensitive and complicated and they could, in my opinion, turn out to be much harder to solve than some might hope for. Scotland right now benefits from the special position the United Kingdom has within the EU. If the country did become independent and tried to get back into the EU, it would have a better starting position than others, but it would not automatically be able to claim the UK’s opt-outs. Why would the EU allow a cherry-picking member once again – that didn’t work out so well with the UK, did it  Scotland would enter the negotiations like a completely new applicant.As you can imagine, from my German perspective, a closer membership than before would not a bad thing I have experienced the benefits of my country’s EU membership. But do all those who support independence know that an EU membership for a future Scottish state might entail giving up the opt-outs and adopting the euro In my mind, independence supporters in Scotland often make it seem asgetting back into the EU would be a really smooth operation. But let’s be honest: while Holyrood might gain control from Westminsterthere was independence, they would have to cede some of it to Brusselsthey wanted to join the EU again.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4829190.1542124527!/image/image.jpg","title":"spice girls kylie and elton where are new bands amid nostalgia fest","story":"Given Scotland is awash with the music of the past # in the form of ageing stars and tribute acts # Brian Ferguson questions whether young bands will be able to compete.It is hard to believe that Kylie Minogue was to blame for one of my most underwhelming music festival experiences.

Perth Concert Hall’s forthcoming line-up has an Elvis impersonator, a “Magic of Motown” night, an Eagles tribute act, and a visit from The Osmonds and UB. Among the acts being served up at the Caird Hall in Dundee are nights devoted to the likes of The Bee Gees, The Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Falkirk Town Hall’s programme has tributes to Bon Jovi and Whitney Houston, alongside Abba, Blues Brothers and Buddy Holly tributes.To be fair to all of the above, Scotland’s biggest venues are serving up a similar menu. Culture Club, Belinda Carlisle, James, Ocean Colour Scene, Franki Valli  The Four Seasons, The Australian Pink Floyd Show, Madness, Chic and Paul McCartney are all booked into the Hydro in Glasgow before Christmas. Tributes to George Michael, Abba, Arentha Franklin and even The Spice Girls are jostling for attention in the Edinburgh Playhouse’s spring programme.A few years ago, the nostalgia circuit was largely the likes of The Rolling Stones, Sir Rod Stewart and Elton John.

Senior ministers were summoned to Downing Street for inidual meetings with Mrs May tonight in a bid to shore up support.The text is understood to include contentious elements of the ‘backstop’ plan to maintain the status quo along the Irish border after Brexit, including separate regulatory checks for goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.It sets out a proposal for the UK to remain under EU customs union rules until a trade deal between London and Brussels can guarantee the free flow of goods across the Irish border, but an ‘exit mechanism’ from the customs backstop is not expected to include a firm end date or give the UK the right to walk away unilaterally.Brexiteers and DUP MPs seized on leaked details of the draft agreement, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, calling on cabinet to reject the draft as “a failure of the government’s negotiating position and a failure to deliver on Brexit”.Boris Johnson dismissed the breakthrough as “vassal state stuff” and claimed it “failed to protect our precious Union”.“For the first time since partition, Dublin will have more say over aspects of government in Northern Ireland than London,” the former foreign secretary added. “Am I going to vote against it  Yes.”Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson suggested Northern Ireland was being “hived off”, and the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: “If the reports are as we are hearing, then we couldn’t possibly vote for that.”Cabinet will meet at pm tomorrow afternoon, at the same time as ambassadors from the  other EU member states gather in Brussels for a briefing on the draft text from chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.If ministers give their approval, the draft deal could be published as early tomorrow afternoon, with the Prime Minister unveiling the agreement with a Downing Street statement, UK government sources suggested.However, several cabinet ministers including the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab are understood to be unhappy with aspects of the Irish border backstop, and the risk that the UK could be prevented from signing its own trade dealsit is held within the EU customs union indefinitely.Scottish Secretary David Mundell is expected to view the draft agreement tonight. Welcoming the progress, he said it was “encouraging there’s a potential agreement”.“We need to reflect on that detail and see what’s there and hopefully be in a position to take forward a deal,” he told journalists.Mr Mundell and the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson have previously signalled their refusal to accept new trade barriers in the Irish Sea.In a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May last month, both senior Tories highlighted that “having fought just four years ago to keep our country together, the integrity of our United Kingdom remains the single most important issue for us in these negotiations.”They said: “Any deal that delivers a dferentiated settlement for Northern Ireland beyond the dferences that already exist... would undermine the integrity of our UK internal market and this United Kingdom.“We could not support any deal that creates a border of any kind in the Irish Sea and undermines the Union.”As well as the UK’s orce treaty, the draft texts includes an outline declaration of objectives for the future trade and security partnership between London and Brussels, which could include details of EU demands for access to British fishing waters - another contentious issue for Scottish Conservative MPs.Responding to news of the potential breakthrough on social media, Nicola Sturgeon said: “If the PM’s ‘deal’ satisfies no-one and can’t command a majority, we mustn’t fall for her spin that the UK crashing out of EU without a deal is then inevitable – instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table.”“Also, though the Withdrawal proposals will get most attention initially, the declaration on future relationship is just as important.“If that is vague and dodges tough issues, a blindfold Brexit would beckon. It would be deeply irresponsible for parliament to sanction that.”As news of the draft agreement broke, ministers from devolved administrations were in London for their latest meeting with UK counterparts on post-Brexit power-sharing.Their meeting in the Cabinet Office, where a reading room was set up tonight for ministers to review the draft deal, broke up half an hour early.Scottish Government’s Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell issued a call for devolved administrations to be shown the text, but UK government sources said it couldn’t be shared before the Cabinet had seen it.“It is completely unacceptable that devolved administrations have still not seen the detail of any draft deal,” Mr Russell said following the meeting. “We know no more coming out of tonight’s JMC than we did going in.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4829320.1542183764!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish ministers not being shown draft brexit deal branded unacceptable","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s Brexit Secretary Mike Russell has hit out at the UK Government after a provisional deal on the UK#s exit from the European Union was agreed with Brussels.Mr Russell insisted it was “completely unacceptable” that Holyrood ministers and the other devolved administrations had not been given details of the draft document.He spoke out after a Number  spokesman confirmed this would be discussed at a crunch meeting of Theresa May’s cabinet on Wednesday.“Cabinet ministers have been invited to read documentation ahead of that meeting,” the spokesman added.But Mr Russell hit out: “It is completely unacceptable that devolved administrations have still not seen the detail of any draft deal.”He had spent the day in London for a Joint Ministerial Committee meeting chaired by Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, and involving the other devolved adminsitrations of the UK.Read more: Mike Russell demands ‘immediate repeal’ of part of UK Brexit legistlationBut Mr Russell said he knew no more coming out of the meeting than he had when he arrived.“We must be able to scrutinise the deal and understand its implications,” the Scottish Constitution Relations Secretary said.He was also clear that “reaching agreement at technical level does not negate the threat posed by Brexit to jobs and living standards” adding the “best way to avoid that is to stay in the EU, in line with how people in Scotland voted”.And he reiterated the Scottish Government’s stance thatit was not possible, the only option Holyood ministers would accept was one keeping the UK in both the European single market and customs union.Ms Sturgeon saidthe PM is unable to get her Brexit deal through the House of Commons, campaigners aiming to keep the UK in the single market should then “take the opportunity to get better options back on the table”.The First Minister tweeted: “If the PM’s ‘deal’ satisfies no-one and can’t command a majority, we mustn’t fall for her spin that the UK crashing out of EU without a deal is then inevitable - instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table.”She also warnedthe deal was “vague and dodges tough issues” on the UK’s future relationship with the EU then “a blindfold Brexit would beckon” - with Ms Sturgeon insisting it would “be deeply irresponsible for parliament to sanction that”.Read more: Cabinet summoned after Brexit negotiators agree draft text©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

I am leaving a small gt to the charities I care for in my will.Will to Give member the USPCA added its appreciation of the value of legacy gts with Brendan Mullan, Chief Executive, explaining:ldquoThe USPCA was established in  and since then the activities of the USPCA have evolved to meet the ever-changing needs of animals.By deciding to leave us a gt in your will you are helping us protect all animals across Northern Ireland.Legacies are extremely important to the USPCA and without these the charity would not be able to deliver our vital services to animals. We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The investment by The Lotus Group, one of Northern Ireland’s best established property solutions companies includes the relocation of the company’s headquarters to the listed building which formerly housed the Down Shoes factory. The iconic art deco building has been carefully refurbished to create a central and fully al new base for The Lotus Group’s management team and support staff, and offers additional space for further commercial and residential development. The flagship site on Banbridge’s Newry Road is also home to the heritage inspired Lotus Village - a private housing development by the company. Work has now commenced on the second phase of the project which includes a range of high end semi-detached homes, townhouses and apartments.The regeneration programme and HQ move signals a new developmental phase in the strategic direction of The Lotus Group, resulting in a re-focus on key business sectors and the provision of added value services.This includes the private nursing home sector, where, based on years of expertise, The Lotus Group has moved away from the standard ‘landlord-tenant’ model to the provision of a quality-driven ‘managed asset’. This is reflected in its selection of Countrywide Care Homes as a strategic partner for its nine nursing homes operating throughout the UK. By successfully managing the transition of the nursing homes from the failed Southern Cross Group to Countrywide, The Lotus Group has secured a total of  beds, underpinned  jobs, and delivered a signicantly enhanced quality of service to residents. This includes three nursing homes in Northern Ireland.According to Chief Executive Brian Henning, adopting a longer term view to service delivery sets The Lotus Group apart from others in the sector: “The past few years have proven that those who understand the property market in its entirety and are prepared to take a long-term, strategic view, are best positioned to manage the market in the future. Despite the recent economic upheaval we believe there remain many opportunities which demand creative and strategic property solutions.This is essential to support the recovery and growth of the NI economy as it moves out of recession.“Throughout the last  years we’ve continued to invest in the best people, consolidated our strengths in key market sectors, created partnerships which add value, and utilised our expertise to deliver a strengthened and stable property portfolio which meets the needs of the changing economy.Looking to the future, Mr Henning added: “We’ve honed our business offering and have a highly experienced, professional team in place. Through prudent management we’re ideally positioned to deliver robust, professional and service-led solutions of which our new partnership with Countrywide Care Homes is an excellent example.” Adding his support, David Simpson, MP for Upper Bann said: “This investment by the Lotus Group is a good news story for the local property sector and represents a positive economic development for the area as a whole. It proves that even through an economic downturn, strategic planning, entrepreneurial spirit and strong leadership can deliver long term results.”  with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, who provided Helen with expert advice and help with developing a business plan in order to help turn her business idea into a reality\"   with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, who provided Helen with expert advice and help with developing a business plan in order to help turn her business idea into a reality\"  Local mum hails Go For It programme after she achieves le goal of opening her own business Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East.

Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

This is the fork in the road. Do we pursue a future as an independent nation or accept EU domination, imprisonment in the customs union and nd class status. Cabinet and all Conservative MPs should stand up, be counted and say no to this capitulation.— David DavisNovember , “Cabinet and all Conservative MPs should stand up, be counted and say no to this capitulation,” he said.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson urged his ex-Cabinet colleagues to “chuck it out”, warning on the BBC that the proposals made a “nonsense of Brexit”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the influential European Research Group of dozens of Tory MPs, said: “It is a failure of the Government’s negotiating position, it is a failure to deliver on Brexit and it is potentially iding up the United Kingdom.”“There comes a point at which the policy and the inidual become so intimately connected that it would be very hard to carry on supporting the person who is promoting this policy”- Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group@Jacob_Rees_Mogg | #newsnight pic quLuYQOJkJ— BBC NewsnightNovember , On the BBC’s Newsnight, he said he had not called for a no confidence vote in Mrs May “but there comes a point at which the policy and the inidual become so intimately connected that it will be very hard to carry on supporting this policy”.Askedhe would be writing a letter to the Tory backbench  Committee about Mrs May’s position, he said: “Not in the next  hours.”Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith suggested Mrs May’s administration could collapse over the deal.“If the Cabinet agrees it, the party certainly won’t,” he said, and when askedthe Government’s days were numbered, added: “If this is the case almost certainly, yes.”Jo Johnson, brother of Boris and a Remain-supporter who quit as transport minister over the Government’s approach, suggested that Cabinet ministers were questioning whether they could support the deal.Askedthere could be further resignations, he told a rally in support of a second referendum: “I talk to many MPs, colleagues in the Cabinet and where … I know how much they all think deeply about these issues and they are all looking deep into their consciences and thinking whether they can support this deal.”If the PM’s ‘deal’ satisfies no-one and can’t command a majority, we mustn’t fall for her spin that the UK crashing out of EU without a deal is then inevitable - instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table.— Nicola SturgeonNovember , The special meeting on Wednesday could potentially be a flashpoint for tensions between Brexiteers and Remainers around the Cabinet table, with speculation that Leave-supporting ministers including Penny Mordaunt, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom could be prepared to quita deal ties the UK too closely to Brussels.But sources close to Brexiteer ministers played down the prospect of walkouts, with Mrs Leadsom said to have enjoyed a “good discussion” with the Prime Minister.Chief Whip Julian Smith told reporters: “I am confident that we will get this through Parliament and that we can deliver on what the Prime Minister committed to on delivering Brexit.”But the challenge of getting a deal through Parliament appears even more dficult for Mrs May than winning the support of her Cabinet.pic alsjjxqmm— Arlene FosterNovember , The  DUP MPs, upon whom Mrs May relies for a majority, appear set to reject a dealit crosses their red lines.DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “I am heartened by friends of the Union on both sides of the House and across the UK who have pledged to stand with the DUP in opposing a deal which weakens the Union and hands control to Brussels rather than Parliament.”She added that “these are momentous days and the decisions being taken will have long-lasting ramications” and pointedly stated that “every inidual vote will count” in the Commons.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must not fall for Downing Street “spin” that rejecting the deal means crashing out of the EU and “instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table”.The deal follows intense negotiation in Brussels, with measures to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland the main stumbling block.Irish broadcaster RTE reported that the deal involved one overall “backstop” in the form of a UK-wide customs arrangement – as sought by Mrs May – but with deeper provisions for Northern Ireland on customs and regulations. reported that an independent arbitration committee will judge when a UK-wide customs backstop could be terminated.There will also be a review in July  six months before the end of the transition period, at which it will be determined how to proceed – a new trade deal, the backstop or an extension to the transition period.The Dailyrevealed that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told Cabinet that Northern Ireland will be in a “dferent regulatory regime” under the customs backstop and subject to EU law and institutions, something that may “cross a line” for the DUP.Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy - and that guarantees standards and protections. If this deal doesn’t meet our six tests and work for the whole country, then we will vote against it. #BrexitDeal— Jeremy CorbynNovember , Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party would vote against the dealit failed to meet its tests.“From what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country,” he said.But his own approach to Brexit will come under attack from former prime minister Tony Blair on Wednesday.In a speech in London Mr Blair will lash out at the “abject refusal of the Labour leadership to lead the country out of the Brexit nightmare”."},{"url":null,"title":"footage from reconditioning camp shows andy murray on road to full recovery","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

New York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta’s allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with the rape of another woman.In a new allegation, the suit says that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. It alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman.About a year after the alleged incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show Boardwalk Empire, and the lawsuit says she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in The New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing.Weinstein’s lawyer Ben Brafman in response to the suit pointed out the lack of charges in New York, and said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta’s “newly minted version of events including her new Calornia claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination”.Representatives for Scorsese, who is not a defendant in the case, had no immediate comment.De la Huerta, , alleges Weinstein damaged her career by at least  million dollars.Ashley Judd, who is among numerous women suing Weinstein, says in her own lawsuit that Weinstein hurt her career and prevented her from getting at least one role. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ashley Judd Judd cites an interview last year with director Peter Jackson, who said that Weinstein warned him against hiring Judd and Mira Sorvino for his Lord Of The Rings films. Both women have alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed them.De la Huerta’s lawsuit alleges Weinstein first pressured her for sex in her apartment after the two had been at a party celebrating the premiere of the film Blue Valentine in , and threatened to harm her careershe did not submit, then raped her when she refused.The lawsuit says that Weinstein taunted her with phone calls for two weeks, and on December  she agreed to see him at her apartment with the intention of demanding that he stop the calls. She drank large amounts of alcohol in her anxiety, making her vulnerable, and Weinstein raped her again, according to the suit.Three weeks later in January , the two were both in Los Angeles for a series of awards-season events when de la Huerta again tried to confront Weinstein, the suit says. Her lawsuit alleges the mogul opened the door of his room at the Four Seasons Hotel and exposed himself to her and invited her to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman who was in the room and undressed.De la Huerta left feeling “embarrassed, scared, shocked and humiliated”, according to the lawsuit.She then drank excessively and was denied entry to a GQ party at the Chateau Marmont, it adds. Photographers captured video of the drunken actress, further damaging her reputation and career, the lawsuit says.More than  women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex, with his lawyer challenging the credibility of his accusers."},{"url":null,"title":"russian opposition leader navalny allowed to leave russia","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time.

I initially lobbied for more investment in the park and am glad local council officials took this on board and are developing a masterplan with public input at its heart.Cllr Andrews said he was pleased to take part in last weekrsquos consultation and was impressed at how many people took the time to attend, confirming he will be supporting the motion and views outdoor leisure as an economic driver for the whole region.ldquoThe people who attended last weekrsquos event agree that the country park is a major tourism asset and offers signicant development potential which must be appropriate and not spoil what is already in place, he continued.ldquoDelamont can act as a major economic driver and benefit not just the immediate killyleagh area, but the wider district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rogue trader tried to swindle £7k from Newcastle pensioner  ","story":"A FRAUDSTER tried to scam an  year-old Newcastle woman out of nearly pound, for tarmacing her driveway which he had deliberately damaged, Downpatrick Court has heard.Dean James Winderstood shamefaced in the court on Thursday on five charges relating to work he carried out in February.Winder, who traded as Unique Style Driveways, admitted one charge of fraud by misrepresentation and three further charges of aggressive, misleading, and unfair commercial practice.He was also admitted using an inaccurate service flyer which failed to say that his business was registered in England.All offences took place between February -.The court heard that the scam may never have been uncovered had it not have been for the actions of a taxi driver.Police praised the driver who raised the alarm with the Trading Standards Service after he learnt of what was happening as he brought the woman to a bank to withdraw pound,.Trading Standards called the police who arrested Winder and another person at the scene.Winder was given  hours of community service and fined pound by District Judge Amanda Brady for his actions, which were later condemned by police as ldquodisgusting.He was also instructed to immediately pay back pound, which he had taken from the woman as a deposit.A prosecution lawyer said that Winder approached the woman and her partner unsolicitedly to power wash and seal a paved area at their Mourneview Road home for pound.However, after doing the work, Winder pointed out some problems with the driveway and offered to do further work for pound,, which was increased to pound, to tarmac the full driveway.Some of the problems that Winder had pointed out in the driveway were those he had actually created while doing the first job, the prosecutor added.A defence lawyer acknowledged that Winder, now with an address at Holmes Avenue, Dreghorn in Irvine, Scotland, had seen an opportunity to get further work from the elderly couple and had done a ldquopoor job of tarmacing the driveway.However, he said Winder had made a full admission for his actions, offered his apologies and had turned up in court with the full amount of money to be ed to the elderly householder.The lawyer added that while there was another man involved in the work and transaction, Winder was ing the money on his own.Judge Brady described Winderrsquos actions as ldquomean-spirited. She told him: ldquoYou took advantage of an elderly person, quite deliberately, and deliberately damaged her driveway to get more money.Winderrsquos conviction was later welcomed by the police.Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: ldquoThis was a callous and calculated act by Winder who deliberately set out to scam this couple out of their hard-earned money.ldquoWhat Winder did was disgusting and I hope the courtrsquos judgement will bring some level of comfort and reassurance to the couple.ldquoI would also like to praise the taxi driver who raised the alarm and thank our colleagues in Trading Standards Service.Chief Superintendent Walls also appealed to friends and family of older or vulnerable people to talk to them about lsquocold callersrsquo and make sure they know what to do when salespeople come to their door.He added: ldquoNot all cold callers are rogue traders, but some are. If you feel that something isnrsquot quite right, it usually isnrsquot.ldquoUnofficial traders can overcharge unsuspecting and often older householders for poor quality work, or work that is never completed at all.ldquoRemember, itrsquos your home and itrsquos OK not to open the dooryou have any concerns.

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

He knew myself and my friends and was a really friendly man.\"He always used to know what ice lollies we would each have, see us crossing over and put them on the counter ready.\"Mr Pontis suffered a stroke after falling in his garden in spring , and later had three small heart attacks and three bouts of pneumonia.He pulled through each time, but caught pneumonia for a fourth time and died on Friday September .His funeral was held at St Peterrsquos Church in Cardf on Tuesday October , before he was buried at Thornhill Cemetery.Ms Sakke called the service was ldquolovely.ldquoThe priest who led the service had lived in Rome and so did some of it in Italian, she added. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

Mrs Prancersquos husband, Clive, died at  from kidney cancer at the Marie Curie Cardf and Vale Hospice in August , and Mrs Prance said the support she and her husband received was invaluable.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/albion_1.jpg","title":"new apartment building for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew  A new £m apartment building could be built in Belfast city centre amid early development plans, Ulster Business can reveal. The Albion scheme could see the redevelopment of an area off Great Victoria Street, currently a car park, turned into a “multiple unit residential development for rental or sale”. The area is located at Wellwood Street, and bounded by Glenalpin and Norwood Street. Those behind the scheme, which could be worth around £m, say around  construction jobs would be created at the peak of the build. A pre-application event is due to take place at the nearby Holiday Inn on November . Ciaran Deazley, project architect from Like Architects said: \"The Albion development seeks to provide a landmark building for inner city living.
