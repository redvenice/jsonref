The moves led to suggestions that Ms Rayner had actually emerged with more power rather than less. Addressing the row she said: \u0027There is a small group that get the headlines that are just in a power struggle.  \u0027And that\u0027s nonsense - because we\u0027re not in power in Westminster.

Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Video: Twitter@edwinpootsmlaEdwin Poots: One challenge he will face over the next year which Arlene Foster did not is working alongside another politician as first minister. Photograph: Paul FaithUnless a deterioration in relations between the Stormont parties leads to an early collapse of the Executive, the new DUP leader has 50 weeks and five days to prepare his party for the next Assembly election.Much of the drama since the putsch against Arlene Foster took place behind closed doors, with the DUP instructing their candidates to campaign in private, but the battle to show that Edwin Poots is listening to unionist concerns must be fought in public.A platform to staunch the party’s self-inflicted Brexit-related wounds must be found, especially over the Northern Ireland protocol – which has led to trade checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and led many British suppliers to stop supplying NI customers.Although access to the EU single market may have proved beneficial to some exporters, all shades of unionism have concluded the protocol represents a clear and present danger to Northern Ireland’s constitutional status.Modifications are coming, promises Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, but softening the protocol (or “sandpapering off the barnacles” to quote Boris Johnson) is unlikely to satisfy those demanding its complete replacement.Unionist leaders have backed a legal challenge to the protocol, arguing it breaks the UK’s Act of Union and infringes on the Belfast Agreement. However, the new DUP leader cannot just hope for a court victory. More militant politics is needed, the DUP believes.Demanding a complete boycott of North-South co-operation, Traditional Unionist leader Jim Allister says the DUP has flip-flopped up to now, attending some North-South meetings, but staying away from others.“If, as has patently been the case,” argues Allister “the east-west relationship has been trashed, why is there any continuation of North-South, which merely gives encouragement to the belief that unionists will just suck it all up, going on as if things never happened?”Alliance MP Stephen Farry says such a boycott is “another dead-end” and “a foolish strategy” but all the indications – as exemplified by the late briefing by the Donaldson camp to the BBC’s Stephen Nolan on Wednesday night – are that this is a path the DUP is likely to follow.Former DUP Ards and North Down councillor Tom Smith, who quit the DUP two years ago, voted against Brexit, though he strongly opposes the protocol, but he now mocks his former colleagues’ protests as “waffle . . . as weak and watery as diarrhoea”.“There’s going to be a lot of unhappy people,” he says, adding that ordinary unionists “have been sold a pup, the grassroots were led to believe if we get rid of Arlene then things will change, but from what I can see it’s going to be business as usual.Irish language Act“That’s going to trickle down to the grassroots, the members and councillors. They are going to be in the same boat in a couple of months’ time as they were with Arlene and that’s going to cause trouble,” he goes on.The pledge made that the Assembly will pass an Irish language Act causes consternation in the DUP, too, and the next likely leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Doug Beattie, has made clear that he will not offer cover to the DUP.Such a move, included in the January 2020 New Decade New Approach deal, would lead to the increased “Balkanisation” of Northern Ireland’s neighbourhoods, where language, not just flags would mark boundaries, Beattie argues.The unease about the Act is one of the primary reasons why Foster was removed, believes Jim Allister, but he is not convinced that her replacement will veto it, since neither Donaldson or Poots said much about it in the manifestoes circulated to the DUP electoral college.Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine progress this side of next May’s election, which will lead to accusations of bad faith by Sinn Féin. However, moderate unionist MLA Claire Sugden says the DUP’s hardening line is no surprise.“This behaviour was always going to happen one year before an election because that’s what our parties do, they harden their positions to reassure their voters they are who they say they are,” she says. What happens after next May will be more interesting that what happens before.One of the letters from DUP councillors which hastened Foster’s demise called on the DUP to return to its Christian values, demanding the repeal of abortion reforms ushered through by Westminster.It was Foster’s failure to vote against a ban on gay conversion therapy which finally triggered her removal. Sugden is not surprised by the return to old Paisleyite values, describing Christian pro-life groups as “the biggest lobby” she has dealt with in seven years.Tom Smith, who was deselected as a DUP candidate after backing a motion to light up Ards Town Hall in rainbow colours to mark LGBT awareness week, warns that the party will lose middle-ground support if it continues on this line.“There are very many people within the DUP who, like myself, have absolutely no issue with LGBT rights. They joined the DUP because they wanted a strong party to speak up for the union. If the DUP does retreat into a more fundamentalist form, it is going to alienate quite a lot of people,” he says.Party’s grassrootsOne challenge Poots will face over the next year which Foster did not is working alongside another politician as first minister. On the positive side, it offers time to spend with the party’s grassroots, and space to distance himself from photo images with Sinn Féin.The downside could be that – like the outgoing Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, who appointed Robin Swann as Stormont minister for health just before the pandemic struck – Poots might be overshadowed by a high-profile first minister.Now, the DUP will “play up” the prospect of a Sinn Féin first minister to prevent support leaching away, since Stormont’s single biggest party appoints the first minister, but that tune may be losing its power.“I think it’s wearing a bit thin,” says Smith, “The Bobby Storey funeral saga punctured that a bit because it showed the DUP is very reliant on Sinn Féin and if Sinn Féin misbehaves in any way what action can the DUP take?This is the DUP’s worst fear, but a former party strategist paints a more positive picture. If Poots steadies the ship and things do not reach “a tipping point”, the subsequent Stormont maths could be favourable.In the Assembly elections four years ago, the DUP were battered because unionist voters punished them over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, while nationalists were energised by Foster’s description of Sinn Féin’s push for an Irish language Act as “feeding a crocodile”.Starting from such a low base, the strategist surmises, the party could have a bad day, but yet still come back with just one less seat, though the battle over the protocol will give Poots an “incredibly hard” time ahead.However, if the DUP leadership can “turbo-charge” their campaign against the sea border without “promising things which are demonstrably undeliverable” they might navigate a way out of the party’s current doldrums, he says.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"edwin poots profile new dup leader is a traditionalist and paisleyite","story":"Edwin Poots has defeated his constituency colleague Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, by 19 votes to 17, to succeed Arlene Foster as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. Video: Twitter@edwinpootsmla Edwin Poots is a strong opponent of the Northern Ireland protocol. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireEdwin Poots was, quite literally, raised in the DUP.After his election as leader on Friday, he reminded reporters that his father had been one of the party’s founder members he joined the DUP as a teenager following the killing of the Ulster Unionist MP Robert Bradford in 1981.He is also steeped in its religious elements, and is on the traditionalist, Paisleyite wing of the party. He is opposed to the decriminalisation of abortion in the North and has courted controversy over his views on homosexuality and evolution – he is a creationist who believes the Earth was created about 4,000 years ago.As minister for health he tried to maintain a ban on gay men giving blood which had been lifted elsewhere in the UK, a ban later found by the high court to be “irrational”, and also opposed same-sex couples being allowed to adopt children.CoupGiven his family connections, it was unsurprising, then, that Poots has long harboured a desire to lead the party, and was one of those rumoured to be moving against Arlene Foster long before she was deposed in last month’s coup.In the video message announcing his candidacy on social media, the minister for agriculture said he was a “proud Northern Ireland man. I love this people and this place, and it faces many challenging times”.Certainly he comes with plenty of experience a DUP member throughout his political career, he has been an MLA for Lagan Valley since 1998 and held several ministerial portfolios, including culture, health and, currently, agriculture.He is also a strong opponent of the Northern Ireland protocol and the Irish Sea border, and tried to prevent the construction of infrastructure for carrying out physical post-Brexit checks at the North’s ports in his capacity as minister.His traditionalist credentials could play well among those who opposed the softer line taken by Foster, though the Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister has posited that his facilitation of the port checks could undermine this.Yet as his eventual acceptance of the legal requirement to facilitate the checks demonstrates, he is also a pragmatist as minister for health he reached a cross-Border agreement on children’s heart surgery which led to sick children from the North being treated in Dublin, and he has proven himself capable of working with Sinn Féin – something which will be required.He began his political career as a member of Lisburn city council. In 1998, he elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly after the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"the cork fishmonger who met the queen i think there was a sense we crossed a bridge","story":" Pat O’Connell meets Queen Elizabeth at his fish counter in the English Market in 2011: “There comes a time when you have to say ‘It’s time to move on’.”Looking back on his moments with Queen Elizabeth in the English Market, Cork fishmonger Pat O’Connell says the reception she received marked Ireland’s growing maturity and its willingness to view Britain in a new light.“We are influenced by history and we won’t forget history but there comes a time when you have to say ‘It’s time to move on’. And at the end of the day, we have more in common with Britain than what separates us,” he says.The encounter between the two was perhaps the apogee of her visit a decade ago this week, where she broke into a smile of genuine warmth as O’Connell quipped about calling an ugly monkfish, “the mother-in-law fish”.Deteriorating linksBut that was then and this is now. O’Connell is an astute observer of politics and is in no doubt that Anglo-Irish relations have deteriorated since, spurred by Brexit and everything that has happened since.He puts the blame at British prime minister Boris Johnson’s door: “In many ways, I think Boris is a mini-Trump. He doesn’t speak the truth and he is more interested in himself than his country and he’s sold a pup in a lot of ways.“He said it wouldn’t hurt Britain to be out of Europe but I think it’s created huge difficulties for Britain. And there will be more to come because I think the devil is in the detail of that deal and we are only seeing the start of it.”However, he finds grounds for optimism in the British visitors that used to call to his stall in the English Market prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, and will do so again once it lifts.“We’ve always had a lot of British people coming in but, after the queen’s visit, they were a bit more relaxed about it. Again, like ourselves, I think there was a sense with them we had crossed a bridge and that can only be a good thing.” How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Matt DunhamPA WireIrish and British officials will seek to work together on topics including legacy issues in the North, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said last night, after a summit meeting with the British prime minister Boris Johnson that sought to reset the Dublin-London relationship after an extended period of turbulence. Both sides said the meeting was constructive and Mr Martin told reporters at Government Buildings last night that the two leaders had agreed to meet again “before the summer recess”, but there was little sign that differences over legacy issues or the Northern Ireland protocol had been bridged.Sources said that the meeting was a success in improving relations and agreeing future co-operation, but fundamental differences remain on major issues.Mr Martin said that they had discussed the Stormont House agreement – which laid down processes to deal with legacy issues and victims from which the British government has signalled its intention to depart – and but agreed only that the two governments would “continue to exchange perspectives on it”.Mr Martin stressed that there had to be “an inclusive process around all issues to do with Stormont House”. The process had to include all parties in Northern Ireland and the victims, he added, and said that “this wasn’t an issue that lent itself to unilateralism in any form”.He also stressed “the need to follow through on agreements that have already been made”.Mr Martin said the two men had “a good discussion on the Ballymurphy situation”, after relatives of the victims roundly criticised Mr Johnson’s response to the coroner’s verdicts this week.“I think he does understand it,” Mr Martin said and indicated that further contributions from the prime minister on the subject were possible. “I think it’s something that he will deal with in his way and in his own time,” he said.A statement from Downing Street said that the two leaders had “reflected on the coroner’s report into the Ballymurphy massacre published this week. They agreed it was profoundly sad that the families of victims had to wait so long for the truth.”“The prime minister restated the UK government’s commitment to finding a way forward in Northern Ireland that delivers for victims, aids truth recovery and helps communities in the future,” Downing Street said.Northern Ireland protocolOn the Northern Ireland protocol, Mr Martin reiterated that the protocol was a matter for discussion between the European Union and the UK, and said that he had spoken to the EU commissioner responsible for its operation, Maros Sefcovic, before today’s meeting with Mr Johnson. The meeting at Chequers was also attended by the British government’s EU negotiator, Lord David Frost, indicating that EU affairs were an important part of the agenda from the British point of view.Mr Martin did not respond directly when asked if the British had asked for Irish support in talks with the EU on the protocol, but he said that the processes in the EU-UK treaty should be utilised to overcome any difficulties. He said he believed the EU wanted to be constructive."},{"url":null,"title":"china completes historic mars spacecraft landing","story":"An illustration of China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft and Zhurong rover on the surface of Mars. Image: Xinhua News Agency via Getty ImagesAn uncrewed Chinese spacecraft successfully landed on the surface of Mars on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua reported, making China the second space-faring nation after the United States to land on the red planet.The Tianwen-1 spacecraft landed on a site on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia, “leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time,” Xinhua said.Chinese president Xi Jinping issued a message of congratulations to all the people involved in the mission.“You were brave enough for the challenge, pursued excellence and placed our country in the advanced ranks of planetary exploration,” he said. “Your outstanding achievement will forever be etched in the memories of the motherland and the people.”The craft left its parked orbit at about 6pm on Friday, Irish time. The landing module separated from the orbiter three hours later and entered the Martian atmosphere, the official China Space News said.It said the landing process consisted of “nine minutes of terror” as the module decelerates and then slowly descends.The official landing time was 18 minutes past midnight, Irish time, Xinhua said, citing the China National Space Administration. The rover took more than 17 minutes to unfold its solar panels and antenna and send signals to ground controllers more than 320 million kilometres away.The rover, named Zhurong, will now survey the landing site before departing from its platform to conduct inspections. Named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, Zhurong has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera.It will study the planet’s surface soil and atmosphere. Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any sub-surface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar.First independent missionTianwen-1 or “Questions to Heaven”, after a Chinese poem written two millennia ago, is China’s first independent mission to Mars. A probe co-launched with Russia in 2011 failed to leave the Earth’s orbit.The five-tonne spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year, launched by the powerful Long March 5 rocket.After more than six months in transit, Tianwen-1 reached the red planet in February where it had been in orbit since.If Zhurong is successfully deployed, China would be the first country to orbit, land and release a rover in its maiden mission to Mars.Tianwen-1 was one of three that reached Mars in February, with US rover Perseverance successfully touching down on February 18th in a huge depression called Jezero Crater, more than 2,000km away from Utopia Planitia.Hope – the third spacecraft that arrived at Mars in February this year – is not designed to make a landing. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is currently orbiting above Mars gathering data on its weather and atmosphere.The first successful landing ever was made by Nasa’s Viking 1 in July 1976 and then by Viking 2 in September that year. A Mars probe launched by the former Soviet Union landed in December 1971, but communication was lost seconds after landing.China is pursuing an ambitious space programme. It is testing reusable spacecraft and is also planning to establish manned lunar research station.In a commentary published on Saturday, Xinhua said China was “not looking to compete for leadership in space” but was committed to “unveiling the secrets of the universe and contributing to humanity’s peaceful use of space.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view uk election can things get better for labour","story":"Are the UK\u0027s Labour Party facing an existential crisis?

If you want the aid, if you want a tarpaulin, then your child needs to be made available, if you want a job then you are expected to sleep with the person who’s able to give you that job.”The MP said she had heard evidence from the Democratic Republic of Congo that “it was so normal that women were expected to have sex for jobs” that translators were “negotiating the deal” between them and UN officials.She said charities needed to follow the example of the Catholic Church in facing up to and addressing years of abuse within their organisations.The Sexual Exploitation of Women and Children by Aid Workers conference was told the abuse had been known about for more than two decades.But despite focus on the sector in the wake of the Oxfam sexual abuse scandal,  new research by King’s College has found that under-reporting and “cover-up by officials” have contributed to the fact that its true extent is not known.Jessica Toale, who carried out the literature review, found data from the UN since 2017 “shows that allegations against UN staff, related personnel and implementing partners is consistently higher than those against the military and police contingents of peacekeeping missions”.Research from Liberia estimated that, at the height of the humanitarian crisis, around 58,000 women had engaged in transactional sex with UN workers, she said.Around 60 per cent of the perpetrators have been identified as local staff or contractors, the study found.Ms Toale said: “Sexual exploitation is more prevalent than sexual abuse, and this most often takes the form of exchanging food for sex for food and basic items including sanitary pads, tarpaulins for shelter or employment  opportunities.”But she warned that there was no consistency to the data or obligation on NGOs to publish reports of abuse.Asmita Naik, a former UN worker turned consultant, said the “reason we know so little” is that “there is a vested interest in not looking into this amongst the very type of groups that would normally be profiling human rights issues”.Her concern that there was a “moral assumption” that peacekeepers are “doing good” was backed by Ms Champion, who said there was not enough safeguarding as it is assumed that those on the ground are “doing it for all the right reasons”.Ms Champion called on the Government to do more to ensure transparency and protect whistleblowers because many of the NGOs are funded with taxpayers’ money and “we have an absolute duty to make sure that it is spent in the most appropriate way”.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has already made any transactional sex by itsworkers a gross misconduct issue, but is under pressure to ensure the same rules apply to all organisations that receive Government money.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality

measurements should be decolonised over links to the British Empire.The mile, inch, yard, pound and ounce are “tied deeply to the idea of the Empire” and their presence in the curriculum could change, decolonising plans by Oxford’s maths, physics and life sciences faculty suggest. Undergraduates have been recruited (on living wage) to conduct extensive research this summer, alongside scholars, into how Oxford’s science curricula can be made less “Eurocentric”. They will draw up proposals for lecturers to implement any recommendations in syllabuses, in a drive to “ersify” maths and science courses.The plans, seen by The , advocate a cultural shift in teaching so that Oxford students\u0027 learning is broadened so they understand the “global historical and social context to scientific research”, and assess “historical work revising older narratives of scientific progress”.It acts on a pledge by Oxford’s vice-chancellor to embed teaching on colonialism into courses following last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, and is among a raft of decolonising overhauls currently underway on campuses across Britain.It comes despite Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, in February warning the “so-called decolonisation of the curriculum” mirrored the Soviet Union and was “censoring history”.The Government also announced in this week\u0027s Queen\u0027s Speech that universities will face fines for silencing students and academics, under new free speech legislation to combat “rising intolerance” on campus.One new curriculum addition to be considered in Oxford’s eight-week decolonising project, is “history of modern measurement, which is tied deeply to the idea of the ‘Empire’ and Imperial standardisation”.Another, for maths courses, is “ancient Chinese number theory – particularly the Chinese Remainder Theorem”.In biology, “economic plant collecting in colonial Brazil (1500-1800)” could be investigated for addition to the curriculum this autumn.Imperial units of length, weight and volume could be given historical context in Oxford\u0027s physics curriculum, which currently includes modules on classical mechanics, condensed matter and fluids.The system of units were officially introduced in the 1824 British Weights and Measures Act, and by 1826 were widely adopted across the British Empire and Commonwealth.However, Imperial units have a longer history, born out of the so-called English Units, a combination of Anglo-Saxon and Roman systems of measurement which included variations of feet, inches and yards.Since the colonial period many countries shifted to metric units of measurement, such as metres and kilograms, but some African and South Asian nations still use limited forms of imperial units, including gallons for volume.Following pressure from students angered by George Floyd’s death in the US last summer, Oxford’s vice-chancellor, Prof Louise Richardson, committed to a “ersity fund” for teaching resources to shake up curriculums, saying it was “an area that is frequently overlooked”.Protests saw Oriel College launch an inquiry into a statue of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes on its facade, and Prof Richardson vowed to ramp up decolonising efforts. “Many departments in social sciences have begun work on making their curriculum more inclusive and adding erse voices to it,” she said.“This includes steps such as integrating race and gender questions into topics, embedding teaching on colonialism and empire into courses, changing reading lists to ensure substantial representation of a erse range of voices, and ensuring better coverage of issues concerning the global South in syllabuses.”The campus “decolonising” drive, often focused on the humanities, is increasingly sweeping the sciences.Two faculties at Sheffield University have named Sir Isaac Newton, the founder of modern physics, and Charles Darwin as figures who may need historical context when their theories are taught because of apparent ties to the Empire.An Oxford spokesman said: “The university supports the ersifying STEM curriculum project, which is looking at how curricula might change to acknowledge questions of ersity and colonialism.We value the input of students into this work all recommendations arising from the project will be referred to departments to consider next steps. More from NewsMore from The Back to

Critics are now calling for sweeping changes to Britainaposs electoral system, amid fears voters are being ignored over and over again. Taking the results of just county, unitary and metropolitan councils which held full elections, the Tories took % of the overall vote, but this was enough to win % of the total number of seats up for grabs. In one area, Staffordshire, the party secured more than eight out ten seats, despite claiming % of votes.Across England, Wales and Scotland, Boris Johnson ’s party won , seats - and a clear majority of over % of the seats in  out of  councils.Meanwhile, Labour took a % share of the vote, and  seats - % of the total number of seats contested.The Lib Dems secured % of the votes and won  seats, while the Green Party won just  seats, despite winning a % vote share. Another % of voters cast their ballot for an independent candidate, or one of the fringe parties, such as Reform or UKIP. These candidates picked up a combined total of  seats - % of the total number up for election.  However, campaigners have long been making the case for Britain’s “First Past the Post”voting system to be scrapped, in favour of a proportional voting system . Under PR, the number of seats each party wins would match the share of votes received. That would still have meant a clear victory for the Conservative Party. But instead of holding , seats, the Tories would have won , -  fewer than the party picked up on election night.That would give the Tories a clear majority of % of the seats in six councils, rather than , and % of the seats on Worcestershire County Council, with one seat still currently vacant.  Under PR, Labour would have picked up an additional  seats, taking the party to a total of , and numbers of Lib Dem councillors would be swelled by , giving the party to  seats. But the Green Party has the most to gain. Under PR, the party would have won  seats - that adds up to  more Green councillors than were actually elected.However, many of the independent candidates who stood on a local  would not have secured enough votes to gain a seat. Evenall votes cast for independent and fringe party candidates were lumped together under one banner, they would have won  fewer seats. The Electoral Reform Society has relaunched a petition calling for England’s voting system to be changed. It says that under the current voting system, ballots not cast for the winning candidates in each ward go to waste. It believes PR would be a much fairer system and would allow more people’s voices to be heard. Dr Jess Garland, director of policy and research at the Electoral Reform Society, said: “Behind these figures are thousands of voters being ignored - often election after election. “These one-party-takes-all outcomes are a deadweight on our democracy, with voters feeling silenced or taken for granted. When a party can get near % representation on a fraction of the vote, something is clearly wrong. “People will look at these outcomes and think – how can this be fair  It isn’t, and it’s time for change. “The broken, winner-takes-all voting system used for England’s councils creates local one-party states that too often seem immune from challenge.  “Voters deserve fair, proportional representation, something that’s impossible under First Past the Post.” Proportional representation means any voting system where the number of seats a party secures matches its share of the vote. However, there are a number of dferent PR systems which can be used. While FPTP decided the outcome of all council votes across England, elections to the Welsh Senedd, Scottish Parliament and London Assembly all used a proportional voting system known as the Additional Member System . With this system, voters have two ballot papers. On the first, voters are asked to use a cross to mark the candidate they want to be their constituency representative. The second ballot is a list of political parties standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies.  However, Home Secretary Priti Patel has already unveiled plans to switch all future mayoral elections in England to a FPTP system. Ministers are pressing ahead with changes after Labour won  out of  mayoral posts contested across England. Meanwhile, the constituency vote retains the First Past the Post system to elect constituency MPs, but the regional vote uses proportional representation to elect additional, regional MPs. It’s aim is to provide a proportional parliament, but also keep a single local representative. However, the Electoral Reform Society sees the “Single Transferable Vote” system as the “gold standard”. Under this system - which is used for local elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland - each elector marks their ballot against their most preferred candidate, but then also marks back up choices. If their first preference is eliminated , their ballot is transferred to a back-up selection, rather than being discarded.The Electoral Reform Society petition, calling for changes to the voting system, can be found here.

But the Government needs to explain why India was put on the travel red list two weeks after Pakistan and Bangladesh were – despite being the source of the iant. We are now paying the price for the failure to protect our borders. It’s anti-social What will it take for social media companies to accept their social responsibility  The tech firms have failed to tackle racism, bullying and discrimination online. Now we learn they are allowing people with eating disorders to be bombarded with adverts for diet supplements and weight-loss apps.  The companies claim they remove the advertisements as soon as they are notied. This is the same poor excuse they use when it comes to abusive or racist content. What they refuse to admit is their algorithms are specically designed to maximise profits without regard for social consequences. Given their revenue, they could easily afford to do more to police their s to prevent people being exploited, trolled or abused. They refuse to do so because they care more about money than morals.

Chemo and radiotherapy can really damage your chances of becoming a natural birth parent. I remember, my younger brother Sean needing to go to St Mary’s in Manchester when he was just  to ‘supply’ some of his sperm. The fact that he didn’t drive yet and our mum and dad had to take him absolutely broke my heart in two. I hated that he was so bloody young and the fact that mum and dad knew what he was going to be doing in that room, it felt so utterly s***. Poor Sean. I’ve spoken with ladies who have been left infertile, or without a womb or oies to create a little human. It’s just so unfair - and the treatment is barbaric in some ways.  Before Ivy, I had miscarried with my first ever pregnancy at  weeks.  weeks probably sounds early to some people, but I had literally known from week  and was delirious with excitement. Trying to contain myself when it came to telling people and buying things and eyeing up new prams. But then one day at work, sitting at my desk I felt it My teeny tiny human was gone already. It’s awful to go through this and yet so many of us do without ever really talking about it. When we fell pregnant again months later, the joy I’d had the first time round was definitely still there, but it was tinged with a big dark cloud of fear, in case it happened again. Thankfully, Ivy was born perfectly healthy in spite of my cancer diagnosis just two weeks earlier. Because we had to move pretty quickly to have my mastectomy and bring Ivy’s birth on early, we weren’t given an option to freeze any of my eggs - plus we wouldn’t have qualied for financial help as we already now had a child.  To be honest, another baby wasn’t important to me in the slightest at that moment in time, all I wanted was to live so that I could love the baby I already had. Plus, my labour had been horric and I remember telling Michael “I’m glad I can’t have any more because I am never going through that again!!” Before long though, I had that yearning for another baby. I missed Ivy’s kicks in my tum and the peachy fuzz of a newborn babe. Trying again for another baby was scary but I’ll save that conversation for another day. Ultimately though, we decided we were too scared to get pregnant again as my breast cancer had been fuelled by my pregnancy hormones. I couldn’t bear to go through nine months of fear and then potentially my cancer ing so we decided to do something we had always talked about - adopt!  After a pretty long process, we were finally approved in November . In January  whilst waiting to be matched with a little boy, my cancer came back and this time, I was told it was no longer curable. Obviously, I refused to accept that and after a second opinion, more treatment, surgeries, diet changes etc, I somehow got to ‘no evidence of disease’ and although I still have an incurable diagnosis, we’re hoping that by staying on lelong chemo, the bugger won’t come back! So we were given the flippin’ go ahead to adopt!!! We were finally matched with a baby boy who was literally our light at the end of the most terrying tunnel. Something we had been told was no longer possible WAS possible - I still pinch myself now! Some of the things I’d really like to try and get across to anyone reading this is the language used around adopted adoptive families. I spoke with Adoption UK recently and some of the terminology used around adopted families is just not okay. Here’s a few we’ve encountered: At least you didn’t have to go through labour!Some women would do anything to experience a natural birth, myself included. It’s hard not to make light of it sometimes, i know. But instead, you could simply congratulate them as you would any other new parents.Send him back!This is unreal. Can you imagine year child hearing this and feeling a sense of not belonging or feeling as though he doesn’t belong. If you feel the need to say something about their behaviour, just go with whatever you would say to a child who isn’t adopted - easy!My sister’s a weirdo, I think she must be adopted!So many of us are guilty of using this phrase and it’s clearly not meant as an insult - but think about how an adopted child overhearing this might feel  “Am I a weirdo  Am I strange  Is that why I was put up for adoption ” There are so many scenarios they could have going on in their little heads, so just try to keep it at “my sister’s a weirdo.”His birth parents didn’t deserve him anywayWe have heard this so many times - it doesn’t make us mad, we just hate the idea of Bill feeling somehow ashamed of where he came from. When strangers are passing judgement on the people that brought him into the world, it can bring a sense of stigma with it. We never want him to feel like his birth parents were bad people - and that he’s ‘lucky’ to have us. We’re bloody lucky to have him!Can we see some photos of his birth parents.Nope! They’re very private to us. We know how easy it is to judge a book by its cover. People might try to see similarities in his birth parents or think they look a certain way and therefore - they judge! This is something we never want Bill to experience, so the photos are for our eyes only, thank you very much.There are so many reasons children are taken into care but what we learned in our training was that almost every single parent doesn’t want to give their child up.And that is heartbreaking, no matter what the circumstances are. For a parent to have a child taken from them is horric. We obviously have to look at the bigger picture and remind ourselves that it was in the best interests of the child. Just because a birth parent can’t look after a child, doesn’t always make them bad people. They could be too young, or have learning dficulties which prevent them from taking good care of their baby. They could be a product of their environment addicted to drugs or alcohol, violent, homeless. So please try not to wonder too much about the background of our children, because all you need to know is, he’s our child and we love each other.

Doctors warned Jes Dean, , that she could have been left blindshe hadnapost sought medical attention after reacting to a home kit. She said she was left with aposcrusty caterpillarsapos and a swollen face oozing liquid after skipping the test. The mum is now encouraging others to always follow the order to carry out one so they are not at risk. Jes, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: Four days after I did my eyebrows I woke up and all my head, eyelids and eyebrows were swollen - I felt absolutely awful.  The following day my eyebrows were weeping a lot, it felt tight on my head and I felt really, really run down. It was horrendous looking at myself in the mirror. It just didnapost look like me, it was like my face was deformed. My eyebrows are matted around the scabs and theyaposre sticking out in dferent directions. The crusty matted caterpillar look wasnapost one I was going for. I can feel the scabs want to come off but theyaposre pulling all my eyebrow hairs out with it. Iaposm trying my hardest not to touch it and Iaposm using pure aloe jelly on it. I think Iaposm going to be left with hardly any eyebrows at all after this.  The beautician said she thought would be fine to use a tiny amount of Eylure Dybrow permanent tint for brows without a test. Jes, who is mum to Jaiden Dean, , Marlee Dean, nine, and three-year-old Logan Dean, said: Iaposm really allergic to hair dye. When I was younger my friend dyed my hair and my face swelled up and it burnt all my scalp, it was horric so Iaposve always kind of stayed away. But then I just thought aposoh itaposs only a little tiny bit of tintapos I didnapost even leave it on for the recommended amount of time it was literally two minutes. I cleaned the area and then put on literally the tiniest little bit onto my eyebrows and two minutes later I wiped it off and that was it. It came up in little tiny bumps and was a tiny little bit itchy but nothing major.  For some reason, I just thought Iaposd be fine but I wasnapost, it was completely irresponsible and stupid. Days later, thataposs when it got really, really bad. After using the tint on April , Jes said she woke up with a grossly swollen face on May - leaving her requiring urgent medical help. After speaking to , she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance over concern that her symptoms were worsening. There she was assessed and prescribed steroids, antibiotics and antihistamines and sent home to heal. Now she has watched in horror as her matted eyebrows clump together with the aposthick and crustyapos scabs and drop off - leaving her concerned they may not grow back.  Eylure said they always state on their packaging that a patch test must be carried out - hours prior to any form of dye application, evenaposyou are a regular user and have previously patch testedapos.Describing the ordeal, Jes said: I didnapost get out of bed for three days, I slept on and off in the dark away from any bright lights or noise.I just felt awful, I was drained of energy and I couldnapost really open my eyes and concentrate on anything.On Wednesday I rang the doctors as I wasnapost getting any better. My eyebrows started feeling hot and tight, they were weeping a lot and I just felt really, really run down.I had no energy and I felt really weird, not myself. My heart rate and temperature was raised and the worry was that any infection might leak into my eyes.They were weeping yellow and white liquid and I had thick scabs. It was crusty all around my eyebrows, it was awful.The surgery referred me to  and they said because it didnapost happen straight away and it was getting worse after such a long time that they needed to send an ambulance out that took me to AE.There they gave me antibiotics, steroids and antihistamines and after a few hours I went home.Now slowly on the path to recovery, Jes is extremely self-conscious of how she looks and fears her eyebrows may fall out and never grow back.Jes said: I feel awful looking in the mirror seeing myself like this. I went out for lunch with the kids and two little children came up to me and said aposwhataposs wrong with your eyebrows apos I told them I burnt them, I was so self-conscious.When I went to AE I ended up putting my face mask over my eyebrows because I didnapost want people to look at me, itaposs just embarrassing and I should know better.The beautician is now urging everyone to always patch test before doing DIY eyebrow tints.Jes said: I wanted to share what happened to make people aware so they donapost go through what I have, itaposs definitely not worth it.Since sharing this Iaposve had so many people saying aposoh now I realise the importance of doing patch testsapos.Iaposm qualied, itaposs what I do, I knew Iaposd have a reaction but I just did not expect this at all, especially as it was only on for two minutes.Donapost even take the risk of not doing a patch test as you could end up with no eyebrows.You can actually die from this, a serious allergic reaction is not something to be messed around with.At AE they said I could have gone blind because it was so close to my eye, itaposs just not worth it.An Eylure spokesman said: We always advise that a patch test must be carried out - hours prior to any form of dye application as stated on our packaging, evenyou are a regular user and have previously patch tested.

Hellen Hetherington was walking down a stone stairway hand-in-hand with her new husband when he suddenly lost his footing. She fell too and ended up at the bottom of the steps. Hellen had to be rushed to hospital in an ambulance and missed her own wedding night. Her lawyers claim she suffered the injury because the exterior staircase was not lit. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  However, the owner of the stately home denies liability and the events company involved says the fall was a “pure accident”. Details of the case have emerged after papers were filed at the High Court. In the claim lawyer Wanda Szcygiel, acting for Hellen, wrote: “She waited for her husband before continuing to walk towards the marquee at the same time as her husband. “First the claimant’s husband, then the claimant fell almost at the same time. The claimant fell to the left. The claimant’s husband fell to the right. “The steps were inadequately lit and could not be seen, causing the claimant to fall as she could not make out the beginning of the stairs.”  Hellen’s accident happened in June  during her wedding reception at -year-old Sennowe Park - a historic country pile in Norfolk. The huge Edwardian country house was built in  by Thomas Albert Cook, who was the grandson of travel agency pioneer Thomas Cook. After enjoying her wedding and reception in the grounds of the stately home she and her husband retired to the bridal suite before midnight. They were on the way back to the marquee when she fell while descending stone steps connecting two terraces. Hellen, who works as head of procurement at a farmers’ buying group, initially needed round-the-clock care when she was recovering.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  She claims she is still suffering ongoing effects from the injury, which has impacted her ability to drive. In the court claim she blames both Sennowe Park and booking agent Softley Events for what happened. However, estate owner Charles Temple-Richards and the events company deny being at fault. In its defence to the action, Softley Events’ barrister Jamie Clarke argued an account given by Hellen’s husband proved the fall was an accident. Mr Clarke said: “The claimant’s husband explained in a calm manner that he had been holding the claimant’s hand whilst they were walking down the steps when he suddenly lost his footing and fell forward, adding that it was fortunate that he was very fit and in good shape as he had been able to roll and avoid a serious injury. “However, when he missed his footing, the claimant’s husband pulled the claimant down with him and she fell to the bottom of the steps. “Neither the claimant’s husband nor anybody  at the time made any reference to or criticism of illumination of the steps or of any other aspect of the condition of the steps as being a factor or factors in the alleged events. “The claimant’s husband’s account at the time describes a pure accident that was not attributable to any external factor.” Barrister Thomas Banks, for Mr Temple-Richards, said the steps were over  years old and were a “period feature” of the house. He said: “The claimant was aware of the steps, having been up and down them several times, and they were clearly visible as the claimant approached them. “It is specically denied that the steps were unlit. Suitable lighting was in place.” The case reached court earlier this month ahead of a full trial of the claim at a later date.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMarriageWeddingsStately homesWedding dayAccidentsCourt case"},{"url":null,"title":"england now more blue flag","story":"NewsEngland now has more Blue Flag beaches than Cyprus and Malta - full list of all There is growing uncertainty around foreign holidays this summer, but many Brits considering staycations, England now has more Blue Flag awarded seaside spots than some of the worlds top holiday destinationsmirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY NewsCrowds enjoy a day at the beach in Margate \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.Sign Up!When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Former DSI John Bennett, of Gloucestershire police, was the man given the daunting task of piecing together Fred and Rose West’s decades of evil as the bodies began to pile up at  Cromwell Street in . But in his  memoir on the dreadful case, now retired detective Bennett revealed Mary was in their thoughts from the moment Fred first appeared in court as he had covered her disappearance as a junior cop himself decades earlier. Mary, , vanished on January , , while waiting for a bus in Gloucester and no trace of her was ever found. This week detectives have been scouring a cafe she used to work in hope of finding her body after a new tip-off. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Little did young frogman Bennett, who searched for her in the freezing waterways of Gloucester realise, but he would come face to face with her suspected killer Fred West years later. And it is a theory he did not discount during the investigation – the problem was evidence. Co-authored by BBC journalist Graham Gardner his memoir gives a blow-by-blow account of the investigation from Bennett’s perspective. In it he painted a picture of Mary as an innocent girl snatched cruelly from le.  “It soon became apparent that this pretty girl, who measured around ft in, was slim with blond, shoulderhair and came from a well-respected local family, was just a normal teenager of the time. “She had the occasional under-age drink with friends of her age and often went to the local Pop In cafe ...but otherwise she did what her parents asked her. “She was thrty and spent her pocket money on make-up and stockings. There was no reason for her to go missing that night and every reason for not to.” At the time DCI Bennett had little doubt Fred was involved but Fred refused to admit to it so the team set about trying to force his hand.  The book explains: “Bennett was in no doubt that Mary Bastholm was not one of the nine found at Cromwell Street but her disappearance was similar to that of Lucy Partington and possibly some other victims. “Yet the investigation had revealed that Fred West had worked in Bristol Road where she disappeared and the Pop in and the cafe may have been a regular haunt for both of them. “Certainly the media had latched on to this and made it the basis for speculation connecting West with the cafe, her disappearance and the victims. “Bennett accepted they might well be right for the theory had been discussed in briefings, but there was no evidence yet and they already had enough on their plate.

It remained unsearched until this week thanks to ‘new evidence’ from a documentary film crew. At the time West’s son Stephen claimed his dad confessed to him he had killed Mary but a weary Bennett concluded he could not trust fantasist West dismissing him at that point in the probe as a “chameleon.”  Gloucestershire Police said forensic assessment work would continue until Monday, before a more “considered decision” was made as to the extent of excavation. Police also defended the decision in  not to excavate the cafe, as there was “insufficient evidence” the teenager was buried there. West was charged with  murders, but took his own le in a Birmingham prison before his trial. Rose West was convicted of  murders in November  and is serving le.The Cromwell Street Murders: The Detective’s Story is available online and published by The History Press.

First time buyers Jackson Higginbottom and his partner, Holly, have finally had an offer accepted after battling to get a foot on the housing ladder for years.They had been gazumped several times, but finally struck a deal in a location that would traditionally have been way out of their price range, Cornwall Live reports.They later discovered that the seller of the house in Sennen, Cornwall, had rejected two huge offers - because he wanted to keep the house affordable for local people in the area, who are typically on lower wages.  Jackson said: As soon as you see somewhere you like… it’s gone. When you’re talking houses out of our price range, then fair enough. But when it’s first-time buyer prices, and they’re going like that, you can’t help but think, ‘for God’s sake’. It’s obviously locals after that, can’t people give us a bit of a chance  Jackson, a surfer, said when he saw the house in surf-mecca Sennen he instantly rushed to the bank to put in an offer - for the exact asking price. But he never expected it to be accepted, so was shocked to receive a call saying that the house was his. He continued: There’s us thinking we’re really stretching to offer that asking price. We don’t even know the guy, but he has done the bloody decent thing and turned away these offers. For us, we’d paid a higher deposit and took a while to get everything sorted as first-time buyers. He had seven months to hold off from tourists and wealthy cash buyers. Jackson said he was was incredibly grateful, but “amazed” to see just how hard it is to secure a home as a first time buyer in Cornwall. He added: It shouldn’t even be a story - ‘couple grows up and buys a house when they’re  in their local area’. But clearly it is. It feels like you’re being kicked out of where you grew up, to sum it up. We’re both surfers, we both want our kids to grow up here too. We’re outdoors people, we don’t want to go to the city and live that le. To have our upbringing and then find that we can’t afford to live here is horrible. Most of us never have any chance of living here.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFirst-time buyersproperty news"},{"url":null,"title":"indian covid variant areas highest","story":"NewsIndian Covid iant: Areas with highest number of cases - how many are in your region New figures show cases of the Indian coronavirus iant are soaring, with the highest totals in London and the North West of England as the country prepares to ease its lockdownmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-headlines--warning-over-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:UOsznw,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Four people have died after contracting the iant, Public Health Englandconfirmed. It is certainly possible the Indian iant could overtake the Kent iant and become the countryaposs dominant strain, expert Dr Duncan Robertson told the Mirror.By region in England, London had the highest number of confirmed and suspected cases of the mutant iant -  as of Wednesday, accounting for almost a third of total Covid cases in the capital.The North West was not far behind, with its total of  infections making up a quarter of all confirmed and probable cases of coronavirus in the region, which includes Greater Manchester. Have you tested positive for the Indian coronavirus iant  Email your story to webnews@mirror.  Given the rapid spread in some areas, the Government is facing calls to consider postponing the planned easing of most Covid restrictions in England in June.Local lockdowns  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out local lockdowns being necessary to contain the spread of the virus, admitting the Government was “anxious” about the iant. Surge testing has been launched in  areas, including Bolton, Formby and parts of London, while increased genomic sequencing and enhanced contact tracing are among other measures being used to prevent the spread of the iant, the Government said. The Government is also considering bringing forward the date for a second dose of vaccine for eligible groups to increase protection.  Data from PHE shows a rise in cases of the Indian iant from  to , this week in the UK, with the agency saying cases were “rising in the community” and it was assessing the impact and severity of the iant. Three types of the B.. iant, first detected in India, are circulating within the UK, and it is B... that is spreading fast and causing concern. London and the North West have reported the highest number of cases of that strain, which the World Health Organisation has classied as a iant of global concern. In London, the proportion of confirmed and probable cases caused by the B... iant has surged to just under  per cent, while it is . per cent in the North West.  About a quarter of the  total cases in London were people who had travelled. In the North West, where there is widespread community transmission, the proportion of travellers among the  cases was much lower . The number of cases linked to people who had travelled to the UK from India soared in April, figures show. How many cases in your region  Here is a regional breakdown of the PHE data :London - North West - East - East Midlands - South East - West Midlands - South West - Yorkshire and Humber - North East -  In Bolton, which has one of the highest case rates of the iant in the country, mobile testing units have been deployed and door-to-door PCR Covid testing has been offered to , residents.

Measures have also been brought in where, including in parts of London. Variant aposmight be dominantapos in two regions In a tweet, Professor Christina Pagel, a mathematician and professor of operational research at University College London, said the iant might already be dominant in London and the North West, based on the PHE figures and using S gene detection as a proxy.  Professor Pagel, a member of Independent Sage, added: I thinkwe just know too little about B... except that itaposs spreading rapidly and the risks are quite high. Dr Robertson, a coronavirus modeller at Loughborough University, told the Mirror that experts cannot be certain where the iant is becoming dominant as it takes time for conclusive sequencing of samples. He added: B... cases appear to be rising in North West England and London and cases have been detected in Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, Bedford, and Sefton. Some of these cases can be traced back to travellers, but many appear to be due to transmission within the community.  On Thursday, Professor James Naismith, from the University of Oxford, warned the Indian iant should be viewed as a country-wide problem, telling BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “It will get everywhere. We keep learning this lesson, but we know that this will be the case.” A PHE report published late on Thursday suggests the transmissibility of the Indian iant is similar to the Kent iant and may be slightly higher. Cases of the Indian iant are also growing at a faster rate than for the Kent iant. It is too soon to predict whether the Indian iant could overtake the Kent strain and become the dominant iant across the whole of the nation. Dr Robertson said: We saw that the Kent iant - B... - became dominant in the new year, and we are seeing signs that some areas are now having cases dominated by B....  It’s finely balanced. The so-called secondary attack rate is very similar between B...and B... . Basically, we need more time and more data to be more certain. But the high numbers of cases and the high levels of transmissibility mean that it is certainly possible for B... to become dominant – although there may be other iants that emerge that also compete. Dr Robertson said PHE is doing an excellent job collecting and analysing data, and surge testing is helping to gather better data. The Government on Friday said Boris Johnsonaposs June  lockdown road map easing – when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted – was still on track despite the latest figures. Dr Robertson said the Government must be cautious as any risk-taking could increase the likelihood of tougher lockdowns at a national or local level down the road.  He added: With all unlocking decisions, it is a balance of risk and reward – the rewards of being able to meet people indoors more easily but the risk of that causing increased transmission and case rates increasing. “We are in a dferent position to late last year. Much of the population is now vaccinated but by no means all. The virus will find the most vulnerable and will causes cases to be found. The question is how many of these cases go on to be hospitalised and die. It is a real risk, and one that only the Government can take. But taking that risk does mean that the potential for reintroduction of more stringent lockdown measures, either at a local or a national level, increases. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the Government was “anxious” about the iant and “there is a range of things we could doas he refused to rule out the possibility of local lockdowns. Despite the spread of the Indian iant, Mr Johnson said there was “nothing that dissuades me” from easing England’s lockdown on Monday or the further steps towards normality on June . But he added “there may be things we have to do locally and we will not hesitate to do themthat is the advice we get”. Nadhim Zahawi urged people in the  areas of England with spread of the Indian iant of concern to follow local health advice, get tested and isolatethey test positive. Askedthe June  road map easing – when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted – could be put on ice, Mr Zahawi told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that this Monday’s reopening of indoor meet-ups “is still on”. When pressed on whether the plans for June  could be paused, Mr Zahawi said on Friday: “The way we don’t have to do that is by everybody doing their bit, by taking the two tests a week, doing your PCR test in those areas, and to isolate, isolate, isolate. “We have got to break the cycle of infection, because one of those big tests was infection rates have to be suppressed, and the other big test is iants. “If those cause a problem, then the tests will fail. The four tests have to be met for June .” Mr Zahawi said the seven-day rolling average figures for infection show a . per cent rise, but hospital admissions are down by . per cent. “That is good news because it tells you that the vaccines are clearly working in terms of hospitalisation and severe infections… but the infection rate is what is concerning, which is why we have to surge test and then isolate,” he said. Figures compiled by PA show that  per cent of Englandaposs  local areas have seen an increase in coronavirus infection ratesin the seven days to May . Bolton in Greater Manchester has the highest rate, with  new cases in the seven days to May  – the equivalent of . cases per , people. This is up from . in the seven days to May .

Yet the Kray twinsapos self-styled legend is also one of celebrity pals, sex scandals and a turbulent home le. A new Britbox documentary, Secrets of the Krays, has lted the lid on Reggie and Ronnieaposs rise to fame, charting the beginnings of their criminal empire through to their eventual arrest and imprisonment in .Speaking to The Mirror this week, their cousin also revealed the shocking tale of their upbringing, including their awful dad who abused their mum and threatened to maul her with acidshe ever left.It set the thugs on a path to violence that saw them clash with Londonaposs sadistic gang lords, before befriending serial killers as they faced a le behind bars. From claims of an incestuous relationship to Reggieaposs baffling friendship with EastEnders star Shane Ritchie, here we look back at the wild le of the notorious gangsters. aposCigarette punchapos and gut-wrenching murder Running their crime syndicate from Bethnal Green, the Kray twinsapos violent reputation helped them keep a tight grip on power. While Ronnie was regarded as the more apospsychoticapos brother, Reggie was no gentleman either - reportedly having a sure-fire way to break a jaw in one hit. Dubbed the aposcigarette punchapos, it would see him offer his victim a fag before striking as they opened their mouth, leaving them writhing in pain.  The Kray syndicateaposs toughest rivals were the Richardsons, who were considered the most sadistic mob in London, with a penchant for pulling teeth out using pliers, cutting off toes with bolt cutters and even nailing their victims to the floor. When Ronnie shot dead a member of the gang, George Cornell, at the Blind Beggar pub in March , it sparked a chain of events that would eventually lead to the twinsapos imprisonment. A year after Cornellaposs death, the pair killed Jack aposthe Hatapos McVitie, whose gruesome death went down in infamy.  McVitie was a minor member of the Kray gang who had failed to fulfil a £, contract paid to him in advance to kill a rival. As punishment, he was lured to a basement flat in Stoke Newington, on the pretence of a party. After he entered, Reggie pointed a handgun at his head and pulled the trigger twice, but the gun failed to discharge. Instead, Ronnie held McVitie in a bearhug and Reggie stabbed him to death with a carving kne – pulling out his liver, which later had to be flushed down the toilet. In March , the Krays were sentenced to le imprisonment over the two murders, with a non-parole period of  years - the longest sentences ever passed at the Old Bailey for murder. Cooking with Moors murderer in jail The brothers were kept apart in prison, with Reggie first sent to HMP Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight and Ronnie locked up at HMP Durham, where he spent spells in solitary confinement for fighting with guards. Here, Ronnie is said to have struck up a sick friendship with Ian Brady, the notorious Moors murderer who killed five children with Myra Hindley in the s. In a letter to a penpal, Brady wrote: “Ronnie Kray and I did the cooking at Durham A Level Security Wing, in the s after three riots there.”  The convictsapos bond appeared even more twisted after it emerged the Krays had also befriended Ann Downey, whose daughter Lesley Ann, , was abducted, raped, tortured and killed by Brady and Hindley. Discovering a stash of letters after Annaposs death, son Terry said: “They are not the kind of letters you would expect from criminals like the Krays. “Everyone knows how vicious the Krays could be. Maybe mum was trying to find out more about Brady in prison. Over the decades, the brothersapos time in jail proved nearly as eventful as their le on the outside. Reggie later claimed to have become a born-again Christian, while Ronnie got married in Broadmoor to a former topless kissogram girl. Brothersapos aposincestuousapos relationship Unusually for their era - and even more so in the criminal underworld - Ronnie was openly gay, while Reggie was rumoured to be bisexual. However, biographer John Pearson caused a stir when he revealed a shocking secret about their sex lives - claiming the pair had at one point engaged in an incestuous relationship. Speaking to The Sun, John said: “Homosexuality was nothing to be proud of in the East End.“But as they became more and more notorious, Ronnie became quite shameless about it. “According to Ron, in the early days they had sex with each other, because they were terried about people finding out.” While Ronnie came out to his family and had a number of boyfriends, Reggie repeatedly denied that he was bisexual.Yet Laurie OaposLeary, a childhood friend of the Krays, told theit was an open secret between the brothers.I would say that Reg fought the fact he could also be bisexual more than Ron, but I knew of his affection for quite a few young male teenagers with whom he kept company, said OaposLeary. Ron would goad Reg when he went out with women and tried to influence Reg with his own appetite for young men. aposAwfulapos dad threatened mum with acid The Kraysapos cruel streak is said to stem from their turbulent upbringing, which saw them clash with their abusive dad.Cousin Kim Peat told The Mirror that their father, known as Old Charlie, would regular beat their mum Violet and threaten her with acidshe ever left. “He was an awful man,” Kim said. “He was horrible to Violet – violent from day one. They married in  when she was  but had to edit her date of birth as she was expecting her eldest son, Charlie. “Old Charlie gave her black eyes, bloodied noses. That’s where the twins’ violent streak came from. He saidshe ever left him he’d throw acid in her face and no one would look at her again.” She added that the monster only stopped abusing Violet when Ronnie threatened his father. “Ronnie was  when Old Charlie punched Violet in the nose, she said. “He ran downstairs, punched his dad in the nose and said, ‘If you ever touch my mother again, I will effing kill you’. Old Charlie never beat her again.” Pals with the Mafia... and EastEndersapos Shane Richie The twinsapos celebrity status was cemented at the funeral of Reggie, who died from cancer in October . Among the wreaths from mourners were displays from famous admirers including The Who singer Roger Daltry and pop star Morrissey.  There was also a wreath believed to be from the American Mafia - next to a photo of Manhattan was the message: In deep respect, from your friends in New York. The thugs had a string of A-list stars in their contact book, many of whom were business associates as well as pals. In , Frank Sinatra was said to have hired  bodyguards from Krayleigh Enterprises, which was the Kraysapos protection company. Meanwhile, painter Lucian Freud reportedly racked up more than £, in gambling debts to the twins, even wriggling out of an exhibition opening in fear of them showing up and demanding their money.  Perhaps most bizarrely of all, though, was Reggieaposs apparent friendship with EastEnders actor Shane Richie. The Iaposm a Celeb star, , visited Reggie in jail during the s and wrote in his memoir that he once told the gangster about an agent who had failed to hand over an £, fee. He said: I gave him the guy’s name but thought no more of it. I don’t know exactly to this day what happened but word has it Reggie made a call, the agent told him where to go, and, low and behold, his office was burnt down. Shane added: Was is it a coincidence  I don’t think so.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnThe KraysRonnie KrayReggie Kray"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

PC Jack Wood, , denied assaulting Jake Smith, , who suffered a gaping gash to his skull on January  last year in Romford, Essex. He and colleague PC Archie Payne, , were convicted over striking Mr Smithaposs friend Scott Rooney, , who was grabbed by the throat and thrown to the ground. Mr Rooney, a railway engineer, claimed he was the victim of an unprovoked attack after trying to take a picture of PC Wood and his officer number. CCTV footage of the incident was shown to the court in London today. Mr Smith suffered two wounds to his head, .cm and cm ineach, as well as cm of bruising to his chest wall, the court heard. Both officers denied the charges against them.  Defending PC Wood, Robert Morris argued Mr Smith and his friend were binge drinking for ten hours and then aposrugby tackledapos other punters outside the pub. He told District Judge Nina Tempia there was aposno case to answerapos and claimed the officer had only acted as legally permitted to stop the bust-up. Mr Morris said: By the time that PC Payne and PC Wood were running towards the group, Mr Smith was on his feet and was aggressively moving towards the group. Not on his back, unable to defend himself. His actions were plainly to rugby tackle an inidual who was at some distance.  Not content with that, Mr Smith throws himself against a woman who was not involved in either group and who seems to have wandered into the melee and she is then knocked to the floor. What is plain, is that any reasonable person entering that situation would have reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Smith has committed offences of assault and affray. Mr Morris said PC Wood did not run into the fracas with the baton in hand, telling the court instead he took a measured approach and acted proportionately. The counsel told the courtthe police officer had sat back and done nothing he would have been criticised, and denied that he had immediately gone in to strike Mr Smith with the baton. He continued: In my submission, Mr Wood entered the affray properly, used force that he was permitted to use and the struggling only stopped when the baton was used. Prosecutor Nicola Shannon told the trial at City of London Magistratesapos Court there had been an argument between Mr Rooney and another punter, prompting two security guards to ask them to leave. She said they stayed for one more drink but, upon leaving, realised the man they had clashed with was outside with a number of others. The group was between the pub and the bus stop that Mr Rooney, who lived locally, needed to get to.  So the pair asked PC Wood and PC Payne, who were outside the pub on patrol, to escort them to the bus stop past the group, the court heard. Ms Shannon continued: The officers declined to do so, telling the grouphe was their friend itaposs not their responsibility to help, and ed to their patrol duties. Mr Rooney was attacked by the group... but shortly after that PC Wood ran into the scene, came behind Mr Smith, raised his baton and inflicted between three to four strikes. The prosecutor said while Mr Smith had his back towards the officer PC Wood appears to go from right to left with the baton held above his head in an overarm motion brings it down towards Mr Smith.  PC Payne is seen on the footage making a aposkicking motionapos at Mr Smith while he was on the ground. While PC Payne and a colleague had their body-worn cameras activated, PC Wood did not activate his until later, said the prosecutor. After Mr Smith was treated in an ambulance the officers ed to arrest him for affray, but the charge was later discontinued, the court heard. PC Wood, based at Romford Police Station, was convicted one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Mr Scott and one count of assault by beating against Mr Rooney.  He will next be sentenced on  June at Westminster Magistratesapos Court. PC Payne, formerly based at the same station, was convicted of one count of common assault against Mr Rooney. He was ordered to pay a total of £, in compensation and court costs. Judge Tempia told the court her judgment was PC Wood did not use reasonable force. PC Wood had smashed Mr Smith twice on the head - despite the officer claiming he aimed for the shoulder, the judge continued, adding: I find all the civilian witnesses credible. Itaposs very clear to me that Mr Rooney was acting reasonably and calmly when he was asking for PC Woodaposs number, he had his arms behind his back. I also find that Mr Rooney did not have Mr Payne in a headlock.The judge told PC Wood he didnapost have to punch Mr Rooney at all, and I do not believe he used lawful and reasonable force to assist Mr Payne.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore Onpolitan PoliceCCTVCCTV footageCourt caseWetherspoons"},{"url":null,"title":"over half areas england see","story":"NewsOver half of all areas of England see Covid cases rise as Indian iant fears growOf  local areas in England, % have seen a rise in coronavirus rates in the past week, as Boris Johnson warns surges driven by the Indian iant could threaten hopes of a June  unlockingmirrorShareCommentsByJoe GammieTalia ShadwellReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video johnson-indian-iant-could-pose-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:lXNoLB,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

One source criticised the Sussexes, saying Harry giving an interview to actor Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast wouldnapost help matters amid a rt between the duke and his family, including his older brother Prince William.What did you think of Harryaposs interview on the Armchair Expert podcast  Join the conversation in the comments section below.The source told the Daily Mail: They appear to be making careers of talking about their previous ones.It is not helpful. Palace insiders also noted nothing ever appears to be their own fault, the report added. Royal biographer Angela Levin accused Harry of being incredibly rude and said the interview was ruthlessly cruel towards the Queen, who is grieving following the death of her husband. Ms Levin told Good Morning Britain: He is being incredibly rude again - nobody minds what he does, he just seems to lash back at family in the most unpleasant, disloyal way.Thereaposs also sort of nonsense there, or potential nonsense, because he says Meghan told him to get help, but when I interviewed him atin  I asked him aposAre you going because Meghan suggested it, has she persuaded youapos, and he said aposAbsolutely not, she had nothing to do with it, it was Williamapos. She suggested Harry gave an interview too soon after Philipaposs funeral. Senior royals, including the Queen, Charles and William, have already been back at work. Ms Levin said: Thereaposs a lack of understanding of anyone aposs position - poor Prince Charles, who as we saw when the funeral took place was absolutely devastated, and the Queen at  bravely went to open Parliament, but you could tell it was not the same Queen.

Harry, who is expecting a daughter with we Meghan and is already father to son Archie, aged two, compared his le to “a mixture between The Truman Show and being in a zoo”. Speaking on the podcast, he said: “There is no blame. I don’t think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting,I’ve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don’t pass it on, basically. “It’s a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say ‘you know what, that happened to me, I’m going to make sure that doesn’t happen to you’.”  He added: “It’s hard to do but for me it comes down to awareness. I never saw it, I never knew about it, and then suddenly I started to piece it together and go ‘OK, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his le, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he’s treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids ’ “And here I am, I moved my whole family to the US, that wasn’t the plan but sometimes you’ve got make decisions and put your family first and put your mental health first.” He compared living under scrutiny as a member of the royal family to the  film The Truman Show, starring Jim Carrey as a man oblivious to the fact that his entire le is a TV show, and to being an animal in a zoo. He also revealed that he met up with his future we in a London supermarket in the early days of their relationship and the couple pretended not to know each other. He said: “The first time Meghan and I met up for her to come and stay with me, we met up in a supermarket in London, pretending as though we didn’t know each other, texting each other from the other ends of the aisle. “There were people looking at me, giving me all of these weird looks, coming up to say hi or whatever but there I am texting her whilst we’re shopping, askingthis is the right thing and she’s replying ‘No, you want the parchment paper’. “It was nice with a baseball cap on looking down at the floor, walking along the street and trying to stay incognito. “Not sure how many times I’ve done that, trying to walk down the street and stay incognito is like ‘whoa signpost, someone’s dog’, it’s amazing how much chewing gum you see and how many shoes. “So living herenow I can actually lt my head and I feel dferent, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that.” The podcast follows Harry and Meghanaposs bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, which was watched by tens of millions of people in March. The couple claimed a Royal Family member made a racist comment about their unborn son and the institution did not offer help to Meghan when she was in poor mental health.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRoyal FamilyPrince HarryMeghan Markle"},{"url":null,"title":"popular man 20 took life","story":"NewsPopular man, , took le after struggling with domestic abuse he suffered as childMarc Palin was rushed to hospital after being found by people walking in a country park in Farnworth, Bolton on May  last year but sadly passed away just hours latermirrorShareCommentsByKit Vickery:,  MAY NewsPopular footballer Marc Palin,  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors had to tell his devastated family he would be severely brain damagedhe lived.But Marcaposs condition worsened during the night and he sadly died in the early hours of May , reports the Manchester Evening News.A hearing at Bolton coroneraposs court heard that the former Breightmet Wanderers AFC player had lived a dficult le.  Jenner Palin, his mum, wept as the court heard of the horric ordeal Marc’s father had put the pair of them through. The youngster watched on in horror as his dad brutally attacked his mum, stabbing her  times when he was just three years old. Whilst his mum recovered from her injuries, Marc was sent to live with a foster family in Cleveland, where he was subjected to abuse of his own, which was revealed years later during a counselling session. Marc reported the abuse to police, who told him that they couldn’t pursue any convictions because there was insufficient evidence, it was said. He was left “devastated” by the decision, the inquest heard, sparking a struggle with depression.  Assistant coroner Simon Nelson said on Thursday Marc had “opened a can of worms” by acknowledging the abuse, struggling to deal with the incident and feeling like no one believed him. Marc struggled to manage his mental health for years, being prescribed antidepressants and starting counselling in , before stopping this treatment a short time later. Karen Dalley, a mental health liaison practitioner at Royal Bolton Hospital, saw Marc just over  hours before he tried to take his own le. She said: “He expressed a lot of frustration about past trauma, his experiences in foster care, and frustration around the outcome of the investigation. “He said he felt empty inside but he was very specic in saying he didn’t want to end his le because he didn’t want to cause his parents any distress.

Tragically, Marc continued to struggle, and made the decision to take his own le the next day. He left his family home in Red Lane, Breightmet, for the final time just after .pm. Recording a conclusion of “suicide whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed”, Mr Nelson said: “If only he would have been with someone,he had been able to verbalise those thoughts we may not have been here today. “I think that the events from his childhood have been a catalyst and the primary reason for him acting as he did. “I don’t believe he would have taken his own le had he not been so grievously affected by these events. “He was only  when he died but you have spoken about some very fine qualities. “You mention how caring he was, how he fought for the underdog - all very impressive traits which I hope he will be remembered for for many a year.” Samaritansoperates a -hour service available every day of the year.

She said: The night before, I had been in my friendaposs hot tub and doctors told me I may have contracted the infection through a small cut on my foot whilst in the hot tub. Hot tubs are filled with bacteria so itaposs likely that could have been the cause. I went to sleep that night feeling a bit nauseous but my friend found me in the early hours of the next morning gasping for breath on the floor.

I thought they had taken me to the wrong window when I saw her I fell to the floor and begged God to save her and not to let her go.  Sheaposs my only child - sheaposs my baby and doctors told me it was unlikely she would survive longer than  hours. They would regularly take Lauren down to theatre to clean the feet up and check everything and on this one particular day, she was in there all day and I knew something must have been happening. When I found out about the amputations, I dropped down on the floor again because I knew how this would impact her quality of le.

Bolton and Bury councils are asking secondary schools and colleges to keep face coverings in place until further notice following a surge in cases. The advice comes after the Government confirmed that it will remove the face mask requirement for pupils in England from Monday, when more indoor mixing is allowed when restrictions are lted further. A school leaders unionapos said it supported the schools which were planning to extend the use of face coverings among pupils beyond next week, adding that they are best placed to make the call.  MPs and parents have raised concerns about face masks in class disrupting pupilsapos learning and wellbeing since they were introduced in March, but unions and scientists have called for them to remain in class for longer to ensure pupils, staff, parents and the community are not put at risk of infection. The Indian iant of coronavirus has been detected in Bolton, Greater Manchester, as well as in Blackburn, Lancashire, and Sefton in Merseyside, which have all seen rates rise rapidly. The directors of public health from Lancashire County Council and Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council are advising schools and colleges across the county to keep face masks in place until June . Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, Lancashire County Councilaposs director of public health, said: This is a very tough recommendation to make at a time when the restrictions are set to ease nationally on Monday May . But the increase in prevalence of this iant in the North West means we need to take some prudent steps to help reduce its spread.  Wearing face coverings in schools and colleges for a few weeks longer will help to contain this and ensure the iant doesnapost take hold. This is vital so we can build on the good work to keep levels of infection, hospital admissions and the numbers of people becoming seriously ill low. A letter from Bolton council to parents said it was asking schools to retain the use of face coverings, as per the current arrangements, until further notice. Bolton is the area with the highest rate of cases, with  new infections in the seven days to May . The letter, from the councilaposs childrenaposs services and public health directors, said: There have been instances where young people attending school or college have contributed to the spread of the virus. We believe it would be irresponsible to wait until we have higher levels of the newer iants of Sars-CoV circulating before we act.  A similar letter has been sent from Bury council to parents advising face masks to be retained in class and the council said all secondary schools and colleges in the area are following the advice. Julien Kramer, interim assistant director of education and inclusion at Bury council, wrote: We have made signicant progress in reducing cases of Covid-, there is a risk that this progress is undermined by the spread of this more infectious iant. Widespread transmission of this iant would risk slowing down or reversing the progress we have made towards removing restrictions on meeting family and friends and reopening businesses. I am sure that you will understand the need for caution at this time. Children at secondary schools in Selby, North Yorkshire, are also being advised to continue wearing masks beyond next week due to high transmission rates. Local director of public health Louise Wallace said: In consultation with education colleagues, we have therefore taken the common sense approach of suggesting schools consider continuing to use face coverings in those geographic areas where the Covid positive rates are highest. Seftonaposs public health team has also advised that masks should be worn in schools beyond Monday in areas which are currently experiencing outbreaks. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: We are aware that some schools are intending to extend the use of face masks among pupils beyond Monday. We back schools in the decisions they make. They best know their context and how their parents, staff, and pupils feel about the issue of face masks and they are therefore best placed to make a call on how to respond to the Governmentaposs guidance. There is also provision in the Government guidance for local action committees to reintroduce the use of face masks for pupils on a temporary basis in response to localised outbreaks, including iants of concern, and for decisions to be made by local directors of public health. There is clearly a great deal of concern about the iant which originated in India and the situation is obviously going to be fluid in the immediate future with regards to face masks.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationHospitalsSchoolsSecondary schoolIce skatingSarsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"snobby neighbours put note parked","story":"NewsSnobby neighbours put note on parked Skoda saying car makes street look like BeirutJulia Laursen was told her blue hatchback brought down their \"respectable\" neighbourhood and looked more like it belonged in a dump than in the street in Shanklin, Isle of WightmirrorShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video snobby-neighbours-say-skoda-brought-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:IZWbKYK,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Or that is what he’d have the world believe following an interview this week. In a podcast, he told American actor Dax Shepard that only by moving , miles to the US west coast has he been able to break free from his “genetic pain”. Quite how much “genetic pain” his words cause those with whom he actually shares his genes – his brother, his father, the Queen – cannot be imagined. But certainly his new family we Meghan, friends Oprah Winfrey, James Corden and Gayle King have nothing but pride for his new-found “honesty”. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Over here, Harry’s words, spoken with new American upspeak, put him at the centre of a new outrage.Just as his family comes to terms with Prince Philip ’s death, Harry fired: “When it comes to parenting,I’ve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don’t pass it on.”Piers Morgan, who quit Good Morning Britain after a row over Meghan’s Oprah chat, was incensed: “How many more times is this spoiled brat going to publicly trash the dad who’s bankrolled him his entire le ” For someone who fled the UK to get out of the limelight, Harry has been carrying out an extraordinary number of interviews and public appearances.  Less than a fortnight ago he received a standing ovation after giving a speech at the Vax Live concert in Los Angeles. The dust is yet to settle on his Oprah interview which left the royal family feeling scorched, which quickly followed his prime-time chat with James Corden. Some might feel his personal outpourings are best kept to the privacy of a therapist’s office. Yet his fans agree it is only by distancing himself from his family and talking about his “trauma” that he is going to be able to become a good father to his two-year-old son and soon-to-be-born daughter.  For all the sense of duty we have seen from our Queen, Charles and William, their family situation has been unusual at best. Dysal at worst. Among the palaces, privileges, titles, land, jewels and fortunes handed down there have been unwelcome traits too. Harry grew up the son of a woman who suffered bulimia and mental health disorders. Traumatised by her parents’ acrimonious orce and custody battle when she was only seven, she was haunted by her mum Frances leaving the family home for a le with lover Peter Shand Kydd.  Close friends said the experience left Diana feeling needy and fragile. She was plagued with insecurities, suffered bulimia and is said to have attempted suicide. A similar pattern of marital disharmony scarred her sons. Prince Charles had an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now Harry’s stepmum. Diana believed it went on throughout the marriage.  Harry was sent to boarding school at eight, Eton at  and joined the British Army at . His parents separated in a blaze of publicity when he was eight and both admitted adultery on national television. He lost his mother aged . Harry’s relationship with his father has suffered. Charles stopped taking his calls after he fled Britain and their reunion at Philip’s funeral was said to be frosty.  The broken father-son bond also repeats that of the previous generation. Charles was forced by his father to go to his old school, Gordonstoun, in the s and hated its toughening-up exercises, like a daily run and cold shower. During world tours, the Queen and Philip left Charles with nannies for months. They were so emotionally and physically distant, reunions were celebrated with pecks on the cheek and formal handshakes.  Harry can now see some of his dad’s parenting was just learned behaviour. He said: “I started to piece it tog-ether and go, ‘OK, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his le, I know it’s connected to his parents so that means he’s treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my kids ’” This does not question the royal family’s service to our nation, but it does question what it must be like to grow up in it. Perhaps, as Harry suggests, it was a cycle of genetic pain. Psychologist Dr Pam Spurr says: “A person can successfully make a complete break from it by having an emotional and physical break, and not seeing their family. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. Sometimes that allows them to clear the slate and rebuild a new foundation.” Harry has chosen to uproot, but whether he is right to share his pain publicly is a dferent manner. He is at risk of turning the royal family into a posh episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show. Charles would not answer questions about Harry’s comments on Friday. Prince Philip said in : “I’ve never discussed private matters and I don’t think the Queen has either. Very few members of the family have.” Harry is breaking the cycle. Many of us Britons, particularly the older generation, will never be able to forgive anyone for airing dirty laundry. Younger people seem more forgiving. And let’s not forget this is Mental Health Awareness Week when people are encouraged to discuss feelings. However we cannot know how the feelings of the Queen, Charles and William have been affected by Harry’s emotional outpourings – or whether those feelings can ever be repaired.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyMental healthParenting"},{"url":null,"title":"up five visitors allowed per","story":"NewsUp to five visitors to be allowed per resident in care homes from MondayThe change comes as the nation moves into the next phase of its lockdown roadmap, the Department of Health and Social Care said, with named visitors allowed to attend two at a time or separately in updated guidancemirrorShareCommentsByTess de la MareJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe change comes as the nation moves into the next phase of its lockdown roadmap \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

To limit the infection risk, care home residents may not have more than two visitors in a day. Residents with special care needs may chose to nominate an essential carer as one of their five visitors. The carer will be exempt from the two visitors-a-day limit. Named visitors should be regularly tested, wear appropriate personal protective equipment and maintain social distancing, the DHSC said.

Seftonaposs response to rising infections came after David Greenhalgh, the leader of Bolton council, hinted that the UK government would give permission for surge vaccinations in certain areas. He is one of a number of local leaders who had asked ministers to let them vaccinate all over-s in areas where the virus is spreading rapidly. “This is an issue of capacity but we have had very, very constructive talks and certainly all the soundings are that they are looking to progress that as soon as possible, he said,reported.  Vaccines Minister Nadim Zahawi has told people living in Sefton, as well as Bolton, to get tested so the India iant outbreak could be controlled. He said: We need to work together, those viewers from Formby and Bolton where we are surge testing we can all play our part.

Anyone who knows us knows as a couple we do everything together - eat, sleep, work ,live, socialise...so naturally I decided to tag along. Novice Dora quickly got injured as she was unsure of what to do, so approached a personal trainer. She said: I ended up injuring my biceps pretty quickly. So I approached a personal trainer called Scott Atkinson who transformed my outlook, drive and canapost thank him enough. He has been amazing and trains both my husband Kyle and I. At the start of my personal training, I did full body workouts with a mix of cardio and weight training included.  It was nothing too intensive anda movement or exercise wasnapost for me or I didnapost like it it was changed instantly to something I was comfortable with. Unfortunately then lockdown hit - and the gym closed. But Dora managed to source some equipment at home so she could keep up her training. She added that, prior to her new diet, one of her worst habits was overeating. But she has now learnt to eat in moderation and control the calories. Dora said: My diet didnapost change at all at the start as Scott wanted to see my eating habits. I also suffer from a lot of food allergies so couldnapost eat foods that you would typically eat on a aposdietapos like nuts, fruits and certain vegetables. I would just eat and eat and eat and would never feel full with the rubbish foods I was eating, whereas now I feel full and satisfied with my meals.

I was an aposeat-cause-youaposre-boredapos kind of person, so nowIaposm bored I might go a walk or do something productive instead. Her calorie-controlled diet consists of protein yoghurts with zero-calorie syrup, homemade pizzas, and grilled meats with rice and veg. She also says that just because she is being healthy doesnapost mean that she doesnapost snack. Alongside her meals, she adds snacks to give her energy in-between and after her workouts. Snack time is the best time though and Iaposm sure most people will be like diet... snack time  What  but yes snack time, she said. I also try and hit a minimum of , steps a day and drink lots and lots of water throughout the day as well! Dora said that her regular training actually became a crutch for her and husband Kyle throughout lockdown, when their small business was forced to close during a time she described as dficult. Exercising let us take our minds off it and channel that into something positive. Even now being back open, after a full sht we still find the time to go to the gym and train as we both love it and itaposs changed our lives. I have enjoyed this journey so much that I have actually decided to change careers and become a personal trainer myself and am currently in the middle of completing my level  qualication as I want to help others achieve their goals and transform their lives like my PT did for me.Iaposve created an Instagram page to help anyone struggling with fitness, and give some insight into what I did to help lose weight.You have to be mentally ready for it and you have to be patient.

Suddenly unable to afford her rent and bills, Amy turned to the van le. Having done a few van trips before, Amy was no stranger to this nomadic lestyle and decided it could be the perfect way to maintain her freelance work whilst lowering her outgoing spends. Amy used her mortgage savings to purchase a Mercedes Sprinter WVB High Top van for £,. She then was able to completely fit the van for just £, despite having never dabbled in DIY before - spending several weeks carefully planning and watching YouTube tutorials.  To begin the build, Amy stripped the walls and proceeded to sound-deaden the van. Next, she installed insulation and had a technician install solar  and electrics. The vinyl flooring, wooden bulkhead wall, and headliner shelf were then fitted followed by the wood cladding. Amy proceeded to paint the cladding, build her furniture, added a water system and gas, and finally added homely d cor touches. Costs included a £, on electrics and a £ Bluetooth map system. To keep costs down, Amy repurposed old scaffolding boards by converting these into a worktop and table. She also reused blackout blinds she already owned and simply cut these down to size to fit the van.  Whereas Amy was previously spending £, on rent and household bills, her outgoing spends in the van are just £ - saving her an incredible £, per month. With the van only completed in April , Amy has yet to venture abroad but has frequented UK beauty spots over the past several weeks including Cornwall, Devon, and Kent. When conditions allow, Amy hopes to visit Wales, Scotland, and Europe. I was living in a flat and saving for a mortgage but when the pandemic hit, I lost all of my work and suddenly couldnapost afford rent, bills, or look to get a mortgage, Amy said.  I had done a few van trips before and had loved the simple le that living in a van brought. I also love travel and exploring and due to my work being remote, it is the perfect way to explore the UK whilst restrictions were in place. I also wanted a project for lockdown and so, converting my own van was the perfect fit. At the start, I looked at the whole project to try to break it down into stages. Then, with each stage, I researched and watched a lot of YouTube videos before tackling it myself.  I hadnapost done any DIY before this. I hadnapost even used a drill before. The van is dficult because there are no straight lines so cutting straight things like the bed frame was meticulously hard to get right and to get equal. It is also hard to manage space and the weight of the van. You have to take a lot into consideration such as the weight of the wood or where can save on space.I was working in awful weather including snow. I also had no idea what I was doing and often experienced lots of trial and error.Van living has become a hot topic in recent weeks due to feature film Nomadland sweeping up during this yearaposs awards season. Similar toAmyaposs experiences, the Oscar and BAFTA winning film tells the story of a woman, Fern, who takes to living the van le following an economic recession.The challenge has made me a stronger person mentally and Iaposve proved to myself that I can do anything I put my mind too, Amy said.

Claire Waldron has decided to put the three bedroom home she owns in Magheraboy, County Fermanagh on offer to be won.Whoever bags the lucky raffle ticket, which cost £ a piece, will bag themselves a semi-detached property boasting brand new appliances, stylish furniture and a huge garden area, the Irish Mirror reported. The -year-old bought the three bedroom house in  and moved in that year when her daughter was just nine. Now,  years later, Claire is raffling off the family home to raise money for her favourite animal charity, The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .  Claire says that before the pandemic she got a new kitchen in, all the new furniture, I did up my bedroom. It hasn’t been used much, no family parties of course, so it’s ready to go. “The reason I’m doing thatisI haven’t found somewhere to live after the raffle I’ll have to worry about storage and removal and it’s just a hassle. You can buy furniture anywhere.” Along with a fully furnished home, Claire is even leaving £, to the lucky winner. “I’m sure people will want to paint it their own way, she said.  I’ve got a few complaints about tiles at my front door. I have had emails saying ‘I don’t like your tiles, I’m not buying a ticketapos. “Everyone’s got their own personal taste, that’s why I’m giving €,as well, for people to be able to put their own mark on it.” The raffle will see  per cent of ticket revenue donated to the ISPCA, after Raffall, the raffle hosting website, has taken commission. “ per cent out of , ticket sales, it works out at about €, or €,,” she explains. With  days left to enter, there are over , raffle tickets sold so far. As support grows across social media and the ISPCA soon to get on board with advertising the fundraiser, Claire hopes to reach her goal of , tickets sold by October.“I’ve had contact with them , I’ve had to sign letters to say that this is kosher and that I am going to donate the money… so theyaposre going to get on board and start sharing it on their Instagram page, which will help, she continued.For the self-proclaimed “crazy dog lady,” choosing to donate to the ISPCA was a no-brainer. “There’s no actual rescue centres in Sligo, she said.  There’s Leitrim animal rescue which is the next county over and then there’s North West which covers Mayo… So the ISPCA has been covering all the trouble that the countyhas had. “I thought I’d pick them. They’re pretty central. They cover the whole of Ireland and they need the funds. Just like any other rescue centre.” Claire has run Walkies Doggy Daycare, a boarding and dog-walking service since  and says looking after animals is her “bread and butter.” “My daughter has three dogs and I have two dogs so there’s dogs everywhere, she said. Her daughter is expecting her first child this summer and Claire has plans to move into a smaller home with plenty of room for more canine activities. “It would be nice to move somewhere closer to my daughter, mind the kid and mind dogs, the mum said. On leaving her home she says: “I do love my house but I want more garden space, more land, shed units or an expansion so that I can have more dogs.” As well as expanding the “doggy daycare,” Claire is planning on fostering and adopting more dogs when she has the space to do so.  “The amount of people that got dogs during Covid is crazy. They’re all going to be going back to work this year or maybe next year, the rescue centres are going to be full and theyaposre already full to capacity.” “There’s no rescue centre in Sligo and I just want to be able to do something, animals are my le.” When asked of any plans for choosing potential new properties she says she’s not allowing herself to become attached to anywhere yet, “properties are being snapped up because everyone wants to get out of the city,” she explains. “I’m not getting my hopes up or setting my heart on anything until the end of July or August, when I know what the raffle situation is.” She says that raffling her house to raise money has been keeping her busy over lockdown. “I was bored s**tless. During lockdown, I really wanted a project, Claire said. “You have to be on social media all the time, posting stories, you have to keep the house clean, posting pictures, answering the phone.” And she isn’t alone. Raffling houses online has become a new fad with tickets being sold for a chance to win houses across the country. Claire was first inspired by a house raffled off in Waterford. Since then there have been houses raffled in Kilkenny, Wexford and one currently being raffled in Donegal. While some people are selling their homes via raffle in a bid to make a profit, others like Claire are donating proceeds to charity. “The family in Donegal are doing it for Beaumont , Claire said. Nobody  is doing it for animals though.” The ISPCA, who have been appealing for funding throughout the pandemic, are in full support of Claire’s venture. ISPCA Head of Fundraising Lylah OaposBeirne has said that “generous donations from kindhearted animal lovers like Claire are critical to ensuring our services can continue.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore Onproperty newsCharitiesHospitalsLoveMarriageStately homesWedding dayTwinsAnimals"},{"url":null,"title":"zara tindall shares details sweet","story":"NewsZara Tindall shares details of sweet relationship with Queen as she turns The Queens granddaughter rarely offers glimpses into her relationship with Her Majesty, but revealed in an interview how she is usually always in her good books and how her grandmother has offered much-needed support during dficult timesmirrorShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyReporter:,  MAY NewsThe Queen and Zara Phillips, pictured at Cheltenham Races, share a passion for horses \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Queenaposs granddaughter rarely offers glimpses into her relationship with Her Majesty, but revealed in an interview how she is usually always in her good books. Zara said she often gets the good look from the Queen, as opposed to a sterner look reserved for other members of the royal family perhaps. She said: I always get the good look. We are okay, I think we are alright. But Zara said as a child she may have got a firmer look from the Queenshe pushed her look too far, adding: Probably when we were much younger, but not recently, definitely not.  And when Zara and husband Mike Tindall sadly suffered a miscarriage in , they told how the Queen offered much-needed comfort and support. Mike, former England rugby pro, said during the traditional Christmas Day Sandringham service that year, the Queen stayed with Zara and Mike for a private service. He told the House of Rugby podcast in : Two years ago, she wasnapost feeling very well and so she didnapost go to church and weaposd obviously been what weaposd been through with our pregnancy that we lost, so we did our own little private one - just as a three.  One royal expert claims Zara and the Queen actually have a tighter relationship compared to other grandchildren. Ingrid Seward, Editor-in-Chief of Majesty Magazine, told the Sun the Queen enjoys the company of Zara and Mike as they seem more normal than the Cambridges. She said: The Queen has always adored Zara and is so proud of her riding sucess. They have a lot in common as they talk horses and the Queen has invested in several horses for her.

Princes William and Harry, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Zara Tindall can always be seen chatting at official royal events and enjoying private jokes together. But there was one rather cheeky comment Zara was caught making to Harry that might have caused a bit of awkwardness behind the scenes. While weaposre sure it was just a bit of fun, the Queenaposs granddaughteraposs quiet words about Eugenieaposs royal wedding could have got her into trouble with her more-senior cousin.  Harry and Zara and their partners Meghan Markle and Mike Tindall had some of the best seats in the house when Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank in October  at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor. However as Zara took her seat she made a passing comment to Harry which could have caused some upset. She was seen leaning back to say a few words to Harry about his own wedding to Meghan, which had taken place a few months before. According to a lip reader, she told the prince: Itaposs very quiet compared to the screaming at your wedding.  In response, he asked: Mine  Eugenie and Jack picked the same wedding venue as the Sussexes for their special day, but they were very dferent occasions. Despite Harry being more senior than his younger cousin, Eugenie actually had more guests, which Prince Andrew said was because his daughter has so many friends. Both guestlists were filled with celebrity guests, with George and Amal Clooney, Oprah Winfrey and the Beckhams joining the royals for the Sussexesapos big day.  Meanwhile, Ellie Goulding, Cara DeLevigne, Demi Moore, and Naomi Campbell were at Eugenieaposs.Eugenie was reportedly upset at her wedding when Meghan used the occasion to tell members of the family she was pregnant. The couple told the world they were expecting their first child on the eve of their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, but shared the happy news with close family at the evening reception. In their book Royals at War, investigative journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett claim Meghan made the decision to tell people - and it didnapost go down well with Harry. They claim that it left the Duke of Sussex embarrassed, and Princess Eugenie and her mum Sarah Ferguson furious.

For instance, we recently learned that our iPhones keep track of all the places we visit - logging when we went and how long we were there for.And now one social media user has claimed that our Apple phones have also been taking photos of us every few seconds. In a viral TikTok video, a woman shares her conspiracy theory, filming her phone with an infrared lens, which shows a flash going off every five seconds. And while it does look like itaposs taking pictures, experts have explained thataposs not actually the case.  According to a number of people in the comments, the phone is actually scanning to seeyou are looking directly at the screen - and it only occurs on iPhones that have the Face ID feature. Itaposs whataposs known as an Attention-Aware feature, meaning that the phone will check whether youaposre paying attention to the screen, before dimming the display, lowering the volume of some alerts or expanding a notication. Responding to @itsconspiracyseriously and @briethomasons video, people compared the feature to the way Amazonaposs Alexa devices are always listening out for the aposAlexaapos command. One person said: Of course it doesyou have Face ID set up. Itaposs like Alexa or Google Home. Constantly listening for the Hey Google or Hey Alexa. Same concept. Another said: The phone is not taking pictures, itaposs only seeingyou are looking at the phone so it wonapost lock while you are looking at it. You can deactivate that. Others claimed to have seen the flashes on their baby monitor and been confused as to what they were. If youaposre not keen on the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face, you can disable the feature in settings. You simply go to Face ID  Passcode, enter your passcode and then scroll down to attention. Here you have two options you can deactivate - Require Attention for Face ID and Attention-Aware Features. The first feature says: TrueDepth camera will provide an additional level of security by verying that you are looking at iPhone before unlocking. Some sunglasses may block attention detection. The second, attention-aware reads: iPhone will check for attention before dimming the display, expanding a notication when locked or lowering the volume of some alerts.

China has followed the United States to land on Mars, reported state media, with the key moment when it comes in to land due to the lack of control on the vehicle. The Tianwen- spacecraft landed on a site on the Southern Utopia Plain, leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time, Xinhua said. Following more than six months of travel, safely landing on Mars is a complicated task where there is no human intervention possible.  The official Chinese Space News said the landing process consisted of nine minutes of terror as the module decelerates and then slowly descends. The vehicle used a combination of a protective capsule, a parachute and a rocket  to make the descent. The touchdown is a signicant achievement with only the Americans previously having been able to land on Mars.  A rover, named Zhurong, will now survey the landing site before departing from its  to conduct inspections. It has six scientic instruments including a high-resolution topography camera. The rover will study the planetaposs surface soil and atmosphere. Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient le, including any sub-surface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar. Tianwen-, or Questions to Heaven, after a Chinese poem written two millennia ago, is Chinaaposs first independent mission to Mars. A probe co-launched with Russia in  failed to leave the Earthaposs orbit.  The five-tonne spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year, launched by the powerful Long March  rocket. Tianwen- reached the Red Planet in February and since then it had been looking for a spot to land where it was as flat as possible without craters or boulders.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeLike other observers and academics, I used to think the two-state solution was the most effective means for Israel-Palestine peace. That plan is dead now. A one-state solution has become a reality with equal rights for Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs. What has led to the collapse of the two-state plan  First, since the Six-Day War of June  Israel’s occupation and control of Palestinian land and le has become deeply entrenched. More than half a million Jewish settlers and counting dominate the hills and fertile land in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Far from independent, the Palestinian authority led by Mahmoud Abbas s mainly as a contractual security coordinator with the Israeli military occupation. Second, after decades of international and Israel human rights organizations warning that Israel’s control of Palestinian le might lead to apartheid, the “threshold” has now been crossed, according to a new, well-documented report, by Human Rights Watch. Indeed, one of the more startling new findings in the HRW report is that even the Palestinians living in Israel are subjected to a form of apartheid rule.  The HRW report asserts that nearly seven million Palestinians in the occupied territories and within Israel itself face collective persecution under an apartheid system. Third, Donald Trump’s decision to unilaterally and illegally gt the remaining bit of historical Palestine to Benjamin Netanyahu not only destroyed the framework of a two-state solution but has also made the one-state solution or a bi-national state with citizenship and equal rights for both communities the only option available to advance a just and lasting resolution to this conflict. Yes, the international community still supports a two-state plan, international law favours two states, and most Israelis oppose a one-state solution and demand a Jewish state.  Not only that but the two main Palestinian partiesoppose a one-state solution. But they have more to gain than to lose in accepting a one-state plan. So instead of paying lip service to the fancul notion of a two-state solution, the international community, including the UK, should support a bi-national or a federaldemocratic state with equal rights for all citizens.  As long as the US supports Israel, unconditionally, Israel has no incentive to change there is room here for the UK and the EU to play a more constructive role.Fawaz Gerges is a professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics.

Portugal confirmed that it will reopen its borders to tourists from the UK with negative PCR tests next week. The country has ignored EU guidance to ban tourists from non-bloc countries from visiting until at least next month. And UK holiday firms have ­experienced huge demand. Paul Charles, chief executive of The PC Agency, said: “Well done to Portugal for making it happen. We need to see a wider green list from June.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The news was greeted with delight in the Algarve, where more than  UK flights are due to land on Monday, with the local temperature set to hit C. Saturday, FA Cup Final day, is usually frantic at O’Daly’s pub in Albufeira but only a handful of expats will be sipping pints. Not that it bothers owner Ricardo Pimpao, , who knows ­tourists are on their way.  “We’re calling it Manic Monday,” he said. “We’ve waited a long time for it. It would have been nice to have them for the football but we can wait another couple of days. “We’re opening at am and want people to come straight from the airport for a pint.”  Ricardo and co-owner Miguel Oliviera took over the Irish pub last October but have hardly been open. “It has been very dficult,” said Ricardo. “Now we are waiting with our fingers crossed that the Brits arrive next week. We first heard it on the news and we were cheering.” Albufeira is the party capital of the Algarve but it has been a ghost town for many months.  Now Joao Fernandes, the region’s tourism president, has declared: “We’re ready and waiting.” He told British holidaymakers: “The sun is shining, the beaches are looking beautul and the golf courses are manicured. Our bars and restaurants are ready to serve you with the freshest seafood and excellent Portuguese wine.  “We have missed our British friends. They make up about % of our visitors so they were greatly missed. “We have all the necessary health and safety measures in place, so visitors don’t need to worry.” Beach assistants will help keep people two metres apart and there is no lack of signage.  Mr Fernandes said: “The main thing is for people to enjoy the sunshine, some good food and family time after a long winter of restrictions.” Everywhere you look in ­Albufeira, business owners are sprucing up their venues. Beer delivery trucks squeeze through the Old Town’s streets and halt traffic on the famous party strip.  Carlos and Eduarda Fernandes run souvenir shop Sol de Barro close to the sandy beach but almost went bust during lockdown. “There’s nobody here to buy anything,” said Carlos, . “Yesterday we didn’t sell a thing all day.” He is also excited about the British. “We have waited a long time. It’s the families we want to see most.  It has been sad to see Albufeira all closed but I’m smiling because it feels like Covid is ending.” Cathy Jump, landlady of Charlies Bar, said the past few months had been “brutal”. She is praying for British tourists to arrive in time for the peak holiday season.  “Monday is going to be emotional when I see those first Brits walk through the doors,” she said. “It’s been awful. We had a few ­tourists last summer but then none. “We’ve only been allowed to open for the past two weeks between am and pm. There’s apparently a meeting being held this weekend to decidethose hours can be extended.

A few have already said they are flying over asap.” Down the coast, business owners in Praia da Luz are also preparing. Hans Neauwburg, owner of ZaZu and Boaty’s restaurants, said: “We have reservations for next week and can’t wait to see all our British friends.” Katy Bauval, of the Vila Vita Parc hotel in Porches, said it had been “absolute madness” in terms of ­bookings from the UK. Pestana, Portugal’s largest hotel chain, also confirmed a “very ­substantial increase” in bookings. Another big draw in the area is golf and the Dom Pedro Pinhal golf course in Vilamoura is opening on Monday, with greens-keepers including Jose Borges working round the clock.

Sources told the Daily Mirror on Friday the toll of Hamas fighters may run into several hundred with one saying: “I believe it may have been at least  or more fighters.” The devastating and brutal deception was launched by the Israeli Defence Force tweeting they were attacking from the ground and air.

The UN estimates that , Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes for safety as the assault from Israel goes on, with the militant group firing thousands of rockets at Israeli cities.Eight people have been killed in Israel, authorities say, including a soldier and two children.US and Arab diplomats are continuing to seek an end to the violence as the situation continues to spiral, claiming the lives of  children so far according to Palestinian medical officials. Thousands of Palestinian families have taken shelter in UN run schools in northern Gaza. At least four people were killed in one of several airstrikes in northern Gaza, said Palestinian officials, while residents said Israeli naval boats had fired shells from the Mediterranean.  Israeli planes destroyed a mosque, according to the Palestinian religious affairs ministry.Sirens sounded in two major southern Israeli cities warning of incoming fire from Gaza with Hamas claiming responsibility for launching rockets. With no sign of an end to the fighting, Palestinians reported  killed in the occupied West Bank amid clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces.  Hamas said a woman and a boy were among the four people killed in an Israeli air strike that hit a home belonging to the Abu Hattab family in Gaza Cityaposs Beach refugee camp.The Israeli army has not yet commented on the strike.Among eight dead in Israel were a soldier patrolling the Gaza border and six civilians, including two children, Israeli authorities said.  The UN Security Council is due to discuss the deepening crisis on Sunday.Israel launched day-long attacks on Friday to destroy what it said were several miles of tunnels, launch sites and weapons manufacturing warehouses used by the militants in an effort to halt the rocket attacks. Across central and southern Israel, from small towns bordering Gaza to metropolitan Tel Aviv and southern Beersheba, people have adjusted to sirens wailing, radio and TV broadcast interruptions and the beeps of cellphones bearing red alerts that send them rushing for cover.  Cross-border hostilities between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza have been accompanied by violence in mixed communities of Jews and Arabs in Israel.Synagogues have been attacked and street fights have broken out, prompting Israelaposs president to warn of civil war. Egypt was leading regional efforts for a ceasefire with Cairo leaning on Hamas and others, including the United States, trying to reach an agreement with Israel.  The foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan discussed efforts to end the Gaza confrontation and to prevent provocations in Jerusalem, Egyptaposs foreign ministry said. The talks have taken a real and serious path on Friday, a Palestinian official said. The mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations are stepping up their contacts with all sides in a bid to restore calm, but a deal hasnapost yet been reached.  Hamas launched the rocket attacks on Monday, in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near al-Aqsa Mosque, Islamaposs third holiest site, in East Jerusalem. The Israeli military said more than , rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel since the start of the conflict, around half of them intercepted by missile defence system and  falling into the Gaza Strip.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHamasIsraelPalestinian National Authority"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/20092903-586x372.jpg ","title":"dundee boss james mcpake annoyed by questions over charlie adam absence and insists decision to take things slow with his captain is paying off","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remJames McPake says he was annoyed by constant questions over the absence of Dundee captain Charlie Adam earlier this season.The Dark Blues skipper had to be patient on hisfrom Covid- and take a place on the bench as the team’s form took off.At Dunfermline, despite the club searching for a winner, Adam was an unused sub and rumours began of a fall-out between the player and manager.The Dens boss brought up that rumour personally in a press conference to address the issue.Adam admits he did search out reasons for his absence from the side from McPake at the time.Speaking to the Athletic, he said: “Dundee is a small city and I heard someone askwe had a falling-out but we had a conversation like a manager and player should.“I went to see him when I wasn’t playing to have an explanation and I got one. That’s how it should be.“There is a trust and honesty from the manager and I have a great relationship with him. We both want what’s best for Dundee.”After a man of the match display for Adam in the crucial first leg of their play-off semi-final against Raith Rovers, McPake says the decision to take things slow with his key man is paying off.Returning to the starting XI in recent weeks, the -times capped Scotland international led his side to key wins over Raith and Queen of the South to secure second place.He outdid himself, however, with two superb assists for Jordan McGhee in Kirkcaldy on Wednesday night before sending Max Anderson away to lay on a third goal for Osman Sow.It was a performance McPake says makes him proud to be Adam’s manager.“Questions have been asked about why he wasn’t in the team and it annoyed me,” the Dundee boss said.“You’ve got to look at the time he’s had since he came back up the road.“You could see his celebration when the third goal went in– this club means the world to him.➡️ https:t.co tkIwnm pic oyXczNdhmdash Dundee Football ClubMay , “Unfortunately he lost a parent and then had a really bad spell with Covid.“There were questions at Inverness about why he wasn’t on from the start in that game. He was working up to a level and I think we saw that on Wednesday.“I think it was the right decision.

Our family, friends and the majority of our team are all here.#What is important to me is that Six°North continues its journey without losing its soul, and continues to offer opportunity and reward to those that have been committed to our business over the last eight years.#After over twelve months of reflection, it’s obvious to me that the current business structure cannot deliver this.#To achieve this we must take a small step back, consolidate our business in the short term, and be in as strong a position as possible as markets and opportunities open up again post-Covid.#We have made the dficult, and sometimes a seemingly impossible decision, to refocus on our efforts and operations in the North East.#This means we intend to build on what we have created in Stonehaven, Aberdeen, Laurencekirk, and Dundee. It also means saying goodbye to Six°North Edinburgh and Six°North Glasgow.#Six Degree North#s first bar was opened on Littlejohn Street in Aberdeen in June , two months after they first started out next door to the Marine Hotel in Stonehaven.They then moved to larger brewery premises in Laurencekirk in October , where they expanded their brewing capacity.A second bar was opened on Dumbarton Road in Glasgow in March , before a third was opened on Howe Street in Edinburgh five months later.Their last premises was unveiled in December  on Union Street in Dundee.The future is still bright for the brewery as they aim to consolidate their business across the north-east of Scotland.Their premises in Glasgow has been taken over by another bar but continue to serve Six Degrees North, while their Edinburgh home has yet to find new owners.Mr Lindsay spoke about his #great love# for both of the venues, their customers, staff, and communities surrounding them.He added: #We have many beers yet to brew, many drinkers yet to meet and some wonderfully exciting opportunities to develop.#We have an ability to create erse products and services within the brewing, hospitality, and tourism sector, but this will not be best realised for us by operating venues from afar.#It is the end for our central belt venue adventure, we are not ing home with our tail between our legs, but proud of what we brought, when we brought it, the staff that helped us, and the customers that came through the door.#We will be forever grateful and honoured to have served these people and to have been part of their communities.#Six°North may be ing home, but we are very much looking forward to writing the next stage of our adventure and continuing to catch up with our friends further afield.#The brewery will continue to supply its beers across the whole of Scotland and the UK.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

Bennachie ft high.#Showing people what you can achieve despite obstacles in le is one of his reasons for taking on this challenge. He suffered a heart attack in  which resulted in open heart surgery and a triple bypass operation and was diagnosed with leukemia in .On his Total Giving page, Mr McArthur said: #So far, fingers crossed, I am fighting fit and up for a challenge.#Following his day  climb, he said: #It#s going fine so far. It#s getting quite tough but I#ll be able to do it all as long as my knees don#t give out.#I#m quite fit, but I was a bit worried because I hadn#t done more than two consecutive trial runs.#I#m just taking it one day at a time. That#s my strategy, my goal each day is to just get another climb out the way.#Although it would be nicethe weather was better.#Mr McArthur has continued to climb through snow, sleet and hail stones and at times cannot see more than a few feet ahead. He has completed some of the climbs solo while friends have joined him for others.He added: #I#ve had some friends climb with me which has been really nice, it#s good to have someone to talk to.#Mr McArthur is raising funds for GEF to celebrate his th birthday this year. He has already received donations of more than £, and hopes to raise lots more for the charity.He said: #I hope my determination can persuade you to sponsor my effort throughout May and give some more Kenyan children the chances in le they so richly deserve.#GEF is a Scottish charity which supports disadvantaged children in Kenya through shelter, education, sustainable food solutions and counselling.He continued: #I have run the Moneymusk Boules Masters for the past eight or nine years and have managed to raise a fair bit of money for dferent charities. We have  players wearing fancy dress in the square and it is always a nice day out for everyone.#Some of the money raised from the tournament in  was supposed to go to GEF, but when it was cancelled I promised I would raise money in . When Covid stopped that too, I decided I had to do something myself.#When I was coming up with this crazy scheme the travel restrictions were still in place, so I had to find something I could do within a five mile radius. I was sitting looking at Mither Tap from my window and that#s when I created this monster of a challenge for myself.#For his day eight climb, Mr McArthur was joined by his friend Ben Riddell, personal trainer at The Le Coach, who has been working with him for the past three years.Mr Riddell said: #I first met Neil after his heart surgery when he came to seethe gym would be suitable for him. He has progressed so much with his fitness and we#ve now developed a friendship.#He came to me a couple months ago with this idea to climb Bennachie every day in May and askedI thought he could do it. I said yes, but that he had to prep and get into the right mindset.#We came up with a plan for going up and worked out a schedule so he could get to the very top every day.#I climbed up with him on Saturday morning which was an absolute pleasure. He is an inspiration to me and many others and it#s been a privilege to train him and help him back to health over the past three years.#The -year-old said Mr Riddell was #instrumental# in his recovery and in his preparations for this challenge.He added: #Open heart surgery is very debilitating.

Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches.

Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating.

As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

The Tories remain the second force in Scottish politics, a long way ahead of theLabour party.The verdict of the Scottish people could not have been clearer. We are a ided country, split more or less evenly between nationalists and unionists. To remain so ided appears, for the time being at least, to be our collective settled will.And yet. The clamour for a repeat referendum on independence started before even all the votes were counted, and the noise will only intensy as the weeks unfold. The UK Government is not interested and, instead of talking about mandates and independence and section  orders and all, is trying none too subtly to remain focused on building our recovery from the pandemic and the havoc it has wreaked.:How the Tories became unlikely working class heroes, by Stuart WaitonThis is smart politics. They would be as foolish indefinitely to rule out any repeat referendum as the SNP would be to rush into it. Politicians who say there cannot be another shot at independence for half a century are as likely to be punished by the voters as politicians who say it must all happen by the end of the autumn. What Scots want, as focus group after focus group has shown, is the prospect of a second referendum on the horizon ndash but no closer than that, thank you very much. Even the most enthusiastic Yes voters understand that we have to recover from Covid first.But, evennow is not the time, it does not follow that all the UK Government should do is to sit back and hope that the clock does not tick too fast.There are those who counsel that unionists should just stop talking about it. Let the SNP talk about itthey want to ndash its their project, after all. We unionists, on the other hand, should get on with fixing the backlog in the NHS, with addressing the year of lost schooling, and with the rising tide of unemployment that, one fears, has been delayed rather than reversed by the Treasuryrsquos highly successful furlough scheme.I hear the force of that argument, but I take a dferent view. I think governments can do more than one thing at a time. Our focus should be on the recovery but, at the same time, we do need to start having a more serious conversation about independence than we have had until now. Again, this is what focus groups will tell you.WestminsterA lot of Scots are indy-curious. Itrsquos an interesting and potentially attractive idea, but they want to know much more about it.

If one part of the UK wishes to withdraw, it has been our constitutional understanding that the other parts will not stand in the way. We are not Spain, held together by force of law. But the consent that holds us together needs to be informed consent. And we know that there are certain key, critical issues that will have to be addressed before we can really understand what we are being asked by the question ldquoshould Scotland be an independent country Top of the list, now as ever, is currency.

So lets hear the visionNow is the time for these questions to come to the fore. The UK Government should start asking them. Ministers should perhaps even commission some trusted independent experts to think about answering them ndash the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for example  Select committees could open inquiries into these matters, perhaps even joint committees of MPs and MSPs combined  You know, we could even have a citizensrsquo assembly on these topics.It matters less what the process is. It matters more that,Scots are to be asked the independence question again, whether during the course of this parliamentary session or not, we have answers we can trust on the core issues that will be facing us.

But strict physical distancing measures of one metre will apply which, along with other robust restrictions like the rule of no more than six from three households, no standing at the bar, table service, and mask wearing when queuing will undoubtedly restrict sales. It will also mean that for many operators, especially those with no outdoor areas to take up the slack, therersquos no point in opening as they wonrsquot be viable.Its a ludicrous situation made all the more preposterous when you think that the same number of people from the same number of households can meet at a palrsquos house for a proper sesh, a house partyyou like, before going out, and after bells, without having to mask up, sanitise and physically distance.Then there is the strict .pm curfew which, along with the two-hour booking window, has enraged operators.

It looks like the UK announcement means whatever is set up will take a four-nations approach, or at least there will be consultation across governments to see how viable that is.This announcement is welcome but overdue, as groups including the Covid- Bereaved Families For Justice group have been calling for an inquiry since last July.Public inquiries take time to set up and then to gather evidence and report. This process is likely to take years rather than months. Findings will help longer term planning but will not change much,anything, soon.:Covid Glasgow: Spike in the city needs a robust response, says Prof Linda BauldIn the meantime we are beginning to see other review mechanisms be established internationally that are already aiming to learn lessons from recent months. Their findings should help us here in Scotland to try and chart a steady course in the short term and also point to issues that need examined in our own inquiries.The first formal review of the global response to Covid- was published this week. This was a report from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response . It was convened in September  and made up of  members from dferent countries, co-chaired by Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia. The  reviewed a range of evidence and spoke to many experts and dferent groups. They reflected on the fact that the pandemic has been the worst health, social and economic crisis in living memory, with  million people infected and over three million deaths up to the end of April , although this is likely an underestimate.What the IPPPR report makes clear is that the pandemic was preventable, and argues that there hasnrsquot been sufficient learning from previous infectious disease epidemics like Ebola and SARS. While experts have mapped out how to plan for, prevent, or at least mitigate the impact of these crises, their recommendations have not been taken seriously enough.The report has a strong focus on the global level but also makes recommendations for countries, how they can contribute internationally, and what they need to do within their own borders. This has implications for Scotland and indeed how any enquiry is conducted here or at UK level.The report is an example of the benefits of conducting an inquiry early, because some of its recommendations need to be implemented now to accelerate recovery and prevent more deaths globally. It also includes longer term recommendations. Immediate priorities are around vaccines.The report recommends that high income countries like the UK that have already secured enough vaccines to protect their own populations should, while still delivering jags into arms domestically, provide low and middle income countries with at least one billion vaccine doses by the autumn of this year, with more to follow in .The mechanism for this is Covax, the Covid- vaccines global access facility which the UK joined in September last year. They also recommend waiving intellectual property rights on vaccinesto allow more countries to manufacture vaccines themselves.:Westminster sketch: Boris Johnson calms down about Scotland and promises Duchy courage from GoveLooking ahead, IPPPR also sets out what needs to change in global health governance. They call for more funding for the World Health Organisation from inidual countries, rather than forcing the WHO to rely on big philanthropic organisations. Plus they ask the United Nations to set up a global threats council to coordinate international and national pandemic preparedness, and call for a new international pandemic financing facility.The  praises some countries for their response to Covid- and roundly criticises others, without naming names. Some countries suffered from poor leadership and slow and insufficient action, downplayed risks and didnrsquot take sufficient account of evidence on whatto do.Looking ahead, they point to some key lessons. The first is the need for strong leadership and coordination ndash a lsquowhole of governmentrsquo response to continue to address Covid-. Investing in preparation now for future crises with access to rapid and accurate data and knowing who is accountable for which actions. Having national plans in place for supplies , diagnostics, medicines and vaccines. Plus, setting aside funds for preparation that can be quickly accessed to deal with outbreaks or future threats. These issues will undoubtedly come up in an inquiry into the pandemic here in Scotland and across the UK.There is a final point from this report that is worth emphasising. It isnrsquot enough for international or national authorities to simply instruct people how to behave when a crisis hits. Itrsquos much more effectivepeople can get involved, be listened to and feel they have a stake in a collective response.As we look ahead to a public inquiry on Covid-, the most important voices will be those of the people of Scotland. Not just the families who have lost loved ones but also those working on the front line, and those affected by the measures taken to address the pandemic.

Good judgment and circumstance can mean that they survive for many years but, usually, the longer the same party stays in power, the harder things get.Events happen and problems multiply, which, like chained balls, progressively weigh the incumbents down. Familiarity begins to breed contempt with disgruntled voters while political enemies increase, particularly on the governing partyrsquos benches and especially among those colleagues sacked or overlooked.

He urged the Tories to change or face annihilation. They did change they changed him.His successor, Michael Howard, failed to make a breakthrough in the  election but saw Mr Blairrsquos majority fall sharply, by  to , and the Tories, three-time losers, reached out for change and found the fresh-faced, relatively unknown liberal Conservative David Cameron.Meanwhile in Downing Street, an impatient Gordon Brown finally prised out Mr Blair, got the job he felt he should have had in  but lost the election in .As Mr Cameron and countless party leaders have found reinvention is a tortuous but essential process of democratic politics it is now what Sir Keir and his colleagues have to undertakethey are to stand any chance of taking power at Westminster in   and prevent a fth Conservative government.Following last weekrsquos Super Thursday elections, when Labour made some gains, most notably in the English mayoral contests, but more prominently lost the Hartlepool by-election and hundreds of council seats to the Tories, the party leader compounded the overall poor performance by first ldquoscapegoating Angela Rayner and then over-compensating for his failure to sack his deputy by showering her with an abundance of new positions from shadow first secretary of state, and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

It cannot afford to engage in old Left-Right battles of the past that crippled the party during the s.Mr Blair, who unlike Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to not one but three consecutive General Election victories, said what Labour now needed was ldquototal deconstruction and reconstruction nothing less will do.Interestingly, he noted: ldquoAt present, Labour expresses perfectly the progressive dilemma: Corbyn was radical but not sensible Keir seems sensible but not radical.

Mr Macintosh and others should currently be rejoicing that the Westminster ldquofirst past the post system was not used, as the result would have been SNP , Conservative , LibDems , Labour .It is high time the Scottish Conservatives played by the rules and recognised the electoral success achieved by the SNP and the Greens. The Tories were elected by only .% of the UK vote at the  General Electionwhich took us out of the EU. In the Holyrood election, Mr Mackintosh says .% cast votes for the Union, therefore meaning .% of the votes were cast for independence. This is an increase of .% over what Mr Johnson achieved.The way ahead is not going to be resolved by such actions but by mature debate. Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader, whilst not a supporter of independence is demonstrating such maturity. Time for the Scottish Conservatives and LibDems to behave themselves and do likewise.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.ALL DEFECTORS SHOULD STAND DOWNNEIL Mackay raises an interesting pointbut his point goes beyond just those defecting from the SNP.When iniduals are elected to represent a party from whom they depart, for whatever reason, they are breaching an agreement with those who voted them into office. In all of these circumstances the iniduals should require to resign their seat and a by-election held. This would ensure that the democratic position of electors is held sacrosanct.Bill Eadie, Gfnock.AWKWARD QUESTIONS GO UNANSWEREDI AM a voter in Airdrie and Shotts where there has been a by-election campaign. A leaflet from the SNP candidate came through my letterbox. It invited me to get in contact and so on Monday, May  I sent a question by email. There was no reply so I chased up a response with further emails on Wednesday, May  and Monday, May . I have still heard nothing.Perhaps only sycophantic questions are permitted or only ones that SNP staff approve of. Or perhaps the SNP has been dominant in Scottish politics for so long that voters are simply taken for granted. It may be that horrible entitled arrogance that the SNPused to accuse other political parties of, before becoming the establishment itself.My question was quite simple. I am keen to see ethics prevail in politics. Why should I compromise my principles by voting for a candidate whose party leader was found to have misled the Scottish Parliament  I would feel very uncomfortable voting for someone guilty of serious deceit. There may be many responses to this, but I am left none the wiser.I really wish candidates wouldnt ask us voters to get in touch when they have no interest in our views.David Kennedy, Airdrie.THE GLOOM OF A NEW DAWNTHE new intake at Holyrood has just started and already the problems are piling up: huge potential taxpayers bills and an essential ferry service that is not working, especially at the start of the SNPs \"staycation\" drive .

Nothing happened despite the composition of the previous Holyrood cohort being pro-independence. What chance now of a slippage of this vote occurring yet again Does the SNP not realise that its credibility to deliver what it says is fading rapidly, be that new ferries or new constitutional wrangles  Meantime the bills pile up and the money gets tighter. Huge unaffordable pay increases for some and \"free\" items for others will have to mean pain for most of the rest. Welcome to a new dawn of SNP mismanagement for the next five years.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.WE NEED CLEAR, CONCISE PLANSIAN Blackford has quite rightly put Westminster \"on notice\" over the desire of Scots to hold a referendum . However, I fear that he is missing the point, in that many Scots were only voting to push for that event alone, and not a vote for independence.The SNP needs to have a clear, concise and robust plan laid out in front of the electorate, prior to any referendum, as to how independence is going to operate and be funded. I have this nagging doubt in my mind, thata referendum goes against the nationalist movement, they will immediately still behave like a dog with a bone, and never let go. Discussions must be arranged, so that vitally important and mutually agreed terms on the operation of a referendum, and its final result, can be set up.George Dale, Beith.IT WONT BE WORTH ITDURING the election, one broadcaster described Andrew Wilson, author of the now ldquoout of date Sustainable Growth Commission, as ldquothe brains behind the SNP. On at least two occasions on the run-up to the election Mr Wilson stated that independence ldquowill not be easy but will be worth it. The majority of Scots whose votes outnumbered those of the SNP and Greens are earnestly waiting for evidence that the massive disruption of separation will be worth it.Once the people of Scotland are made aware of what is in store with SNP proposals, I doubt very muchthey will agree that it will be worth it. The SNP also has to explain what ldquowill not be easy. Since , Nicola Sturgeon has failed to offer any analysis or research into the economic implications of independence. Her reluctance to push for another referendum is ample evidence that she is not convinced a separate Scotland \"will be worth it. The majority already know this.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.A REMAINER NO MORESCOTLAND already had full access to EU markets when we were members of the EU but only did  per cent of trade, so why does the SNP think that by rejoining the EU it would be able to increase it  We would also be up against and competing with the UK, have border controls and an even more remote \"union\" with a  million population .

In regards to food supply issues, it could be used as an effective tool to predict what will happen in areas hit by climate change by showing the effects of growing dferent crops and using dferent techniques.As well as improving the resilience of crops, it could also help reduce pesticide use ndash improving the impact on the environment as well as increasing yields. Carbon emissions could also be reduced by accurately modelling how dferent crops could be grown effectively in dferent places so they are harvested nearer local markets, decreasing the need for transport.This digital twin would be a ldquogame-changer according to Jaime Reed, CGIrsquos vice president of space data s and applications in the UK. ldquoPeople have dreamed of modelling these really big, tricky problems for years and now, because of the computing power that is available, we are finally on the verge of being able to do it which is exciting, he said.ldquoWe hear a lot of negative things about companies using data for advertising and so on but we can take a lot of that technology and use it to make tangible dferences to peoplersquos lives.He said CGIrsquos digital twin was intended to be a proof of concept, to see whether it could be done. ldquoItrsquos a really good idea but it is a very big challenge, he said.ldquoNothing like this has ever been done before other than weather forecasting, which has taken  years using computers to get to where we are today. Everybody thinks it is feasible but we need to prove it so this project is really on that cutting edge to show it is possible.CGI will build the precursor using its digital data  technology incorporating Articial Intelligencetechniques. A model integration will bring together multiple data sets, including socio-economic and physical measurements to demonstrate how powerful these advanced technologies can be for solving todayrsquos most pressing challenges.The precursor will be developed by an industrial and scientic team including Oxford University Innovation, Trillium and IIASA. A wide ranging stakeholder group of scientists and users will support the precursor to ensure it is truly state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose and will build momentum towards ground-breaking digital innovation in Europe.Reed said it took ldquoa lot of hard work to win the project but there is now a first class team working on it, including stakeholders who could provide valuable input on the kind of problems they would like solved.ldquoThe aim is to build something that is useful, so that is why we need to have the stakeholders guiding us, he said. ldquoThere is a strong academic link there as well so it is really about the community coming together to deliver a game changer.CGI has, in fact, been delivering complex, mission-critical space software systems for clients across Europe, Asia and North America supporting satellite navigation, communications and operations, to space enabled applications for over  years.Reed said: ldquoThis builds on all the heritage we have in this area as we have been doing this kind of thing for quite a long time.The prototype will use satellite data that monitors crops and combines it with data on weather, climate and population movement and growth to produce holistic modelling.An example of how it would work would be to provide predictions of what will happen as a result of the UK changing its way of managing crops now that it has left the EU.ldquoThe aim is now to improve bioersity which is a big policy change but nobody really knows what is going to happen because there are no integrated simulation systems at present, Reed said. Modelling of crop production in climate stressed areas would be of interest to aid agencies, the World Bank and the UN, he pointed out.ldquoOne of the problems at the moment is that it is quite hard to evaluate what the solutions are because everything is done quite experimentally, said Reed.The Digital Twin Earth would be able to run through dferent scenarios to see what would work best in order to make more informed decisions on food production.Gordon Campbell at ESA said: lsquolsquoThis is an extremely challenging development activity, linking erse analysis capabilities to provide a step change in the information available to decision makers in domains such as food security, protecting ecosystems and bioersity, planning energy production and managing resource utilisation within the framework of the European Green Deal. The range of competencies within the team is well suited to addressing this challenge and developing a prototype system to enable target stakeholders to explore the opportunities afforded by these new analysis tools.Shaun Stretton, Senior Vice President for UK  Australia Space Control and Information Solutions at CGI added: ldquoWe are excited to be part of the ESA Digital Twin Earth programme which will enable the scientic community to better understand the environmental changes impacting our global food supply. This project builds on our ongoing support to the European Space Agency and Thematic Exploitation Platforms.------------------------------------------------------High hopes of creating a better worldData gathering advances may not only assist with global food shortages but also improve climate change predictionsACCURATE data will be essential to enable the Digital Twin Earth to produce valid and precise modelling of the results of climate change and weather patterns on food production.Much of this data will be gleaned from the satellites that orbit the planet, monitoring its climate and weather.These observations could now be made much more accurate by a new project which also involves CGI.Called TRUTHS, it is a UK-led mission, designed to improve Earth observation data in order to drive improved climate change modelling.It is intended to increase the ability for climate benchmarking and satellite cross-calibration, enabling a metrology laboratory in space as well as providing measurements of the solar spectrum to address scientic questions.It is being led by Airbus in the UK and involves the UK Space Agencyand other ESA member states and will be delivered by the European Space Agencyto enable in-flight calibration of Earth Observationsatellites.If successful, it will help deliver improved confidence in Earth observation data gathered from space and the critical forecasts provided by this data.CGIrsquos role is to define the Payload Data Ground Systemfor the Traceable Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studiessatellite.ldquoAccuracy of data is vital in helping scientists understand the impact of climate change and we are proud to be supporting this mission with our strong heritage of ground segment control and space data exploitation, said Shaun Stretton, Senior Vice President for UK  Australia Space Control and Information Solutions at CGI."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-please-mr-postman","story":"WITH the swish and swagger of the Brit Awards taking place a few days ago, our readers may be wondering why the Diary doesnrsquot have its own prize-giving ceremony.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800606.jpg--.jpg?1620905531000\n","title":"beth backs foster fortnight with her deeds and words","story":"BALLYMENA Councillor Beth Adger can speak with some authority on the topic of fostering.Having fostered nearly  youngsters over two decades, she was the ideal person to voice Mid and East Antrim Council’s support for Foster Care Fortnight. Foster Care Fortnight runs from  –  May and aims to help and encourage the wider society to understand and value fostering and the positive dference it can make to young people’s lives.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor, Peter Johnston said: “Thousands of new foster families are needed every year to care for children, with the greatest need being for older children, sibling groups and children with additional needs.“Currently, around , children and young people are living in foster care and with less people coming forward to offer homes, there has never been a greater need for foster carers. “You really could make a dference to the lives of vulnerable children and young people.”Councillor Adger MBE shared her personal story at last week’s meeting of full council, putting forward a Notice of Motion on the issue which was unanimously supported by Elected Members.She said afterwards: “Foster carers in Northern Ireland do an incredible job ensuring children are nurtured, loved and protected.“As a foster carer myself for over  years and having fostered  children during this time, I can hand on my heart say it is the most rewarding job.“From newborn to  years of age, the children that entered our home gave us so much love and it really was a pleasure to provide each child with a loving and safe environment during their time of need.“We hope that the increased awareness of Foster Care Fortnight will build support for fostering, challenge stigma surrounding children in foster care and encourage more people to come forward to foster. There is a good support network out there for foster carers to avail of, so you are not alone in this role.”For more information on Adoption or Foster Care please contact HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care on T:    or visit W: www.adoptionandfostercare.hscn.net  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800422.jpg--.jpg?1620900292000\n","title":"brave jessica is an inspiration","story":"JESSICA Philpott’s battle back from le changing surgery would put many an adult to shame!This is the view of proud mum Julie who told the  this week that her -year-old daughter has coped remarkably well.“Every day Julie has pushed on with courage, resilience and sheer determination that would put any adult to shame,” said Julie.It was back on April  that Jessica, who was born with Apert Syndrome, a Craniofacial condition that affects the development of the head and limbs, was operated on for  hours by a team of  highly skilled surgeons, ranging from neurosurgeons to craniofacial surgeons to plastic surgeons, each playing a vital role in the reshaping of Jessicas face and skull.This surgery carries high risks, risks that they were all too aware of due to the fact that surgeons were operating so close to the brain.Julie explained that distraction of Jessica’s face started on Tuesday, May , and the plan is to continue with this twice a day for - weeks.“We are already seeing a massive dference to the structure of Jessicas face and she is loving the change and has shown such grace and dignity throughout the last  weeks, we are immensely proud of her,” said JulieNo chat with Julie or Jessica is complete with a mention of the Slemish College pupil’s beloved Ballymena United!“The love and support for Jessica from everyone at the club over the last few years has been amazing, but in particular over the last few weeks theyve been there willing her on,” outlined Julie.Meanwhile, the surgery that Jessica has just had is actually one of,not the most expensive surgeries in the world!“Great Ormond Street Hospital has fully funded this surgery for Jessica and we cannot thank them enough for what theyve done for Jessica and I during our stay here so far,” said Julie.“Not just the surgeons, nurses and medical team, but also the auxillary staff, domestic staff and catering staff, they all play a vital role and have been a tremendous source of support and encouragement to us as a family. It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

With permanent secretaries often raising concerns about value for money and the inability to properly mitigate the risks associated with potential misuse of public funds, review and evaluation of the schemes approved under ministerial direction will be important in the time ahead, he said.We should however also recognise that the original aims to get help to those in need was laudable and hindsight is a wonderful thing. An immense effort was put in by civil servants to deliver the support needed with some working long hours, seven days a weeks for which I remain truly grateful.We may all judge things dferently in the cold light of day when the immense pressure to turn around support has dissipated but reviewing lessons learnt will be crucial alongside why schemes where estimated to cost much more than what was paid out with strict eligibility criteria and application processes often deterring precisely those the initiatives were designed to assist.The Department of Financesaid: “When an inidual minister confirms a direction to their accounting officer, either the DoF minister’s approval is sought or a decision is reached at the Executive to agree to the course of action.The accounting officer will then noty the Comptroller and Auditor General who will in turn alert the Public Accounts Committee.“The issuing of ministerial directions has enabled much needed financial assistance to be delivered to support the health service, help businesses, safeguard jobs and protect the most vulnerable in society.”With unprecedented levels of Government spending due to the pandemic, many have predicted a severe economic downturn — and even a recession — in the near future, when some funds need to be repaid.Last month, the Executive agreed funding for a £m plan to help the economy recover from the impact of the Covid- pandemic.Finance Minister Conor Murphy, however, warned that, when one-off Covid funding is excluded, most departments will see their core budget fall in real terms.Choices will have to be made, public services will have to be prioritised,” he said.Covid has presented massive challenges but the vaccination programme has been hugely successful and we hope we can soon move towards economic recovery.Earlier this month the Belfastreported the potential need to top-slice departmental budgets by more than £.bn over the next two decades to fund the pension scheme for those injured during the Troubles,the Treasury does not foot the bill.

She is commonly described as outgoing, ordinary and sociable by Assembly colleagues.She is certainly the DUP’s most liberal representative on social issues. When asked about same-sex marriage by this newspaper in , she predicted that it would be legalised in the next decade due to “changing attitudes”.She voiced her disapproval of Gregory Campbell’s ‘curry my yoghurt’ mockery of the Irish language in . Neither was she impressed when Sammy Wilson refused to wear a red ribbon in solidarity with those living with HIV AIDS.“I#m a member of the DUP who has worked and formed really good friendships with people of dferent religions and sexual orientations,” she said.“I know those people for who they are and that has given me a broader outlook. I can see how some of the decisions we make affect people. I see faces when I make decisions.” Although she believes in God, she is not a practising Christian.Bradley grew up in Mossley in Newtownabbey. Her mum was a social worker, her dad was a driver, and her brother Daniel is a hairdresser. She had a big extended family and summers were spent in her grandparents’ caravan in Ballyhalbert.She has two adult children, Josh and Jess, with ex-husband Robert Bradley. They were orced at . “It wasn’t amicable and we’re not in touch,” she candidly admitted in a wide ranging Belfastinterview in .“We were too young. I was  when I got married. If one of my children had come home at  and told me they were getting married, I#d have said #No way#.”As a young mother, she got into debt, facing the repossession of her home after she separated from her husband. “He went back to England and I was left with a mortgage and two children. Financially, it was really, really hard,” she said.“They were coming the following day to evict me, then I told my parents. They went to the mortgage company, took out a loan and paid what I owed. The arrears had crept up, but I#d buried my head in the sand. I ignored the problem because I didn#t want to be seen as a failure as a mother.“It was a traumatic period. I had two children, aged seven and five, who needed me and I was the one who was supposed to look after and protect them.”On leaving school, she had worked in a canteen kitchen before joining the RUC as a part-time reserve when she was . Bradley was one of the few women in the force at the time. She says it was “an interesting job, but not the career I wanted.”She secured a communications job in DUP headquarters in . After that, she worked as a social care assistant for the Northern Trust from -, but she remained politically active.She was elected onto Newtownabbey Council in  and became mayor in . Nigel Dodds asked her to run for Stormont in . Her son told her to “wise up” but she talked him round, and she was elected.Bradley told this reporter last year that she had never experienced sexism at Stormont, and that her previous jobs in the police and health service had been much more challenging in that regard.But she said social media abuse was widespread: “You#re called horrendous names. I#m not just a politician, I#m a mummy and a granny.“I#ve been told #You should have been aborted at birth# and #I hope your children die#. My kids read this stuff. When I put out a statement online, I#m fearful of what will come.Yes she said there was a spirit of sisterhood in Stormont: “Women from other parties will ring each other and support each other when something horrible happens.”She has said she is frequently mistaken for Alliance MLA, Paula Bradshaw: “We both receive each other#s mail and emails.

She got orced from her husband of  years, William Hull, saw the couple’s two children Fi and Euan fly the nest, got herself a new partner and of course made a ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’ switch from reporting to public relations.It is fair to say that, workwise, the last year has been the most challenging.“I’m good in a crisis and Covid- really was a crisis it still is,” she said.“We had so many messages to put out. Close the hospitals to visitors, stay m apart, wear face coverings... every time something happened, we had to change the signage around the hospital and the messages on social media and where. It was mad, but I had a brilliant team.”She added: “I’ve been so inspired by the people who work in this Trust.“The other day, for instance, I overheard one nurse asking the othershe was coming for lunch and the other replied ‘No, a patient in my ward is so worried about his dog I’ve been going up every day at lunchtime to walk it’.“Here was someone on a -hour sht giving up her only meal for a wee man who she knows won’t get well while he’s fretting about his dog.”Jeanie appeared to change careers effortlessly in  after  years in UTV, but now admits it was “a huge transition”.“Leaving was like missing an arm or a leg,” she said.“UTV really was a family. I almost grieved for that family when I left.”Departure from the broadcaster was, however, inevitable.“There really didn’t seem to be a place left for me,” she recalled.“UTV Le, the programme I edited, was axed [it has since been brought back] and my actual job role as features editor was also axed.“Television was a wonderful world to work in but I’ve really enjoyed my time at the Trust. The health service is full of inspirational people.”She is proud of her Trust being the first locally to embrace social media, which was in its infancy when she started.“It was a bit of an uphill struggle at the start because people still think it’s a bad thing but for us it has become an important medium, especially during the pandemic,” she said.“The mainstream media are only interested in the big stories but we’ve been able to showcase all the other important things that go on in the Trust as well. I’m looking forward to going, but also sorry to leave.”Jeanie , who is being succeeded at the Trust by another ex-UTV reporter, Jane Loughrey, can now spend more quality time with partner Gary Mawhinney , a retired sound engineer and former UTV colleague.“It turned out that we’d known each other most of our lives but we only realised recently that we were very good as a couple,” she said.“To be honest, I didn’t expect to meet anybody . I didn’t want to for a lot of years. But we’re happy and looking forward to a whole new world.”Another thing Jeanie will be able to find more time for now is hill-walking and, her most recent pursuit, running. She added: “Probably the one thing I’m most proud of in my le is I took up fitness quite late, in my s, and I’ve now ran  half marathons. I’m very proud of that.”With regard to close family, daughter Fiis a ‘hula-hoopist’.“Strangely, it is a career,” said Jeanie.“She does festivals and council events, all sorts. She#s also done things for people with mental ill-health.Euanworks in IT and is currently seeking a new job in that profession.In between those siblings, for a tragically short period of time, was Conor, who would have turned  later this year.“Losing him was really awful but the very wonderful thing about it was the way I was looked after, funnily enough in the Ulster Hospital,” she said.“In those days there were no bereavement policies or protocols or pathways to follow but the midwives were just instinctively so good to me that it carried me through the whole thing, and also family and friends.“I visit his grave in Greyabbey every year on his birthday, October ”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots elected DUP leader as he pledges to #fight# the NI Protocol and work together with other unionistsLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyWhich way will they go  DUP MPs and MLAs cast votes for new party leaderSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Top VideosPlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leader\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayArmy bomb disposal sweep Belfast primary school following telephone bomb warningLatest Northern IrelandLegal changes will ‘traumatise’ asylum-seeking children in NISuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists ButlerHow Northern Ireland has become the go-to location for film and TV makers as six productions shoot all at onceLatestWaiting lists for properties by the lakes in FermanaghViewpointOpinionAttitude of PM needs to changeAllen SleithOpinionThought for the weekendJoris MinneOpinionTaste of Ethiopia restaurant review: Combination of flavours like nothing you have tasted beforeHigh demand driving price rises in parts of Armagh,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: PAPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueIssue: the RUC posterClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has described the inclusion of a police poster about the Omagh bomb in an online auction as being “in bad taste”, and accused the auctioneer of making “a crass attempt” at profiteering.Kenny Donaldson, director of services at South East Fermanagh Foundation , said he believed the artefact was “an odd entry to have within any auction”.But Dublin-based Whyte’s Irish Art and Collectables told the Belfastthat “it’s important that these things are kept”, adding: “Putting a value on them makes sure that people don’t destroy them.”The poster, described by the auction house as being in “very fine” condition, was released by the Royal Ulster Constabularyfollowing the atrocity in which  people, including nine children, a woman pregnant with twins and three generations of one family, died.Under the word “murder”, written in large red block capitals, it highlights the date of the Real IRA massacre in the Co Tyrone market town on Saturday August , as well as chilling pictures of the maroon Vauxhall Cavalier used by the dissidents.One of the photos, of a father and son standing close to the bomb-laden car in Market Street, went on to become the defining image of one of the worst atrocities in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles.In the poster, however, Spanish visitor Gonzalo Cavedo and his son, who survived the explosion, have been bleached out, as have other bystanders standing in the distance behind them.The auction house, Dublin-based Whyte’s, is inviting bids for the . x  inchoffering on its website, whytes.ie. Bidding is due to close on Saturday.The poster was distributed throughout Northern Ireland just over a week after the attack, and also featured in a televised appeal for information.Despite the massive manhunt for the perpetrators of the murderous act, which came four months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, no one has ever been convicted of the bombing in a criminal court.In , however, former Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt and three others – Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly – were found liable in a landmark civil trial taken by relatives of the victims.Mr Donaldson said he was appealing to Whytes “to show some level of social conscience and sensitivity to the lives ravaged by terrorism, north and south of the border and to think more carefully about the impact upon those already so grievously wronged”.“The inclusion of a framed poster of an appeal by the RUC seeking information regarding the Omagh Bomb - an incident which claimed the largest loss of lives in the context of Northern Ireland - is in bad taste and will be seen by many of those directly impacted as a crass attempt to profiteer from their pain,” said Mr Donaldson.He added that some years ago the auctioneer “stocked and sold an item which was particularly controversial - an RPG rocket launcher”.Ian Whyte, managing director of the auction house, said the poster was being sold by a collector who’s “trimming down his collection”.He said it was estimated to fetch between £ and £ but at the time of going to print the leading bid had already hit £.Mr Whyte said “all sorts of collectors” are likely to be interested in buying the poster.“It was a dreadful event but it’s part of our history, unfortunately,” he said.“There are collectors and museums who want such things to show people what went on at the time.“We deal in history. Our history sales go from ,BC right up to  years ago and we include anything that’s of historical merit in our auctions.”He added: “It’s important that these things are recorded. It is a chilling piece of history but it’s important that artefacts like this are preserved and kept – either by private or public collections.”Mr Whyte said he understands why some people might find it insensitive adding that other auction items have also attracted complaints in the past, including an IRA rocket launcher.“We’ve had RUC material as well – riot helmets, batons - and stuff to do with paratroopers,” he said.“It is history. I can understandsome people might be a little bit upset about it butthere wasn’t a value attached to these things they’d just end up in the skip and we’d never see them again.”He added: “It’s important that these things are kept and putting a value on them makes sure that people don’t destroy them.”In April , the Dublin auction house owner was quizzed by gardai after selling a rocket-propelled grenadefor £,. The anti-tank weapon was exhibited as part of Whyte’s Eclectic Collector sale and fetched almost twice as much as the guide price..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots elected DUP leader as he pledges to #fight# the NI Protocol and work together with other unionistsLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyWhich way will they go  DUP MPs and MLAs cast votes for new party leaderSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Top VideosPlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leader\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayArmy bomb disposal sweep Belfast primary school following telephone bomb warningLatest Northern IrelandBlack and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeLegal changes will ‘traumatise’ asylum-seeking children in NISuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists ButlerLatestDonal SkehanOpinionHow to spice up your le A surprising and delightful partner to food... why sherry is not just for granny at ChristmasDiarmuid GavinOpinionSay #I do# to wedding cake treeFrank MitchellOpinionBy staying in Belfast, I#m making le easier for both seagull and SwannThe Settlement: #Whatever it takes, or whoever leads the way, we want peace# ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The historic parallels between the challenges facing the DUP leader designate and the forefather of unionism, Carson, who campaigned to stop Home Rule, are almost too obvious to draw attention to.And the media and the public will demand answers to them sooner than later.For now, though, Mr Poots can enjoy the buzz around his appointment.As he was ferried off, a family looked on bemused, with a child asking: “Will this be on TV ” The answer was yes. As unionism faces the crossroads, it is also one for the history books..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leEdwin Poots elected DUP leader as he pledges to #fight# the NI Protocol and work together with other unionistsIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyWhich way will they go  DUP MPs and MLAs cast votes for new party leaderSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Top VideosPlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leader\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayArmy bomb disposal sweep Belfast primary school following telephone bomb warningLatest PoliticsSuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists Butler£bn in Covid aid was pushed through by Stormont ministersGail Walker, Editor-at-LargeOpinionA letter from NI in  to its younger self... hang in there, you do have a place in the worldLatestStephen CraiganOpinionCeltic legend Scott Brown has been the envy of every club in Scotland… even though they wouldn’t admit itDonal SkehanOpinionHow to spice up your le A surprising and delightful partner to food... why sherry is not just for granny at ChristmasDiarmuid GavinOpinionSay #I do# to wedding cake treeFrank MitchellOpinionBy staying in Belfast, I#m making le easier for both seagull and Swann,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots elected DUP leader as he pledges to #fight# the NI Protocol and work together with other unionistsLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyWhich way will they go  DUP MPs and MLAs cast votes for new party leaderSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Top VideosPlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leader\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayArmy bomb disposal sweep Belfast primary school following telephone bomb warningLatest NewsBlack and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeWaiting lists for properties by the lakes in FermanaghAllen SleithOpinionThought for the weekendMortgage market is picking upPost-Covid era rings the changes in north westLatestDonal SkehanOpinionHow to spice up your le A surprising and delightful partner to food... why sherry is not just for granny at ChristmasDiarmuid GavinOpinionSay #I do# to wedding cake treeFrank MitchellOpinionBy staying in Belfast, I#m making le easier for both seagull and SwannThe Settlement: #Whatever it takes, or whoever leads the way, we want peace# ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, says that as a working class movement DTUC has provided a voice for workers and social justice campaigns. It aims to further reach out with the launch of a local workers survey, as it extends its solidarity with the people of Derry and District demanding an end to the many hardships which workers and their families experience and have experienced for far too long. Mr McCarroll says: Like everyone  I have listened to plenty of guff over the years. Hang in there is the message from all sections of the establishment, we are sympathetic and very empathetic we know things are dficult butyou keep working for nothing with no improvements things will improve. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, hotel workers, health care assistants, nursing home workers, shop workers, classroom assistants, retail workers, community, voluntary sector workers and indeed call centre staff have all heard this and still they wait, we all wait. We need to organise and begin to direct our own affairs, we need to represent ourselves because we are not being represented. He adds: Derry Trades Union Council call upon all local workers to join a trade union, get active in your local branch and shape your trade union into a fighting, working class organisation. This is how we will change our lives make our communities better, create a culture of solidarity across all workplaces, uniting all workers. Lets begin to create this new modern workers movement. googletag.cmd.push Unionised workers of the past, including our local factory workers championed the cause of labour and won many of the rights we take for granted today such as maternity pay,  hour days and weekends off. Todays demands are not being won, workers need decent pay and we must collectively mobilise to end the scourge of poverty pay, creating the situation were no worker needs to work two jobs to survive. By completing the DTUC survey we can commence the call to mobilise, use this survey to bring us together - together we can make a dference - together we can deliver for each other.     We are told by the privileged few that we must wait to gain the same privileges. Time is up.

This year more than ever, it is important to celebrate the incredible contributions that nurses make to our society. One such inidual who deserves a special mention is Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist Margaret Carlin who was named Cancer Nurse of the Year  at the Royal College of Nursing Awards NI. Margaret is from Magherafelt and is based at Antrim Area Hospital. She has been caring for local people for almost  years and has just retired from her full-time post. googletag.cmd.push Margaret took up her role as a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist in the Mid Ulster Hospital in . “My post was created as a result of collaboration between Macmillan Cancer Support and what is now the Northern Health and Social Care Trust,” recalls Margaret. “It was important to have a full-time nurse specialist who could provide expert advice, support and information to patients who were living with cancer or a le limiting illness.” Following Margaret’s appointment, her sterling work in the community was well known. Funds, however, were needed to continue to support her role and this inspired a group of iniduals in the Magherafelt area to form a fundraising committee. googletag.cmd.push In their time, Magherafelt Fundraising Committee raised over pound,, pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support in Northern Ireland. “Over the years I have met and cared for many people with cancer and other le limiting conditions, often at times of great distress for them, their families and loved ones,” explains Margaret. “They have allowed me into their lives and to be with them throughout their illness. They have shared their thoughts and feelings with me and told me about their hopes and fears for the future. We laughed together and sometimes we cried together. “Throughout the years, I continue to meet people who I met at the time when they were diagnosed with cancer.     “I am always glad to see them and it makes me really happy to see the quality of le they continue to have. I also meet many families whose loved ones I cared for, who sadly have died, and I am always touched that they remember me and the times we spent together. “They tell me about their lives now and changes there have been. “They tell me how their children and grandchildren have grown up and are doing well and this reminds me that I will always be part of their memories and how privileged I am to be a Macmillan nurse.” Margaret initially trained as a nursing student in Mid Ulster Hospital from - and following this worked as a staff nurse in the Mid Ulster Hospital. It was in October  that she became a Macmillan nurse, delivering chemotherapy to patients as well as helping to set up and establish palliative care services. In , Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital as Macmillan Lung Cancer Nurse Specialist. “Since Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital, she has worked tirelessly to raise the standards of the care delivered to patients diagnosed with lung cancer,” explains Sally Convery, Macmillan Service Lead for Palliative Care. “Margaret is passionate about caring for the inidual and is very focused on ensuring patients are recognised as people and not by their diagnosis. “She encourages them to focus on the positive aspects of le and not on their diagnosis. Margaret is an excellent role model to the other lung cancer nurses and demonstrates her passion for ensuring safe and effective care. “She continually strives to improve the patient’s quality of le and has shown outstanding commitment to the creation and delivery of a pulmonary prehabilitation self-management programme for patients with lung cancer. “Margaret believes it is important services are delivered with patients and relatives at the forefront and because of this she is involved in and promotes ious lung cancer support groups in the area as well as co-ordinating a support group that is regularly reviewed by patients. “As well as this, she has driven forward a campaign to increase the awareness of lung cancer symptoms and has lead a team of her colleagues to visit local shopping centres and share leaflets ensuring members of the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. She is always looking at ways to get the message out there in innovative ways.” Sally continued: “Margaret is a wonderful resource of expert knowledge and she has certainly shown outstanding leadership in cancer and palliative care for almost  years’ service. “We are delighted that she has agreed tofor a short time following her retirement to ensure the service continues to deliver high quality care and we wish her the very best in her future, we will miss her.” Margaret concluded: “Although I have officially retired from my full-time post, I will continue in my role as a Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist two days a week for another year. “I will really miss my colleagues and all the people that I have met and cared for over the years.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jade Bradley, who is originally from Hatmore Park in the Foyle Springs area of the city, is the founder of Restore Nutrition, a wellness company that specialises in helping people with their nutrition to deliver a better quality of le. Jade embarked on her own mental and physical health journey several years ago having struggled with anxiety. She used a blended approach which included yoga, meditation, music, therapy and the input from a kinesiologist that advised on food issues and intolerances. googletag.cmd.push Within two months of implementing these changes, Jade saw a massive change resulting in better sleep, more energy and a feeling of being more ‘restored.’ It was this that sparked her desire to educate herself in naturopathic nutrition. She moved to London and studied at the College of Naturopathic Medicine and became a member of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. She launched Restore Nutrition in  and the company has since gone from strength to strength. working with over  private clients and organisations including, Seagate, Business in the Community, Hurt, Waterside Neighbourhood Partnership, Belfast Food Network, Hillcrest, Culmore Hub, Foyle Women’s Information Group, Derry Well Woman and Youth Action. googletag.cmd.push Speaking about her new programme, Jade said: “We are living in a stressed out society, and having the main pillars of health and wellbeing in place is essential to help deal with stress and anxiety. If the fundamentals aren’t in place, it is impossible for us to excel.” Jade said these fundamentals were more important than ever given the challenging times we are all in. She added: “I centre our work around four pillars which we delve into on the ‘Kick Start’ programme namely: hydration, reducing toxic load, restoring with whole foods and managing stress and sleep.” She said she has found most people want a quick fix or a magic pill when it came to their health and wellbeing journey.     “Unfortunately, this does not exist,” she said. “It is best to make small changes incrementally and embark on this journey in stages starting off with the fundamentals which is exactly what we do in our new programme. “Furthermore, it is so important to tackle mental health issues with an all-round approach and this is why I have worked with local mental health therapist, Caroline McMenamin, on many projects over the past two years and plan to do more collaborations throughout the year.” The ‘Kick Start’ nutrition programme is available for business groups, charities, community groups and inidual attendees and runs over four weeks in one-hour sessions. You can obtain more information, costs and sign up by emailing Jade:info@ restorenutrition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Nine of the team started the  meeting of the teams, a night when Benny Heron, Paul Cassidy and Conor Glass came off the bench. Having handed out  debuts in his first season as Derry boss, there is a more settled look to Rory Gallaghers squad this season. Paul Cassidy is listed to start for the second time after making his full debut against Offaly in Tullamore last season. There is a first inclusion for Gareth McKinless since Derrys  All-Ireland Qualier win over Cavan. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul played virtually every minute under Gallagher last season, bar a th minute late black card in the McKenna Cup against Monaghan and being replaced in the th minute of their win over Louth. He is one of four Glen men listed to start on Saturday. Danny Tallon, who started all  games last season, isnt included in the starting line-up. There is no place for Slaughtneil defender Karl McKaigue who has made a full recovery from the torn Achilles sustained on club hurling championship duty last summer. The only three members of the current  yet to make their debuts are Bellaghy duo Ronan McFaul and Conleth McShane, as well as Glen goalkeeper Connlan Bradley. googletag.cmd.push Goals from Patrick Kearney and Paul Cassidy helped Derry to victory when the sides met last season at Celtic Park. Derry and Longford have met eight times in the last two decades, in league and championship. The Oakleafers have to go back to  for their last win at Pearse Park, when two Anthony Tohill goals and an inspired performance from current selector Enda Muldoon put Derry on their way to victory. In the other game in Division  North, Ulster champions take on Fermanagh on Saturday evening in Brewster Park . Derry will face Fermanagh next Saturday in Owenbeg .

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Government Boundaries Commissioner Sarah Havlin has outlined further details about her review of the  district council boundaries and the proposed timetable and process for public consultation. This includes publishing a short information video to outline the review process and highlighting why and how people can get involved. This also coincides with the start of a series of ‘Meet the Commissioner’ briefing events with council representatives from across all  councils. By the end of July this year, the Commissioner plans to publish provisional proposals, outlining any proposed changes to local government boundaries. googletag.cmd.push The closing date for written submissions about these provisional proposals will be September  this year. After this, a series of public hearings will be held to gather further feedback and these will be subject to the relevant covid- public health guidance at that time. Thereafter, there will be a period of analysis of the representations and public hearing reports, before the preparation of revised proposals which will again be subject to further consultation. The review is something that by law has to happen every eight- years and although the last review took place in   with the final recommendations from that providing the basis for the last review of local government boundaries which after legislation and elections etc, took effect from  when the new councils came into being. googletag.cmd.push The last review, which saw Derry City Council and Strabane District Council combine to make Derry City and Strabane District Council, coincided with the change in local government which saw the signicant change from  to  councils so was more substantial in nature. This review will take into account changes in electoral changes housing changes among other things since  and make recommendation on the boundaries of the  current districts and the ious wards that make them up. It’s hard to know what the initial proposals will show as modelling electoral analysis etc is ongoing but there may well be some local government boundaries changing.     The review will also examine the potential for changes to the names of local wards to reflect local considerations. The review, when completed next year, will then need to be legislated on before any actual boundary changes would take effect. Boundary Commissioner, Sarah Havlin, is encouraging everyone with an interest to get involved in what she described this important review. everyone with an interest to get involved. “We have also published an information video to highlight how and why people should get involved. The outcomes will inform the make-up of local government in the foreseeable future andwill consider the impact of electorate changes since  and other recent developments. “The process is about independently ensuring electoral equality and fairness across Northern Ireland, with the aim that all the wards within a district should, as far as possible, have a similar number of electors. “With that I mind, it’s important that we hear the views of local people and their representatives on these matters, and I would encourage people to regularly check our website and social media channels for more information on how they can have their voice heard in this process.” Review details can be found athttps:www. lgbc-ni.org.uk or via Twitter and Facebook @LGBCNI.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The player himself would be frustrated at having his vintage display cut short. googletag.cmd.push Thats the problem with almost being on the senior team. Youre caught between two stools. Everyone  knows where they stand in the pecking order. Johnny must be in the seniors plans,” the auld hands would mumble as he trotted off. He might get five minutes in the senior game. He might get . He might get none. It just depended on how things were going. Thats how it was. If another player on the reserve team, lets call him Paddy, kicked the last two scores, made a goal line block or emptied some man out over the sideline, hed dine off legendary status. googletag.cmd.push “Youd some game Paddy,” somebody would tell him, over the wire, as he pulled on a senior sub jersey. “Youd be starting in the seniors every weekI was over that team.” By the time Paddy pulls up a stool at the bar later that night, and puts manners in his first pint, his bone crunching shoulder challenge has now exaggerated ten times over. “He put yer man through the wire,” would be the latest. And nobody is going to dampen a good story. That was Sunday every week in the club leagues. Tuesday night at training was the time to put in your shout for the senior team next week. And so the cycle continued.     The alternative is playing the reserve game afterwards, with anyone not getting a decentof time in the senior game will get their fill of football. But the self esteem must take an awful battering as almost everyone leaves after the senior game. It depends what your take is. As much as that model served the GAA well, it has its downfall. With the level of preparation at club level going through the roof, the whole weeks diet, rest and social le revolves around the Sunday. Social media went into meltdown last week, with everyone salivating over their Friday night slot for senior games, like Downs tried and tested formula. In theory, it is a great idea. Friday night pints. Saturday and Sunday to take your better half or family out for the day Training on a Monday and Wednesday night, ready to go again. There are two drawbacks. At the height of the Celtic Tiger, with players working in Dublin or further afield, it was a squeeze to get home for a training session at eight oclock, never mind racing home for six oclock to play a reserve game as part of a double header. Secondly, splitting the reserve and senior games to dferent days leaves twice the amount of travel, for the fringe senior players who will be on both squads, while leaving you back where you started with a reserve game on the Sunday. For me, Saturday six oclock and half seven is the answer. It is somewhere in between. It leaves Saturday night free for players to do as they please and get themselves in order for training the following week. The only people it will affect are those who are mixing their GAA with the local soccer or rugby team. But, maybe this is where a compromise needs to be reached. In some places, soccer and rugby keep players fitness ticking over during the off-season. And vice versa. Rather than going loggerheads, clubs could select a certain number of their games for Sunday until the soccer and rugby seasons are over, before moving to Saturday. It wouldnt be every club. In a way, it also gives local GAA clubs an advantage. How many times have you wanted to go and watch the crunch game of the weekend, but cant because you have a game of your own. I always use the example of going to watch Lavey and Ballinderry in a late Sunday evening game. The rest of Derry had the chance to call in on their way home. There was a bumper crowd and an electric atmosphere for players. Everybody is a winner. So of the  games in the Derry A and B leagues, have half on a Sunday, half on a Saturday and one on a Friday night. Set the dates in stone, which gives players six free Sundays they wouldnt normally have had. There is the option of taking your kids to the pool, book a weekend away, nurse a hangover or watch a county game. The licence to do any of those things will make GAA less of a strain on the weekend. The Sunday fixture does suit the supporter, but they arent obliged to go to a game every weekend andthey do, itll take up three hours at the most. Players are dferent. Theyll dedicate Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, with all the sacrices they make in between. Their voice should be heard above the rest. Imagine the weekend Paddy would have, living off kicking three points to win the reserve game and pummelling the oppositions hatchet man in the process.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister.

Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year. I think they are amazing. As a teacher myself I think its great to have such books for children showing ersity.Cara inspired a new fashion range earlier this year for girls and teens born with the same condition as her.She hopes to be a spokesperson and campaigner for people with dwarfism in the future.The Irish Roots Festival, created by Tipperary native Lorraine Maher, finishes today.Speaking about the festival, she said: ldquoMixed-race people are one of the fastest growing demographics in the western world, it is crucial to highlight the lives, achievements and struggles of mixed-race Irish people.ldquoThis is a great opportunity to give a shout out globally to those of Irish ancestry regardless of colour or location, she said. ldquoRepresentation is so important for a sense of well-being and belonging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Developers.jpg","title":"Developers invited to enter bids for redevelopment site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will be asked within the next few weeks to submit their respective bids for the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police base in Downpatrick.The news was confirmed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee on Monday evening.Stretching back as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, the proposed development site includes the Irish Street car park and a number of empty buildings adjacent to the former police base.It is understood that five developers and  community groups have expressed an interest in the site with its regeneration being spearheaded by the Department for Communitiesand the local authorityThe development brief paves the way for the regeneration of the sprawling site and developers will be given up to  weeks to submit their respective proposals with a final assessment then made to select the preferred bidder who will be responsible for all planning and construction costs.Once a developer has been selected, the company will be given a year to secure planning approval and to complete the regeneration of the site within three years.Councillors were due to discuss a motion at Monday nightrsquos meeting which urged the council to acquire land to create a road access through the development site on to St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of the redevelopment proposal and also upgrade and integrate three adjoining privately owned car parks into the proposal.Debate on the motion was adjourned, but in papers submitted prior to the committee meeting senior council staff made it clear that any change would result in the suspension of the development brief and changes to the projectrsquos business case.The local authority has been working on the Irish Street project in partnership with the DfC for some time and when the police base became available for sale, the local authority commissioned a feasibility study exploring options around how the site could be developed in tandem with the Irish Street car park.The study concluded that a so-called mixed use development of the sprawling site would be the most suitable option with the government department subsequently acquiring the land, with the local authority purchasing a strip of land between the Irish Street car park and the former police base.A project board was then set up comprising Downpatrick area councillors and a number of local stakeholders including business community representatives which sought the views of developers and the local community around the sitersquos potential uses and constraints.It was confirmed on Monday night that based on the feedback the development brief was worked up and will go to market in the coming weeks. Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward.

Yet people who work with Mr Poots typically depict a broad minded, personable and pragmatic man.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It will be a sadness to Mr Poots that his father, Charles, who helped found the DUP and who died last year, did not live to see his son become the party leader.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, gracious in defeat as you would expect from a man so courteous in his public appearances, will remain a hugely influential figure in the DUP and the political le of NI, as well as an ambassador for unionism.The challenges facing Mr Poots are many, not least because of his narrow victory. His plan to split the DUP leadership from first minister poses dficulties, not least the matter of who he will make NI’s head of government.If Mr Poots strikes a friendly tone, it will be easier for him to be firm on the Irish Sea border. The worst of all worlds would be to look tough but act weak on matters such as legacy and the Northern Ireland Protocol. We warmly congratulate Mr Poots and his deputy Paula Bradley on their elections to lead the DUP, and wish them well at the helm of the biggest unionist party.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area.

Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our bike share schemes are there to benefit the whole community, which is why we want to hear from as many people as possible.Nextbike docking stations have to be close to popular destinations such as existing transport links, job centres, supermarkets and other shops be in an area of high footfall be highly visible and easy to find have enough space to allow safe movement of pedestrians and people with limited mobility and be accessible by van or bike trailer to allow the nextbike service team to maintain the bikes and stations.     Final decisions will be made based on the above criteria, in addition to the ability to get power to the locations, which is determined by power providers.Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe nextbike e-bike hire scheme in Penarth has proved extremely successful.\"Since its launch, the hire of the bikes has been steadily increasing.ldquoWith the onset of summer, we have implemented a new docking station at Cosmeston, and very soon there will be a new docking station in Sully.\"I am convinced the scheme will only go from strength to strength.ldquoTwo additional docking stations in Dinas Powys will complement the existing nextbike network within the Vale of Glamorgan and provide an additional sustainable transport link between these three areas.\"I would encourage Dinas Powys residents to respond to the consultation as itrsquos important they are located where they are accessible to as many people as possible.Penarthrsquos existing stations are located at the Esplanade, Llandough Hospital, Windsor Road, Penarth Train Station, the Barrage and the recently-installed Cosmeston.While the Penarth bikes can currently only be rented and ed to Penarth stations, the ambition is to eventually link the scheme to nextbikersquos Cardf fleet, meaning commuters will be able to use the e-bikes to make the journey between the town and the city with ease.E-bikes are a combination of a conventional bike with a motor that take some of the effort out of pedalling for the rider. With top speeds of km per hour, the e-bikes can cover greater distances in less time and with less effort than conventional cycles.E-bike rental costs pound per  minutes for customers with a monthly or annual membership, or pound per  minutes on a pay as you ride basis.The consultation runs until May .

Furthermore, millions of people neither have, nor do they apply for, a passport or driving licence.ldquoSo,Government forces them to apply for a new ID, evenit is free and is to be provided at the considerable expense of taxpayer money, many Brits will decide to ignore that bureaucratic process and end up not applying, which will ultimately lead to them being excluded from their democratic right to vote.Turnout for the General Election in  was. per cent, down . per cent on the election in . Mr Dhesi referred to voter ID laws in the USA. In the states, photo ID is needed for voting in  states, including Florida, Texas, Georgia and Michigan . Mr Dhesiraised fears that having a photo ID in order to vote would reduce participation.This sentiment was echoed by Labourrsquos Reading East MP Matt Rodda. Mr Rodda said: ldquoIncidents of electoral fraud by impersonation are incredibly small.

Furthermore, millions of people neither have, nor do they apply for, a passport or driving licence.ldquoSo,Government forces them to apply for a new ID, evenit is free and is to be provided at the considerable expense of taxpayer money, many Brits will decide to ignore that bureaucratic process and end up not applying, which will ultimately lead to them being excluded from their democratic right to vote.Turnout for the General Election in  was. per cent, down . per cent on the election in . Mr Dhesi referred to voter ID laws in the USA. In the states, photo ID is needed for voting in  states, including Florida, Texas, Georgia and Michigan .

The modernisation plans will also support a further  jobs during construction and development. Located at the busy junction of Dromore Road and James Street, the store will occupy an entire space of , sq. metres – more than double the size of its existing store – which will include an expansive sales floor of , sq. metres. The planning application lodged with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council will see the demolition of a neighbouring pub and private dwelling to make way for the expansion on a site that will also incorporate a-space car park with two electric vehicle charging points and new, complementary landscaping. Construction plans encompass Lidl Northern Ireland’s bold ‘concept’ design which prioritises sustainability, spacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms, employee and baby-changing facilities which will dramatically enhance a high-quality shopping experience. The site will also include a large warehouse and improved employee welfare facilities. The application follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in September  which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community. Conor Boyle, regional director for Lidl Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to confirm plans for a replacement store in Omagh which will see the existing store at James Street in the town double in size to provide a dramatically-enhanced shopping experience and new jobs for the area. Centrally located in the west of the region, the Omagh store serves a burgeoning and thriving community base and is conveniently positioned next to the A which is a major primary route and commuter corridor. As a major investor in our communities and in our local economy, the Omagh store is an important location for us, and I am thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to the local area as part of this multimillion-pound investment. We hope to receive planning permission for the site in the coming weeks and we look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store later this year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dacaceeae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acaefaeffd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
