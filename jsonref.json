[{"url":null,"title":"The story picture Andrew Virginia Giuffre Maxwell journalist scooped world","story":"Share this article She was headhunted for the job by Maxwell, who spotted her at Donald Trump\u0027s Mar a Lago club in Palm Beach, where she was a $9-an-hour changing-room assistant and her father was a maintenance manager.The club employed scores of workers in similar positions over the years, but gradually I accumulated clues: a source recalled that her maiden name was Virginia Roberts.And I learned that she continued to date her high-school sweetheart, Tony Figueroa, after Maxwell trained her to give Epstein \u0027erotic massages\u0027.His family\u0027s address was in old property records. They\u0027d moved from Palm Beach, a neighbour told me when I knocked on her door, but she remembered Virginia.\u0027She was a sad, anorexic-looking girl,\u0027 she said.I located Tony in the small town of Flowery Branch, Georgia – an eight-hour drive north of Palm Beach – and he confirmed what had seemed a totally incredible tale.Epstein had approved of him continuing his romance with Virginia, he told me when we met at a coffee shop.\u0027I moved into her apartment in Royal Palm Beach. She was working for Jeffrey. I assume the cash she got from him paid for it.\u0027I would give her rides to his house. I would hang out there – sit by the pool, talk to the chef. Jeffrey treated me like a friend. I never got any weird vibes until she told me what was going on.\u0027And then the bombshell. When Tony picked up Virginia from a trip to London on Epstein\u0027s jet, she showed him a photo of herself with Prince Andrew.\u0027She told me Jeffrey was hanging out with Andrew and she had hung out with him,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was supposedly just massages.\u0027He was sickened because he had come to understand that in Epstein\u0027s warped circles, massage was a euphemism for sex.\u0027I tried to get her to stop the trips with Jeffrey but she didn\u0027t. I think she was scared.\u0027Tony gave me the next lead to Virginia\u0027s whereabouts. Her father\u0027s name, he confided, was Sky Roberts. I left a message at his number, saying I was investigating Epstein.On February 4, 2011, an email landed that would change the course of history for Andrew.\u0027Hi Sharon,\u0027 Virginia wrote. \u0027My Father, Sky Roberts, informed me of your call and I thought I\u0027d send you my contact details so we can get in touch.\u0027When I called her Australian number, her voice was shaky but determined and the first word from her lips was \u0027Andrew\u0027.He was the Royal in her lawsuit, she told me, and, while initially reluctant to talk publicly, she eventually decided she wanted to waive her anonymity and tell her story because she was furious that he was still hanging out with Epstein after the financier\u0027s conviction for offences related to child prostitution.Just a few days before, she had seen a photo – published by the now defunct News of the World – that revealed the Prince had taken a stroll in Manhattan\u0027s Central Park with Epstein after the wealthy pervert had completed a slap- on-the-wrist jail sentence for abusing underage girls.She had also read about a dinner party that Epstein threw for Andrew during the New York visit, which was attended by celebrities including Woody Allen.Little could Andrew have known that that image of him casually chatting to his old friend in the park would end up so enraging Virginia she would agree to talk to me.\u0027I am appalled,\u0027 she told me when I arrived at her modest ranch home 60 miles north of Sydney. \u0027To me, it\u0027s saying, We are above the law.\u0027I was exhausted after 24 hours of travel from my home in New York via San Francisco to Sydney and then a 90-minute drive in a rental car on unfamiliar roads. But from the moment I set eyes on that picture, my jet-lag evaporated.For the entire journey I hadn\u0027t slept because Virginia had warned me she might not be able to find the picture.Now she had found it and, of course, I knew it was a huge scoop. But I had mixed emotions. This was a woman who was a victim of the most evil child sex ring I have heard about during my 40-year career.I was worried for Virginia and the fallout going public would have on her. I knew her life would never be the same again.She was clearly still absolutely terrified of Epstein. She told me she had seen shady characters hanging around her house who she was convinced had been sent by the billionaire to bully and intimidate her into silence.Yet here she was, bravely telling a story which would set off a cataclysmic chain of events that would change her life – and Andrew\u0027s – for ever.By the time I met Virginia, she was happily married to Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts expert whom she met by chance when Epstein flew her to Thailand for a massage course. They had two sons and a daughter.But she couldn\u0027t put the memories of her years in Epstein\u0027s cult-like household behind her. She wanted both him and Andrew to be brought to justice.We sat in her garden and I remember the terror in her eyes as she told her story to a journalist for the first time.She gave me a graphic description of the hours she claims to have spent with the Prince after Maxwell and Epstein left her on that London night. For reasons of taste, they can\u0027t be included here.\u0027It was disgusting,\u0027 she said, shaking her head.\u0027I\u0027ve gone from pain to hurt to anger. Coming from my background, I thought I was important, being with a big, famous man. But being a mother has changed my perspective on life.\u0027After my week-long first meetings with her, I received word that a US prosecutor, Ann Marie Villafana, was trying to reach me. She told me when I called that she had heard I was talking to Virginia.\u0027The FBI would like to fly to Sydney to interview her,\u0027 she said.Virginia wept when I passed on the message. She was still living in fear of Epstein. Would he hurt her, she wondered, if she co-operated with the FBI?And would it do any good? She had talked to some investigators just three years earlier, yet \u0027there\u0027s Jeffrey in Central Park with Andrew\u0027.She agreed to meet two FBI agents. Michael Thomas and I drove her and her husband to the US Consulate in Sydney.We weren\u0027t allowed to accompany Virginia inside, but she told us she confirmed the account she had given us and handed them her collection of snaps, including the print we had copied showing her with Maxwell and the Prince.They handed it back to her after making a scan.Since that day there has been much speculation about what happened to what has been dubbed the \u0027original\u0027 photograph.To the best of my knowledge, she still has it. I\u0027ve never heard anything about her destroying it.A redacted court document reportedly shows that she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 shown in a public record of the meeting.The FBI assigned sequential reference numbers to both the front and back of each photo. But two reference numbers – 03956 9431 and 03956 9432 – are missing from the publicly available document.Panorama was told those two numbers are for the front and back of the Andrew photo and that it was removed from the public document to protect his privacy.The lawmen refused to tell me their verdict on the picture. \u0027But if she faked it, they\u0027d have indicted her a long time ago for perjury,\u0027 I was told by a source familiar with the probe.A Californian digital photography expert, Hany Farid, told The Times he saw no \u0027obvious signs\u0027 that the photo was doctored.\u0027It can be difficult to get the body poses just right when splicing two people together,\u0027 he said.\u0027The fact that the two figures are so seamlessly and closely placed next to each other suggests that this is unlikely to be a full-body splice of Prince Andrew.\u0027The lighting and pose of the head seem consistent with the body and scene, suggesting that it is also unlikely that this is Prince Andrew\u0027s head spliced on to another person\u0027s body,\u0027 he said.Without that photograph, no one would have taken Virginia\u0027s word over that of the Queen\u0027s favourite son.If Andrew still believes it was cooked up by a \u0027gold-digger\u0027, I\u0027m happy to take his call."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry renews Frogmore Cottage lease making eligible serve Queen Counsellor","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry will renew Frogmore Cottage lease to keep serving Queen"},{"url":null,"title":"Man City star Phil Foden mother involved scuffle","story":"Share this articlePhil Foden\u0027s mum Claire, 41, caught in alcohol-fuelled brawl which left a woman with black eyes and bite marks"},{"url":null,"title":"Queen 95 tested positive Covid mild cold like symptoms","story":" The monarch is expected to foot part of the bill for her son\u0027s settlement in a bid to draw a line under it before her much-anticipated Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer.But there is anger at how the Queen has effectively been forced to bail out the \u0027disgraced\u0027 Duke of York, 61, whose modest pension from his time in the Royal Navy is now his only visible income - amid calls for the public to be told who is financing the deal.Andrew marked the quietest royal birthday in modern history yesterday as he looks to lay low after settling his sex abuse case.The muted celebration of his 62nd birthday came just hours after the death of Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s \u0027pimp\u0027, who was accused of trafficking hundreds of girls to the paedophile financier.French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, 76, who allegedly procured more than a thousand women and girls for Epstein to sleep with, was found hanged in his prison cell in an alleged suicide on Saturday morning. And Charles could also be questioned by the Met Police as part of its criminal \u0027cash for honours\u0027 investigation into his aide and charity. The Royal, 73, nor anyone in his household have been spoken to as part of the force\u0027s assessment on whether to probe how a Saudi billionaire donor got a knighthood and UK citizenship after donations to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.Instead officers have liaised with staff at the charity, who have provided documents for the scoping exercise.But Charles and his former right-hand aide Michael Fawcett, 59, have been both explicitly named in the two letters to the Met that sparked the investigation. Fawcett stepped down in October amid claims he promised to help secure a CBE and British citizenship for Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz - a donor to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.It was alleged that he paid thousands of pounds to \u0027fixers\u0027 with links to the prince who said they could secure him an honour in return for donations.Clarence House has denied Charles knew anything about the allegations being investigated. And Prince Harry the monarch has also been dealing with revelations that Prince Harry tried to keep details of his legal battle to reinstate his police protection secret from the public.High Court documents show he sought a far-reaching confidentiality order on documents and witness statements surrounding his case against the Government.But the Home Office argued for transparency, saying \u0027there must be a sufficiently good reason, in the wider public interest, to justify the departure from open justice that such an order involves\u0027. The Queen\u0027s positive test comes as Boris Johnson today urged people to be \u0027more confident and get back to work\u0027 as he heralded this coming Thursday as Covid Freedom Day. The PM gave an upbeat assessment ahead of unveiling his \u0027Living with Covid Plan\u0027 tomorrow, insisting vaccines and new treatments can be relied upon to keep the public safe.All curbs - including legal self-isolation - are set to end in England within days, and Mr Johnson made clear that the taxpayer cannot keep shelling out £2billion a month on mass testing.In a compromise between the Treasury and Department of Health, he will lay out a timetable for axing free tests - but they are still likely to be available for more vulnerable and older age groups.As cases continue to tumble - down 25 per cent week-on-week - Mr Johnson insisted he did not want people to \u0027throw caution to the winds\u0027 but he wanted to remove \u0027compulsion\u0027 and let iniduals take responsibility."},{"url":null,"title":"Capitol fence reinstalled ahead Bidens State Union trucker convoy heads DC","story":"Share this articleCapitol fence to be reinstalled ahead of Biden¿s State of the Union address | Fox NewsUSCP Plans for Extra Security Ahead of the Joint Session of Congress | United States Capitol PoliceAmerican Truckers\u0027 \u0027Freedom\u0027 Convoy to D.C. to Launch February 23, Organizers Say"},{"url":null,"title":"Queen plans honour appointments online phone following positive Covid test","story":"Share this articleBuckingham Palace to remain ‘cautious’ despite relaxing of Covid rules"},{"url":null,"title":"Universities ditch online lectures Covid restrictions lifted minister says","story":"Share this article Universities were yesterday accused of ‘profiting from students’ misery’ as the pandemic saw the majority of teaching move online. The 24 Russell Group members have collectively amassed a surplus of more than £2.2billion, an analysis of their accounts by The Sunday Telegraph found.Miss Donelan was backed by the Office for Students watchdog, which vowed to ‘intervene’ at universities which were not offering an ‘in-person timetable’.Miss Donelan told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘Online teaching should only be used to supplement face-to-face teaching, not replace it.’ A survey last month of Russell Group universities found nine had kept at least a portion online – although some did not reply."},{"url":null,"title":"Boris hails moment pride unveils Living Covid plan TODAY","story":"Share this article   Meanwhile, education unions Unison, Unite and the GMB urged the Prime Minister to keep free testing and the requirement to self-isolate.They warned that failure to provide detailed guidance risks a \u0027super-spreader free-for-all\u0027 in schools and workplaces. A government source said vaccines would be available for the \u0027foreseeable future\u0027, saying avoiding the return of curbs would depend on the \u0027sustained population immunity\u0027 provided by the jabs.It came as the Government yesterday logged another 25,696 daily Covid cases and 74 deaths."},{"url":null,"title":"What does Freedom Day mean business","story":"Share this articleShare this article   Meanwhile, education unions Unison, Unite and the GMB urged the Prime Minister to keep free testing and the requirement to self-isolate.They warned that failure to provide detailed guidance risks a \u0027super-spreader free-for-all\u0027 in schools and workplaces.Referring to \u0027Partygate\u0027 probes, Labour\u0027s health spokesman Wes Streeting said: \u0027Boris Johnson is declaring victory before the war is over, in an attempt to distract from the police knocking at his door.\u0027The Government should publish the evidence behind this decision, so the public can have faith it is being made in the national interest.\u0027A government source said vaccines would be available for the \u0027foreseeable future\u0027, saying avoiding the return of curbs would depend on the \u0027sustained population immunity\u0027 provided by the jabs.It came as the Government yesterday logged another 25,696 daily Covid cases and 74 deaths."},{"url":null,"title":"Weymouth beach hut cartel strikes tenant evicted","story":"Share this article Elizabeth and Tony Fisher have been tenants since 1987 and visit their chalet daily between May and October each year because they are keen sea swimmers.But they received a letter from the trust saying they can no longer lease the chalet and there was no right of appeal.Ms Fisher, a 69-year-old retired modern languages teacher, said they were told they did not renew their lease in time, which they claim is untrue.She said: \u0027We have had a good innings in the chalet and I have been trying hard to think that it is time someone from the waiting list had a chance to enjoy what we have had for so many years.\u0027But the sour taste in the mouth from the suspicion that one has been unfairly dislodged remains.\u0027Mrs Bray was approached for comment but said: \u0027No, we do not talk about inidual people.

Revealed: king of Jordan used Swiss accounts to hoard massive wealth, by Martin Chulov, our Middle East correspondent. In 2011, as popular revolts reverberated around the Middle East, a monarch in the midst of it all made some banking decisions. Sometime that year, as neighbouring Egypt and Syria withered in the face of momentous civil protests, King Abdullah II of Jordan opened two new accounts with Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank that had discreetly served the region’s well-heeled for decades. Abdullah, one of the world’s longest-serving current monarchs, had chosen a banker that shared his approach to secrecy, particularly surrounding his personal wealth. Over the next five years, the king was the beneficial owner of at least six accounts with Credit Suisse, while his wife, Queen Rania, had another. According to a massive trove of data leaked from the bank that names both royals as account holders, one account would later be worth a remarkable 230m Swiss francs (£180m). And here’s an explainer: What is the Suisse secrets leak and why are we publishing it? It’s not quite enough to break the record set over Christmas.

Moscow has dampened expectations for a summit between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden. Putin’s spokesman Dmitri Peskov said it’s “premature” to talk about specific plans for a summit between the Russian president and his American counterpart. Peskov said Putin and Biden could meet if they consider it necessary, but emphasised that “it’s premature to talk about specific plans for a summit” and no concrete plans were in place.

Growth picked up especially in the service sector, though manufacturers also reported better production gains as a result of rising demand and fewer supply bottlenecks.  However, while an easing of supply delays helped to reduce raw material input cost inflation, persistent cost pressures caused by rising wages and energy bills led to the sharpest rise in average prices charged for goods and services in the survey’s history. Price rises in the service sector hit a record high while those in manufacturing rose at a near-record rate. By country, the biggest bounceback was in France, where growth reached the highest since last June, though growth in Germany also picked up to the fastest since last August.

Photograph: Atef SafadiEPAChildren aged 12 to 15 years are to be offered a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine in a bid to reduce infection rates among this age group.The move follows a recommendation by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee\u0026nbsp(Niac), which has been accepted by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly.The go-ahead was given by Niac despite the lack of authorisation by the European Medicines Agency for boosters doses for this age group.The EMA is currently assessing an application by PfizerBioNTech for use of its booster vaccine in adolescents from 12 years.Because off-licence use is being allowed in Ireland, Mr Donnelly said special attention would be paid to the provision of support and guidance information as part of the informed consent process for children and young people and their parents.Niac says a booster dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine should be given at an interval of six months or longer after completion of the primary vaccine series.Where a child in the age group has been infected, the booster dose should be deferred for at least six months following the onset of infection, according to Niac.“In adults, a booster dose with an mRNA vaccine significantly improves protection against severe outcomes, symptomatic diseases and infection from the Omicron variant of Covid-19,” Mr Donnelly said.“Niac have indicated that vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection and hospitalisation was restored to 60-75 per cent and 90 per cent, respectively, two to four weeks after administration of a booster in the adult population.Mr Donnelly cited evidence from Israel’s booster programme showing a significant reduction in the confirmed rate of infection in children and young people aged 12-15 years following the booster dose compared to those of the same age who were vaccinated with the primary series five to six months earlier.“The benefits of vaccination - the prevention of serious illness and death are clear. However, the reduction in rate of infection is important as Ireland removes some of the last public health restrictions in place.The Minister said the Department of Health and the HSE will now work to operationalise the change.

Photograph: iStockA subsidy to help people pay the cost of working in remote hubs is under consideration as the Government explores ways to encourage their use amid average daily costs of between €15 and €20 per day. Minister for Rural Development Heather Humphreys said the Government is looking at options to incentivise the use of hubs which offer office space and high quality broadband connections. She was speaking as she launched an app called Connected Hubs which allows people to book a desk or meeting room at more than 200 of the facilities across the country. Ms Humphreys said the State has invested more than €100 million upgrading former banks, Garda stations and other disused buildings to convert them into remote working hubs.The target is to have 400 hubs by 2025 but Ms Humphreys said she is confident this number will be reached “well in advance of that”. She said: “If Covid-19 has taught us one thing, it’s that the benefits of remote working are huge” and she said the hubs will improve quality of life. “People don’t want to end up spending hours in traffic. They want to spend more time with families and that’s what we want to do – give people a better quality of life and embrace remote working,” Ms Humphreys said.She said the average cost for people using hubs is between €15 and €20 but some charge as little as €10 and booking for a whole week can also see lower costs. Ms Humphreys encouraged people to talk to hub managers about their charges “because they are anxious to do business as well and get more people into their centres”.She also said the Government is working on how their use can be incentivised and said: “Perhaps we can subsidise it initially”, and she suggested it could come in the form of a credit towards the cost.She said her department has funding from Budget 2022 to provide an incentive and said: “It’s not going to be a huge amount, but it will certainly be a help.”Ms Humphreys highlighted how people using hubs don’t have costs such as heating their homes or travel to offices in cities, that there are advantages and “people have to weigh that up”."},{"url":null,"title":"australia fully reopens borders to vaccinated visitors after two years","story":"Australia has fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against the coronavirus after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings.  Video: ReutersA man with a stuffed koala toy and flowers at the arrival hall at the international terminal of Sydney Airport. Photograph: Brent LewinBloombergAustralia on Monday fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against the coronavirus after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings as tourists returned and hundreds of people were reunited with family and friends.More than 50 international flights will reach the country through the day, including 27 touching down in Sydney, its largest city, as the tourism and hospitality sectors look to rebuild after getting hammered by Covid-19 restrictions.“It is a very exciting day, one that I have been looking forward to for a long time, from the day that I first shut that border right at the start of the pandemic,” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters in the island state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on tourism.After being away from loved ones for months there were many emotional reunions, including for Cindy Moss who travelled from the US state of Kentucky to see her daughter.“I just haven’t seen her in so long and it was such a big thing to be able to get over here. So I’m so excited,” she said after hugging her daughter, her voice cracking with emotion.Tourism is one of Australia’s biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion (€38 billion) and employing about 5 per cent of the country’s workforce. But the sector was crippled after the country shut its borders in March 2020.Once a champion of Covid-suppression strategy, Australia shifted away from its fortress-style controls and relentless lockdowns since late last year and began living with the virus after reaching higher vaccination levels. Skilled migrants, international students and backpackers have been allowed to fly into Australia since November in a staggered reopening exercise.PartyingPassengers flying to Sydney were greeted from the air with “Welcome Back World!” painted on a sign near the runways while people in kangaroo costumes welcomed travellers and a DJ played music from a van festooned with a banner saying “You were worth the wait”.“It is a party out here, music playing, smiles on people’s faces, they will be dancing soon, I’m sure,” tourism minister Dan Tehan told broadcaster ABC from Sydney airport as he gave travellers gift jars of Vegemite, an iconic Australian food spread, and stuffed koala toys.Tehan said he was hopeful for a “very strong” rebound in the tourism market, with Qantas looking to fly more than 14,000 passengers into Australia this week.

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPAQueen Elizabeth is experiencing “mild cold like symptoms” after testing positive for Covid-19 but expects to be at her desk carrying out “light duties”, Buckingham Palace has said.Concerns for the queen (95) will be heightened given her age and recent health scare but it appears the head of state is determined to carry out what tasks she can despite contracting the virus.The diagnosis follows a string of Covid cases among Britain’s royal family and the queen’s Windsor Castle team, with the Prince of Wales meeting the monarch the week he tested positive, and the Duchess of Cornwall also isolating after contracting the virus.The announcement was made just a few weeks after Britain’s longest-reigning monarch reached her historic Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne on February 6th.Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “Buckingham Palace confirm that The Queen has today tested positive for Covid.“Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.“She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines.The royal household has its own royal physicians and the queen’s doctors will be on hand to take care of and monitor the head of state, with Professor Sir Huw Thomas, head of the medical household and physician to the queen, expected to be in charge.It is understood the queen is following Covid guidelines on self-isolating after testing positive but prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to repeal all pandemic regulations that restrict public freedoms in England when he lays out his vision for the future on Monday.The queen is believed to be triple vaccinated but until recently had been on doctors’ orders to rest since mid October, after cancelling a run of engagements and spending a night in hospital undergoing preliminary tests.Just a few weeks ago, the monarch had begun to resume her normal duties, hosting at Sandringham her largest reception in months, on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee anniversary, and a few days later held her first in-person audience with the prime minister in many weeks.The queen is believed to have spent time with Charles, Prince of Wales, on February 8, when he hosted an investiture at her Windsor Castle home, and a few days later he tested positive for Covid but made a quick recovery to full health.Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has also tested positive for Covid, with Clarence House confirming on February 14th that the duchess was self isolating. – PAEverything you need

I see people wearing them outdoors, when walking alone, even in a 100mph gale – and two-thirds of Britons want restrictions to stay. So, here’s my question to Boris Johnson: how do you persuade a society that you have terrified and infantilised for two years that it is safe to go back into the water?We can protect you from death itself. A storm is treated not for what it is - weather - but the end of the world, government advice being to chain yourself to the heaviest object in the house and watch your live-stream of ITN journalists spinning off Brighton pier into the sea. Later I went for a nice walk. The man I encountered, gamely sweeping up the debris because “the council will never do it”, was the real hero of that day.There is a theory among some Conservatives that we need to let the public run their little simulation of socialism and see them learn the hard way that it doesn’t work, that taxes and inflation, and cultural stagnation, are the result. The downside is the wiser minority has to accompany them on this journey.Moreover, why should we have to endure this graceless slide into authoritarianism when we’ve got a Tory government with a large majority, supposedly on our side? The sheer passivity of the Conservative Party is a wonder to behold. They act as if problems are nothing to do with them (“the NHS is in a terrible state you know”) and robbing you to fix things is logical, even when, in the case of your energy bill, the state created said problem the first place and is now lending you your own money to fix it. Which we know it won’t.The “living with Covid strategy” will fail if it is limited purely to lifting the architecture of pandemic restrictions. Boris is going to have to use his talents to promote liberty, and call out organisations, from schools to supermarkets, that drag their feet on the road to reopening.

We want to explore these untold stories and celebrate the people and places at the heart of our history.In 2020, a Historic England strategy document called for action to ensure a more erse range of people able to connect with, enjoy and benefit from the historic environment and said it aimed to target priority audiences from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds.Now it has devised new pilot grants that will highlight overlooked historic places, with a particular interest in recognising and celebrating working class histories.Projects funded by the grants could include conservation work, exhibitions, education programmes or community areas centred on historic sites such as old factories or railways.Historic England bosses are keen for projects to encourage volunteering and be community-led, allowing people to tell their own stories about their local areas.Nigel Huddleston, the heritage minister, backed the plans and said: Our heritage belongs to us all and should be accessible to everyone. I welcome plans for new community-led projects to tell the story of working people across the country, bringing our collective and shared history back to life.Historic England has previously worked to elevate sites linked to more everyday aspects of history. Salford Lads Club, an Edwardian club set up to keep young men off the streets, and the Byker Wall housing estate in Newcastle have recently been listed.A £93 million budget has also been allocated for the rejuvenation of historic high streets across England, including in traditionally working class areas such as Sunderland, Stoke-on-Trent and Grimsby.The deadline for applications for the everyday heritage grants is May 23.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid standoff over Covid testing delays Cabinet meetingRussia-Ukraine crisis: Five Ukrainian \u0026#39saboteurs\u0026#39 who attempted to cross border killed, Kremlin claimsMinisters to reject making misogyny a hate crimeLiving with Covid plan: What rule-free Britain will look like after legal restrictions endStorm Franklin latest: Thousands of homes still without power as third storm delays relief effort When will free Covid lateral flow tests end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jimi hendrixs handwritten lyrics tore apart 55 years ago pieced","story":"A page of Jimi Hendrix\u0027s handwritten lyrics have been pieced together after 55 years after being torn apart to provide autographs for British schoolgirls.Before a gig in Bath in 1967, the rock and roll icon was approached backstage by two teenage fans who asked for an autograph, but he had no paper to sign his name.Hendrix tore a page out of an exercise book used to scribble down his lyrics, ripped the paper in two, and signed both halves to provide an autograph each for the girls.The torn document spent 55 years in two pieces as the friends who saw Hendrix together drifted apart, but the girls preserved their respective fragments, and they have now been pierced together as memorabilia store Tracks prepares the piece for auctionTracks expert Paul Wane said the item was one of the “extremely few Jimi Hendrix manuscripts in existence”.On one side the fragment carries the signatures of Hendrix and the two other members of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, and on the other the beginnings of a song.Headed “51st Wedding Anniversary” the handwritten lyrics also bear the note “Key of B”. Just weeks after Hendrix met the teenage fans, and despite tearing out his lyrics, 51st Anniversary was released as B-side to Purple Haze.One of the fans who approached Hendrix in 1967 contacted memorabilia experts Tracks about her half of the fragment, and the company managed to track down the owner of the other half, who had also preserved her memento from the gig five decades earlier.The repaired manuscript is now expected to achieve a five-figure sum at auctionHendrix was known to keep notebooks handy for his lyrics, and scribbled on hotel stationary and napkins when inspiration struck. The singer and guitarist wrote more than 100 songs before his death at 27 in 1970. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Five Ukrainian \u0026#39saboteurs\u0026#39 who attempted to cross border killed, Kremlin claimsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid standoff over Covid testing delays Cabinet meetingMinisters to reject making misogyny a hate crimeLiving with Covid plan: What rule-free Britain will look like after legal restrictions endStorm Franklin latest: Thousands of homes still without power as third storm delays relief effort When will free Covid lateral flow tests end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kremlin may not interested dialogue","story":"This matters because some European leaders remain of the view that a diplomatic settlement can be achieved.

We’re certainly not asking people to throw caution to the winds. Covid remains a dangerous disease, particularly if you haven’t been vaccinated.Blanket lockdown regulations will also be replaced by a requirement on local authorities to manage outbreaks through planning and pre-existing public health powers, as they would with other diseases.Mr Johnson said: I don’t want to go back to that kind of non-pharmaceutical intervention and want to be able to address the problems of the pandemic with a vaccine-led approach.But he refused to rule out reintroducing restrictions in the face of a new variant in the future. You’ve got to be humble in the face of nature, he said.Travel tests and red tape will remain despite the relaxation of domestic restrictions.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and pay for a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK.All travellers – jabbed and unjabbed – will also have to continue to fill in the passenger locator form (PLF) to enter the UK to the anger of many in the travel industry and Tory MPs who have campaigned for frictionless travel.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is expected to announce long-term plans for travel in the next month, which could see the PLF further streamlined, the scrapping of hotel quarantine for red list countries and measures to prevent a return to on-off border closures.Mr Shapps has been working with other countries to draw up a playbook of rules to deal with new virus strains so that action can be taken without shutting frontiers.He said that this will help us to ensure that, rather than having to shut down, we can put measures in place that are internationally agreed if required.Face masks are no longer compulsory except on the London Underground and other means of public transport in the capital. There is no legal obligation to wear them in shops.Instead, it will be left up to companies and iniduals to decide the approach they adopt, which means that companies, theatres and shops could still request that they should be worn by their employees and customers.A government source said it was likely we won\u0027t be explicit on the approach businesses should take to masks. They added: We are now in a world where we\u0027re moving away from Government diktat to personal judgement and responsibility.It is thought likely that ministers will still suggest that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces, where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet in order to minimise the risk of infection.Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate with the Medical Research Council (MRC) at the University of Cambridge, urged vulnerable people to wear good quality surgical masks. Hospitals are still likely to limit visits as the Government’s new living with Covid plans will leave it up to inidual trusts to decide their own policies.More than a quarter of NHS trusts have suspended routine hospital visits completely, and in some cases relatives are being prevented from seeing non-Covid patients for weeks at a time.NHS England encourages trusts to facilitate visits wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way, but it is up to inidual trusts to set their own policies based on UK Health Security Agency guidelines.Analysis by The  found that at least 34 hospital trusts across England still have routine visits suspended, with exceptions such as those for patients receiving end-of-life care and people with dementia.All 125 trusts have some form of visiting restriction in place. The most common policy is to have one named visitor per patient for the entirety of a patient’s stay, who can only visit for one hour once a dayThe over-75s and those who are clinically vulnerable are expected to be given a fourth coronavirus jab within weeks.The elderly and those who have immuno-suppressant conditions will be offered another booster jab as it is six months since many had their third jab last autumn.Mr Johnson is expected to leave open the prospect that further Covid jabs could be given, saying he will be guided by the expert vaccine body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, chair of the JCVI, has said that fourth Covid jabs should not be offered until there is more evidence, as giving boosters to people every six months was not sustainable.In an interview with The  last month, he said the UK needed to target the vulnerable in future, rather than giving boosters to all over-12s.Mr Johnson repeated his plea for anyone who was not fully vaccinated to get their jab, saying Covid remained dangerous if you are vulnerable or not vaccinated. There are still people who have not been properly vaccinated or had their booster. There is no place for complacency about this, he said.Mass testing in schools is also expected to end at the beginning of April in tandem with the shift from the provision of universal free tests for Covid, saving the Treasury a significant slice from the current £2billion a month cost of the testing programme.It is understood ministers are considering contingency supplies of free tests for schools if they have Covid outbreaks. The requirement for face coverings to be worn in classrooms and communal areas was lifted last month as part of the updates to Plan B.But Mr Johnson faces a union backlash from Unison, Unite and the GMB, which represent school support staff, and they are urging him to keep in place free testing and the requirement to self-isolate.The three unions warned that the failure to provide clear, detailed guidance risked a “super spreader free-for-all” in schools and other workplaces. If remaining safety rules are axed, schools will be left in an “impossible situation”, the unions added.Parents will be unsure about whether to send their children into school, transmission rates could soar and new, more potent variants could emerge, they warned.This article is being kept updated with the latest news and advice. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid standoff over Covid testing delays Cabinet meetingRussia-Ukraine crisis: Five Ukrainian \u0026#39saboteurs\u0026#39 who attempted to cross border killed, Kremlin claimsMinisters to reject making misogyny a hate crimeStorm Franklin latest: Thousands of homes still without power as third storm delays relief effort When will free Covid lateral flow tests end in the UK?Met Police officers who allegedly shared offensive messages with Wayne Couzens namedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"obsessed history become oblivious modern genocide","story":"The debate over the future of Tobias Rustat\u0027s memorial at Jesus College Cambridge is an important one, for it perfectly illustrates the growing split between those who claim to be offended by the past and wish to cancel it and those who believe we should live with the past and learn from it. No sensible person doubts the fact that slavery was abominable. The question here is whether attempts to cancel any reference to historical figures who had links, however tenuous, to the slave trade does anything to change our actions today. Removing a memorial, whether it be to Rhodes in Oxford or Rustat in Cambridge, might allow us to feel better about ourselves for a fleeting moment, but does it change us for the better? The evidence, I\u0027m afraid, is that it doesn\u0027t. Look, for instance, at our response to the actions of the Chinese Communist Party, which is committing crimes against humanity today, rather than hundreds of years ago. A recent tribunal report, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice, concluded that the President Xi’s government was guilty of widespread, systematic attacks against the Uyghur people, which amounted to genocide. This involves slave labour on an industrial scale.Collectively, Cambridge and Imperial College have taken many tens of millions in Chinese money since 2015, and this is without factoring in the fees paid by inidual Chinese students. At the same time, some of the academics at Jesus College stand accused of dismissing criticisms of the Chinese government\u0027s human rights record.Other British universities including Nottingham, Queen Mary, and Liverpool, have opened branches, campuses, and joint-ventures in China. It has been reported that that some of the teaching in such institutions takes place under the supervision of the Chinese Ministry of Education, and that some degrees require students to take mandatory courses in the philosophy of Chairman Mao. In the last five years alone, academics at British universities have jointly published over 10,000 papers, articles and books with academics at Chinese universities with the closest ties to the Chinese military and security apparatus. Westminster University\u0027s China Media Centre has made a healthy return training future Communist Party propagandists on how to navigate the European press. Around ten universities – including Imperial College, UCL, Sheffield, Manchester, and Liverpool – earned more than a quarter of their fees from Chinese students. In 2020, figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that our universities earned some £7bn from fees alone.It seems that the more we obsess over memorials, the more we miss the lessons of history. We should focus our efforts on learning from people like Olaudah Equiano, Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce, who believed slavery to be a monstrosity and in their day were determined to stamp it out through boycotts and other means. They took action to counter inhumane acts – as we should do today.  Our universities remain shackled to a country practicing systematic slave labour and genocide, while our Government talks of deepening trade ties with China, British businesses utilise supply chains containing slave labour, and some British banks act as apologists for the CCP. When future generations look back, what will they make of this bizarre paradox in which we argue passionately about past atrocities while ignoring those occurring live, before our eyes? It’s surely not plaques and statues that matter but the lives of people who suffer under the yoke of such brutality. For unless we apply the lessons of the past to change the future, trying to cancel the past surely becomes as bad as ignoring it.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid

Hands said that 32,000 households across the UK have yet to have their power restored as Storm Franklin caused widespread flooding and travel disruption on Monday morning.He said: Overall, across the UK 1.3 million homes have had their power restored.There are still around 32,000 homes as of this morning that have yet to have their power restored, about 12,000 in the UK Power Network Area, which covers the South East of England and East Anglia.Asked why it was taking days to bring back power, he said: Partly because there\u0027s been follow-up storms - we\u0027ve had Storm Franklin, which has inhibited some of the relief effort and some of the efforts to get people their power back.This comes as train operators issued \u0027Do not travel\u0027 warnings this morning as many services were paralysed by gale-force winds and lashing rain. The Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for Northern Ireland and a milder yellow wind warning for much of the rest of the UK as Storm

operators urging passengers to avoid travelling as services are expected to be paralysed by gale-force winds and lashing rain.National Rail has warned anyone making essential journeys to expect major disruption to routes across most of Great Britain - including cancellations, delays and slower speeds onboard.Damage from fallen trees, flying debris and trampolines from Storm Eunice had already caused chaos across much of the rail network. South Western Railway said Network Rail have cleared more than 50 trees from its network since Friday, but more heavy rain and strong winds on Sunday night caused even more trees to block the lines and further damage to stations and infrastructure.A spokesman added: With the wind direction expected to change it is very likely that more trees will come down during Storm Franklin, having been weakened over the last two days.Energy minister Greg Hands said lessons will be learned for the energy network after the three storms to hit to UK in the past week.He said: What we do after each storm is we have a lessons learned process, both the Department for Business and Ofgem, the regulator.Quite often very significant lessons do get learned: the 105 emergency number for power outages was a lesson learned from a previous storm.He added that power outages were a horrible thing to happen to households.I admire the resilience that people have shown, I admire the incredible efforts being put in by engineers and other support workers, both here locally and across the UK.A lot of help comes in across the UK when these events happen, a lot of

It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

We are also ready to impose swt and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. The Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Biden could set up a call or meeting at any time but there were no firm plans yet for a summit.  It comes following a flurry of late-night calls between French President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin. Mr Macronaposs office and the White House said details of a possible summit could be hammered out during a meeting on Thursday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The development offers a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution but Western leaders still fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent.More than , Russian troops are massed around Ukraineaposs borders, according to US estimates, with , along the countryaposs eastern flank and tens of thousands alongside Belarusian troops in the north.Fears have been mounting that Russia will stage  flag attacks to justy further aggression against Ukraine. A UK source told the Mirror that they believed an invasion was going to happen in the next  to  hours.  Boris Johnson warned at the weekend that Europe could be on the brink of the biggest war since  as he travelled to Munich for a crunch security conference.In a call with Mr Macron on Sunday night, the Prime Minister welcomed the prospect of a diplomatic solution and urged Mr Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine’s border. A No spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister noted that President Putin’s commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution. The Prime Minister stressed that Ukraine’s voice must be central in any discussions. Tory Minister Paul Scully said there were , more Russian troops on the Ukrainian border than there were a few days ago despite the Russians trying to signal the fact they were pulling away from the border.He told Sky News: There is a very, very credible threat and thataposs why weaposve got to continue to be vigilant, weaposve got to continue to work with Ukraine and Poland, as Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, was doing just this week. He warned the loss of le will be horrendousRussian fails to engage in diplomacy. Mr Scully denied that Mr Macron had been more effective in tackling the Ukraine crisis than the Prime Minister, saying Mr Johnson had been on the front foot in addressing the rising tensions. Itaposs important that every member of Nato collaborate and work together, as they are, to make sure that Vladimir Putin realises that he needs to go down the diplomatic route and retreat from the border, he told TALKRadio.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace will take questions in the Commons on Monday afternoon.Russia and ally Belarus said they were extending war games on Belarusian territory that would offer a convenient staging post on Ukrainian capital Kyiv, less than  miles south of the border with Belarus.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

The massive Volvo digger is stuck precariously sinking into the water, as police cordon the area off to prevent any accidents.As the country is battered by its third storm in the space of a week, Brits are more than used to blustery winds and torrential rain this February. This has included a record mph winds and conditions that tragically led to four deaths so far.Trains have been cancelled and countless damage done through debris and falling trees. Now, on top of that, new footage shows a massive digger and the  it was once on, stuck in the river. As the digger sank into the river, the surrounding  and all the equipment was stuck underwater too.  Riverbanks across the country have burst their banksapos thanks to the three successive storms that saw localised flooding across the UK. The footage, filmed on a drone, shows the destruction it has wrought in Leeds. It also shows a police presence around the area and all they can do is watch as the digger is beyond saving. The water rushes over it, through the cabin where a driver once sat.  River defences prevent the water from spilling out and bursting its banks thankfully as dozens of cars and buildings are only a few metres away. This all comes as Storm Franklin hit the UK on Sunday night and is forecast to remain through midday on Monday. Following on from Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice, Franklin is set to bring torrential rain and strong winds to parts of the UK. After red weather warnings which saw record mph winds and tragically five Brits die as a result, Franklin is set to be less disruptive than the previous two storms.The latest storm will affect the UK from midday Sunday into early afternoon Monday. Environment agencies have also issued hundreds of alerts for flooding across the UK, including two severe warnings where rainfall could cause a danger to le for communities along the River Mersey in Greater Manchester.

However, sheaposs now tested positive for the virus and is isolating at Windsor Castle.In keeping with her normal business as usual approach, the -year-old intends to carry out light duties while she isolates in line with government guidelines. Fortunately, the Queen has been fully-vaccinated and Buckingham Palace said yesterday she was suffering only mild symptoms.But at the start of the pandemic in March  when little was known about the virus and no vaccines were available, a protective bubble was thrown around the Queen and the now late Prince Philip in a bid to stop them from contracting Covid.It saw around  royal staff sacricing their home lives to stay isolated at Windsor in order to assist the Queen during lockdown.The group was christened aposHMS Bubbleapos, a joke the Queen and Prince Philip were said to find very amusing, by Vice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt, master of the household. In an email to staff, the former naval officer likened their situation to being out at sea. He wrote: “There are  Royal Household staff inside the Bubble, and it struck me that our predicament is not dissimilar to my former le in the Royal Navy on a long overseas deployment. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .“Indeed, the challenges that we are facing, whether self-isolating alone at home, or with our close household and families, have parallels with being at sea, away from home for many months, and having to deal with a sense of dislocation, anxiety and uncertainty. In April last year, when Prince Philip died aged , HMS Bubble was still in place and the close aides who isolated at Windsor are said to have been a source of support to her. Among those closest to her, thereported, were her senior dresser Angela Kelly, head groom, Terry Pendry, private secretary Sir Edward Young and page of the backstairs, Paul Whybrew. However, with almost no Covid restrictions in place in England and members of the Royal Family, including the Queen, now conducting face-to-face duties, a source told the Daily Mail that HMS Bubble had been relaxed of late.The explained: Itaposs bubble-ish. If you are going to the castle or coming into direct contact with the Queen then you are required to test but, in general, restrictions are clearly not as rigorous as they were this time a year or  months ago.Meanwhile, royal expert Roya Nikkhah told the BBC Radio aposs Today programme that the Queen herself understood HMS wasnapost tenable for the future.She said: There has been a lot of talk about this HMS Bubble around the Queen for a couple of years which has been very successful, but I think long term the Queen understood more than anyone it wasnapost tenable to continue.  aposIt placed a huge demand on pressures on staff who had to isolate and be away from their families for a long time. aposSo I think she was very sanguine about that and probably inevitably accepted that she might be at risk at some point, but fingers crossed sheaposll be well – sheaposs triple-vaxxed – and carry on. Itaposs believed the Queenaposs Covid diagnosis came after a number of her team have also been hit by the virus. But Buckingham Palace has said the monarch expects to be at her desk continuing light duties over the coming days.The Queen holds an audience with Boris Johnson most Wednesdays, either in person or by telephone, and has recently been holding one or two diplomatic audiences a week with ambassadors by video-link, and is likely to do so this weekwell enough.She will also be given a digest of the day’s news from the early-morning radio and television bulletins, and a selection of papers, with her photo gracing most of the front pages after the announcement that she has Covid.Her diagnosis follows a string of cases among the royal family, with the Prince of Wales meeting his mother in the week he tested positive, and the Duchess of Cornwall also isolating after contracting the virus.The monarch, who for almost two years avoided contracting Covid, has served as a symbol of national stability during the pandemic, delivering two rare televised addresses to the nation weeks apart.

Prince Charles is rarely seen touching his we Camilla, and the Cambridges have strict aposon-dutyapos behaviour. But when Prince William tried a rare PDA during the coupleaposs appearance on Mary Berryaposs A Berry Royal Christmas back in  - it was well and truly shot down. In fact, some viewers described the moment as extremely awkward and said Kate recoiled from her husbandaposs touch - however others praised her for trying to keep things professional and trying to avoid stealing the show.The moment occurred as the couple sat down to speak to charity volunteers at a Christmas party, which was being catered by former Great British Bake Off judge Mary. Twitter users picked up on Kateaposs reaction to Williamaposs touch.One wrote: Awkward! Too awkward!! They should have cut it out. Another said Kate aposmoved with a quicknessapos after her husband reached out for her. A third person commented: Kate shaking off Williamaposs hand on her shoulder during #ABerryRoyalChristmas. One royal watcher said she reacts the same way when her mum touches her shoulder because it makes her feel uncomfortable. However, others insisted people had misinterpreted the behaviour. One fan tweeted: LOOK WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Kate is beautully content as William’s hand rests on her shoulder. FIRST William STARTS to remove his hand, AFTER Kate simply shts. Another person commented: I like the way they interact, it’s professional. I don’t want to see excessive hand holding and back rubbing. It’s awkward, like you’re intruding on a private moment. Another said: I think he tickled her back or shoulder. She did move but there were no dirty looks or even a facial reaction. Over the years Kate and William have shared some PDAs, which always delight fans. Their engagement and th anniversary official photos show them cuddling tightly together and looking lovingly into each others eyes.Behind-the-scenes photos from Williamaposs Earthshot Prize Ceremony show Kate placing her hand on her husbandaposs back, and she had her hand on his knee in their  Christmas card.When Meghan Markle joined the family, Prince Harry raised some eyebrows by taking a much less formal approach to joint engagements. They loved-up couple held hands throughout their outings and couldnapost keep their hands off each other.But the majority of people loved the intimacy of it, describing it as a refreshing approach to royal le and sharing their happiness.

Ellen said: So you went with Harry to a Halloween party and they had no idea it was the two of you  Meghan confirmed this, saying: It was a post-apocalypse theme, so we had all this very bizarre costuming on, and we were able to just have one fun final night out. But it was this night that Prince Harry received a call that would change their relationship forever.In an unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors said the pair were having the perfect night out - until they received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. The couple were told that the press had discovered they were dating. The next day, their relationship would be announced all over the world. So, the Halloween party was the last opportunity that Meghan and Harry would be able to celebrate their relationship privately.It appears Eugenie has remained close to Harry following his and Meghanaposs choice to stand down from the royal family, as they were seen together at the Super Bowl in the US last week. The royal pair were pictured together in the stands - although were without Meghan and Eugenieaposs husband Jack. According to royal expert and biographer Duncan Larcombe, Eugenie publicly supporting Harry at the Super Bowl shows she is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals. He told OK!: The royals have stayed quite consistent and firm when it comes to Harry and Meghan, as we’ve seen. Eugenie is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals by being seen so publicly to endorse Harry and Meghan in their new le. It endorses what they said about the royals. There are those that think that Eugenie is Harry’s only hope of him being brought back in should things not work out in paradise, so at least he is talking to someone in the Royal Family. By seeing Eugenie there, it looks like the only link he still has with his family.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The warnings were not empty, with at least four people dead and widespread damage caused - including part of the roof of the O Arena being ripped off. While not accompanied by red warnings, Franklin too promises to cause signicant disruption despite the ongoing recovery from last weekaposs storms. Homes have already been evacuated in some parts of the country, while scores of flood alerts have been issued in the north.What will the next storm be called  The Met Office Storm Centre has named the next storm after Franklin as ‘Gladys’.After Storm Gladys, the following storms will be named: Herman, Imani, Jack, Kim, Logan, Méabh, Nasim, Olwen, Pól, Ruby, Seán, Tineke, Vergil and Willemien. When is Storm Gladys expected  Storms are named when a weather event is picked up by the National Severe Weather Warnings service. At this point, the service hasn’t named Gladys so it is too early to tell when orthe storm will hit the UK Despite Storm Franklin currently gripping the UK, there are some concerns that windy weather on Thursday could end up being named as Gladys, BirminghamLive reports.The Met Office has already said that three storms arriving in such quick succession as we have had in the past few days is incredibly rare, and so it remains to be seen whether a fourth manests. How does the Met Office name its storms   The forecaster encourages people to send in names for storms, which they then choose the best of to reflect the ersity of the UK. The list of names is alphabetical, with a new list being introduced each year at the beginning of September. Storms warrant a name depending on both the severity of a weather event and the likelihood of it actually taking place. The Met Office say: A storm will be named when it has the potential to cause an amber or red warning. Other weather types will also be considered, specically rainits impact could lead to flooding as advised by the Environment Agency, SEPA and Natural Resources Wales flood warnings. Therefore aposstorm systemsapos could be named on the basis of impacts from the wind but also include the impacts of rain and snow.

Rats are excellent swimmers with bendy bones and can squeeze into the smallest of spaces. “They can hold their breath for three minutes and tread water for three days, and they are coming up waste pipes.  “They’re cunning and getting bolder and bolder. Basically,they want to get into your home, they will.” The explosion in UK rat numbers is causing chaos. They are said to number  million – the most ever. Mr Helands continued: “This has increased by % each year over the Covid pandemic. “People are scared and they should be. There are more rats than ever and they are taking over. I have seen some the size of cats.”  He said that the increase in numbers of people working from home means rats don’t have as much food to eat in city centres – so they are coming into homes instead. Two weeks ago, it was reported how bin-men were being attacked by rats. In some areas binmen are banging bins before emptying amid fears of being scratched or bitten. Mr Helands, who runs Sussex pest control business Pests Be Gone continued: “There are ways of pest proofing your home. “You can get rat gates for water pipes – these used to be used in very rural areas, such as near canals, but now we are recommending them even in built-up housing areas.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Giant rats\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

During the peak of the killer storm which took at least four lives in the UK, a pilot had to battle record winds and blustery conditions to reach the tarmac.Flying a Boeing  aeroplane, one captain nailed the landing despite the rocky conditions. Captain of Qatar plane, Khala Al-Thani managed to land the world’s largest twinjet craft at Heathrow Airport despite the recording breaking winds the storm brought. Flying into the UK on Friday, February , the pilot caught it all on camera from inside his own cockpit. The footage shows the pilot constantly adjusting and readjusting the plane’s path as it approaches the runway.  Thanks to the blustery wind, to keep the craft level the pilot can be seen constantly checking his readouts inside the cockpit.Alongside the internal footage showing the pilot, a stream from Big Jet TV shows the outside of the plane as it comes into land.The independent YouTube channel shot to viral fame during Storm Eunice as it filmed planes coming into land at Heathrow during the high winds. Viewers flocked to the channel to see the dramatic commentary as plane enthusiast Jerry Dyer filmed the planes coming into land. Reaching over , people at its peak, the channel became an unlikely star of the storm.  Dyer can be heard commentating as the Qatar plane comes into land, gasping as the plane flexes in the wind - a purposeful design feature. In spite of the blustery conditions and record high winds recorded during the storm, the pilot landed the plane fine. This comes as the UK was battered by three storms in one week, with Storm Franklin following on from Storms Dudley and Eunice. Record mph winds were felt as four people tragically died from accidents involving debris and falling trees.  This morning, the country woke up to severe flooding in many parts of the North West, with over  Manchester residents forced to evacuate their houses in the early hours of the morning as the River Mersey burst its banks.Despite the severe conditions, the worst of Storm Franklin is thought to be behind us, with the BBC reporting most areasapos storm peak coming last night into early this morning. The Met Office said that as the day goes on conditions will settle towards and beyond midday.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeHeathrow AirportStormsPlanes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Christopher Tunniclfe says the tiles were ripped off, leaving his roof badly damaged and a car windscreen was broken by flying debris in the residential street in Derby.The -year-old told Derbyshire Live : “I was just waking up at about pm because I’d finished my night sht, I was sat up in bed and my partner came running up the stairs and opened the window and said ‘look at the weather ’.“It was really windy, and the next thing there was this massive rush of wind, the trees were almost horizontal and the house shook. “It made the most horrendous howling noise, it was really surreal, I really did think the house was going to fall down.”  After what they believe was a tornado passed through the street, residents came out onto the road to assess the damage. The wind left Mr Tunniclfeaposs roof badly damaged, removing some of the tiles and breaking his car windscreen. He added that around five houses on the street had been damaged by the strong winds. He added: “It took a load of the tiles off and scattered them on the driveway and smashed my car windows. “The tiles also landed on next door’s property as well. My partner had just put some recycling out sohe had been a few seconds later, all that rubble could have been on top of him.“It’s left me a bit scared because we’ve got this storm kicking off now and I’m worried the damage could get even worse.” Luckily no-one was hurt but Mr Tunniclfe did add that the people on his road helped everyone out and made the best of a bad situation.

After red weather warnings which saw record mph winds and tragically five Brits die as a result, Franklin is set to be less disruptive than the previous two storms. The latest storm will affect the UK from midday Sunday into early afternoon Monday. Environment agencies have also issued hundreds of alerts for flooding across the UK, including two severe warnings where rainfall could cause a danger to le for communities along the River Mersey in Greater Manchester. Storm Dudley also hit parts of the UK last week and meteorologist Becky Mitchell said three named storms in such quick succession is a first since the system was introduced seven years ago.  She told the PA news agency: This is the first time we have had three named storms within a week, and we started the storm naming system in . At the moment weaposve got a really active jet stream, which is why weaposre seeing so many storms track right towards the UK. We had Dudley on Wednesday, Eunice on Friday and Franklin today.  Ms Mitchell said there will definitely be some impact from Storm Franklin but it is not expected to be as severe as Eunice because the strongest winds will be confined to the coast. On Sunday, all of Wales, Northern Ireland and much of the UK from Manchester southwards is covered by a yellow wind weather warning. The Met Office has said this could damage properties and cause power cuts as well as disrupt travel plans.The same parts of the country including the North West, East Midlands, West Midlands, South West, South East, and London will all see the same wind warning remain in place from midday Sunday to early afternoon Monday. Only the northeast will escape the effects of Storm Franklin, and winds of up to mph in coastal areas and mph inland in England and Wales. Then on Monday, an amber wind warning will be in place for northern areas of Northern Ireland. This means winds in excess of mph could be felt in coastal areas, with gusts up to mph inland. FORECASTED TIMINGS FOR STORM FRANKLINAccording to BBC Weather, the strongest gales will impact the following towns and cities beginning at these times: Derby - pm Leicester - pm Nottingham - pm Cambridge - pm Luton - pm Hertfordshire - pm Suffolk - pm Peterborough - London - pm Buckinghamshire - pm Brighton - pmSouthampton - pm Reading - pm Manchester - am Blackpool - pm Warrington - pm Bristol - pm Cornwall - pm Swindon - pm Plymouth - pm The worst of the weather will be felt late into Sunday night and early on Monday morning. Storm Franklin will move eastwards from north Scotland from early Monday morning but is expected to reach the North Sea and clear land before midday. The worst of the wind will be felt on the storm’s southern flank, but the high winds will continue to be felt for most of Monday. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Andy Page said: “Following the signicant impacts of Storm Eunice on Friday, Storm Franklin will bring further high winds for many late on Sunday and into Monday, although not on the same scale as Eunice.  “Coastal areas of Northern Ireland, especially on that north coast, will get the strongest wind gusts, which could be around mph in a few places. “Amber and yellow wind warnings have been issued, and people should remain cautious ahead of the system that will bring -mph wind gusts for much of the UK from late on Sunday and through Monday.” Snow is also a possibility in parts of Scotland and north England late Sunday into Monday, particularly on high ground.  RAC Breakdown Spokesman Rod Dennis said: “Drivers will be glad to see the back of Storm Eunice but it looks like conditions on the roads will remain challenging right through the weekend. With winds still strong and gusty, it’s important drivers don’t take any chances, so we urge them to slow down and leave plenty of space between themselves and the vehicle in front. “It’s not just strong winds that they’ll need to contend with – on Sunday intense rainfall becomes a feature making driving arduous. If conditions get particularly bad again, people should consider postponing their journeys, and for those who have to drive, it’s vital they keep their wits about them at all times.” People are advised to check their local resilience authorities for ongoing safety advice around travel and preparations.

Many of those services which weren’t preemptively cancelled have been by blocked or flooded tracks and roads.As well as the yellow weather warning which remains across the UK until midday today, more than  flood warnings and alerts were issued.This included two severe flood warnings where there was a risk to le on the River Mersey in East Didsbury and at West Didsbury and Northenden. Rain was so bad overnight, that some parts of Manchester began evacuating people, with over  homes at risk as the River Mersey burst its banks. Have you been hammered by Storm Franklin  Email webnews@mirror  Shortly after am this morning, Councillor Bev Craig, Leader of Manchester City Council said the “process of evacuation was already underway.“We’re working closely with the police, fire service and the Environment Agency to protect residents living in the areas where we have severe flood warnings.The process of evacuation is already under way in order to protect as many people as possible given the forecast of more heavy rain throughout the day.”  Manchester and Derbyshire were some of the areas worst affected by the flooding as local rivers burst their banks and streets were flooded. Matlock, Derbyshire, was described as having had its streets in the town centre turned into a river. Such was the chaos caused on our roads and rail lines that train providers took the drastic action over advising Brits against using them, with some going as far as telling Brits to simply not travel today.  CrossCounty Trains said: “We are strongly recommending not to travel today. “Storms over the past week will have tested the infrastructure and with Storm Franklin today, we will have severe disruption across our network.” Meanwhile, National Rail asked customers to “avoid travelpossible” on Monday and South Western Railway issued a do not travel message after “a series of further incidents caused by high winds on Sunday evening”.  National Rail said the first services on most routes were cancelled, while there is a reduced timetable for Monday, alternative travel is unavailable and further disruption is expected. Major flooding across parts of Yorkshire has blocked multiple lines and shuttered South Yorkshireaposs Rotherham Central railway station until Tuesday. Rail operator TransPennine Express told customers on Twitter : Due to a river flooding the railway at Mexborough, trains are currently unable to operate between Doncaster, Meadowhall and Sheffield. All lines are blocked. In the capital, where wind gusts are up to around mph, London Overground services are cancelled or reduced. Roads across the country have been shut thanks to the high winds and torrential rain, whether because of debris like trees knocked over, or flooding carriageways.An Amber Warning for wind on Northern Ireland expired at am this morning and winds will peak during rush hour according to to Greg Dewhurst, senior meteorologist at the Met Office. He added that conditions will noticeably ease around lunchtime. The heavy showers that lashed northern England and Northern Ireland are set to move south-east he added and around midday, the Met Office removed a number of flood warnings. Storm Franklinaposs highest gust of mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Sunday evening, followed by current gusts of mph on a mountaintop in Wales.  Itaposs still pretty strong out there and it will continue to be strong over the next few hours, Mr Dewhurst told the PA news agency. Thousands of homes in the UK are still without power due to Storm Eunice, and Storm Franklin is complicating recovery efforts. This came after huge waves were seen crashing on to coastal areas, homes were destroyed by strong winds, and emergency services deployed flood defences along swelling riverbanks on Sunday.  Colossal waves have been captured engulfing Newhaven lighthouse in West Quay, East Sussex, and Porthcawl Lighthouse in Bridgend, Wales. The River Don burst its banks in the Sprotbrough area of Doncaster in South Yorkshire on Sunday night, and police have warned people to stay away from dangerous fast-flowing water. South Yorkshire Police said: We ask people to remain away from the area of Sprotbrough Falls and Sprotbrough Lock in Doncaster, after the River Don burst its banks in this location earlier this evening. Many of the footpaths in this area are presently under water. The water is fast-flowing and poses a risk to people attempting to wade through it. Members of the public are being asked to remain away from the area at this time for their own safety. Thank you. Central Sheffieldaposs flood defences appear to have held, despite fears as the River Don raged through the city on Sunday night. Last week marked the first time three named storms have been recorded within seven days since the storm-naming system began in , with Dudley, Eunice and Franklin.

But neighbours in the apartment block say the woman owed thousands of pounds in rent and that they have been complaining of a foul smell in the building for two years. They claim that they started reporting the stench in October  to their housing association and that her letterbox has been overflowing with unopened post. But it wasnapost until earlier this week that officers finally forced open the door and discovered decaying remains.  Officers say they are not treating her death as suspicious. A young woman who lives next door said: Itaposs disgusting and Iaposm just shocked. I have been living here since . Itaposs a small three story complex. I didnapost know her very well, but she would sometime collect my deliveries for me. I came back from a trip abroad in September or October  when I noticed a horric stench in the building. It was so bad, I had to put a towel under the door.  Concern for the womanaposs welfare increased among fellow residents when a forced entry notice for a routine gas check appeared on her door in . The neighbour said: We repeatedly called the housing association because it was weird - her letter box full and I could see from the letters she hadnapost been paying rent. I called them up again and said I hadnapost seen this lady in months. The police came but they said lots of people had moved out of London during the pandemic and she could be abroad. Residents again raised complaints when an abandoned bike was left outside the flat and still hadnapost been moved weeks later. But it wasnapost until police finally prized open the flat door earlier this week when they received another complaint about the bad smell.Officers broke down the door on St Maryaposs Road, Peckham, and discovered the body shortly after pm on Friday night. They broke down the door and it revealed what I had feared the whole time - that she was dead. They told me she was basically a skeleton and asked me to confirm her ethnicity, the neighbour added. A police spokesperson said: Concerns had been raised about the welfare of a woman who lived at the address. Officers attended and forced entry. The body of a -year-old woman who was deceased was found inside. The womanaposs death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. A file will be prepared for the coroner.

A venomous Huntsman spider was found in Hull after surviving in a cargo shop for around a month during its trip. The spider, which can grow up to  inches in leg span, was shipped thousands of miles from China accidentally. It gave staff quite the scare when they unpacked it, and not unwisely, they decided to leg it.Whilst the arachnid’s bite is not deadly to humans, it can still cause heart palpitations, vomiting and headaches.On Friday, the RSPCA captured the spider safely. A spokesman for the animal welfare charity said: Insp Boyd collected this Huntsman spider.  He fancied a holiday so he hopped on a shipping container in China and ended up in Hull. He gave staff quite a fright. Heaposs now having some RR at a specialist rescue centre Worryingly for arachnophobes, this is far from the first time the terrying spider has made its way to the UK. Two years ago, as the country was emerging from its first lockdown, a warehouse in Southwold, Suffolk underwent a similar discovery. A container was discovered to contain the exotic arachnid, and staff quickly called the RSPCA in again.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  At the time, RSPCA inspector Jason Finch said: “Huntsman spiders can grow up to cmin leg span so are a large iety. “This spider was on the smaller side and was only around cmfrom leg to leg. “Heaposd obviously been in the container for some time, without access to food and water, but he was still active and seemed to be OK.” He went onto say that finding exotic spiders, insects or repitiles in shipping or removal containers actually “happens quite often”. He added: “These creatures are often picked up by mistake and end up being shut inside containers or boxes. “Huntsman spiders are venomous but are not dangerous to people although they can give a nasty bite so we would always advise caution around them.“We always advise treating any unidentied animal with caution until identied accurately and not to try to handle an accidentally imported animal that has been discovered.” Instead of building webs, huntsman spiders earn their names by tracking down and killing their prey. They originate from parts of Australia, Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean Basin and the Americas. The giant spider grows to around six inches in leg span on average and several huntsman species use a bizarre cartwheel like motion to travel around, by rolling on its legs. Because they are not UK natives, releasing these spiders into the wild, or allowing them to escape, would be an offence under the Wildle and Countryside Act .

Vanessa von Schwarz, , started using e-cigarettes when she saw her friends were all doing them in the school toilets. It wasnapost long before she was taking regulars tokes off her vape, and would feel nauseous and angryshe left it for too long. Vanessa, from Los Angeles, Calornia, US, said: For some reason when I started vaping, naivety assured me my whole le was changing. I felt like it gave me something I didnapost have before I was thinner, more confident, and I was sure this new me was all thanks to this little metal device I carried in my pocket.  I struggled with a lot of anxiety, and I would consistently look at the vape thinking it was the only thing there for me at all times. That was comforting for me and made letting go even harder. She started experiencing muscle weakness in her legs and arms, but it wasnapost until she cracked her head open after falling over that doctors told her it could be linked to her vape. Now she has ditched the habit for good, but still feels the lasting effects of dermatomyositis, and wants to warn others with her cautionary tale. She said: My case is an example of how detrimental these aposminorapos and legal substances can be on oneaposs body. I hope there could be more awareness and action taken against teens vaping, especially in schools.Despite the intention, the effects on the body can be severe and my case is not the first or the last of this kind. Vanessa remembers vaping for the very first time in the toilets of her high school in April , when she was . She said: I started to realize every lunch break whenever I would enter the bathroom, there would always be groups of girls standing in a circle smoking a weird-looking thin black stick that would light up. All the aposcoolapos girls and guys in my school vaped, it was normal. Suddenly, one of my close friends bought one and after a while of her insisting I try it, claiming it did absolutely aposnothingapos - it did. Vanessa soon got into a routine of vaping anytime she was with her friends, before one Friday evening she went home and started to crave a hit.  She said: I couldnapost stop thinking about the device and how satisfied I could beI just had my own. Well itaposs not cigarettes, so I canapost smell like anything, my parents wonapost ever know because itaposs so small and secretive, and Iaposll just throw it away before I get addicted. Teenage Vanessa went on to by her own, and it got to the point where she needed her device to be around her at all times, or  she would feel nauseous and cranky. The actress said: I enjoyed the physical head rush vaping would give me. Every time I took a hit of my vape, I felt like I was inhaling a big deep breath, one that actually satisfied my body and relaxed me. I started to truly believe that vaping had changed my le for the better. The teen felt comfort in having the device readily available. I definitely think the aposchild friendlyapos flavours made the initial use of the vape so enticing, she continued. It tasted like candy and was truly delicious. After a while though, the fruity flavours became really nauseating and mint became the default since the flavour seemed to suppress hunger the most. My friends and I would never eat breakfast or lunch. We mostly just vaped away our hunger and cravings. But in May  Vanessa started feeling the side effects. I got out of bed that morning and instantly took a hit, she continued. After that, I woke up on the floor and I hadnapost remembered whataposd happened.  Iaposd clearly fainted, and I was fine, but it was so odd because that had never happened to me in my le. From then on, whenever she used her vape, she would feel weak in the knees, her fingers and toes would go numb and her heartbeat sped up. In  she developed migraines and consistent nausea after just a few hours without a hit. Her weakness got worse, but she managed to live with it until she took up a stylist job and had to be on her feet for up to nine hours a day. The New York Film Academy filmmaking student said: On top of the consistent migraines and nausea, I suddenly was unable to bend my legs fully without being in an immense amount of pain. I would come home from work in absolute agony, crying because of how badly my legs ached. My upper body became weaker and weaker, and as my legs grew weak and sore, so did my arms and fingers. It began to hurt just putting my hair in a ponytail, or even holding a water bottle was too heavy for my hands. I couldnapost lt my neck up when I was laying down, and when Iaposd fall because my legs would give out due to weakness, Ii couldnapost get up from the ground. On November  , while getting ready for work, Vanessaaposs heart started to beat very quickly and she felt lightheaded. After managing to get out the door to go, she realised she forgot something but tripped while running back up the porch steps and hit her head. She was rushed to the hospital by mum Juana, , and doctors quizzed her about her recent weakness and falls.Medics originally concluded that she must have come into contact with a toxic substance and that she needed hydrating to remove it from her body, but she had failed to mention about her vaping habit. It wasnapost until they noticed her creatine kinase levels in her blood were increasing, despite being on constant IV hydration, that she admitted sheaposd been continuing to vape in hospital in secret. She said: I had to have a serious conversation with myself about whether or not I was ready to let this addiction go, and I thought bringing up vaping to the doctors would get rid of any paranoia I had about my vape. Once they knew how excessive the use was they immediately advised me to stop, stating there was not enough research to know how vaping can affect the body.  In mid-December she was discharged from hospital, but didnapost stop vaping until a year later, convinced by some studies she found online that said it had nothing to do with her condition. That was enough for me to continue my use, despite the painful symptoms I continued to feel, said Vanessa. In , I was vaping just as heavily as I had been before, but suddenly, the symptoms started to become extremely overbearing to the point where I would have constant panic attacks. I would be in public hitting my vape, and all of a sudden my heart would start pounding in my chest, I would feel extremely lightheaded, I started trembling as my muscles tightened, and I felt nauseous all at once. My bones felt cold and shaky, I felt like I was going to drop dead on the floor. She knew she had to make a change, and she went to her doctor for help, who prescribed her with nicotine patches to ease the cravings. After about a month away from her vape her symptoms eased up, and found she had more energy and her muscles were not aching so much. She said: I donapost need to constantly worry about losing my vape or what Iaposll doI canapost vape for more than an hour. I donapost run to the bathroom every  minutes to hit my vape either, I no longer feel as controlled by something that controlled me for so long. To this day, Vanessa still suffers with dermatomyositis which causes extreme muscle pain and weakness, and believes that the condition was caused by her early addiction to vaping. She hopes that by sharing her experience she can warn other young people about the potential dangers of what is often thought to be a safer alternative to smoking. Vanessa said: Anyone who may be struggling with any sort of addiction, please know there is help. Itaposs a common misconception to believe nicotine is a small, minor addiction, and while that can be true for a lot of people, there are still those remaining that depend on the substance for their happiness, when it is incredibly short lived. I hope you will not let any addiction take over your bodyaposs health, because the effects are irreversible. Vanessaaposs father, Dr. Ernst von Schwarz, , is a clinician researcher and has written a report on his daughteraposs case. He believes her serious side effects are most likely attributed to her vaping. He said: Initiallywas introduced as a way to quit smoking, but now the role has changed immensely because it has become somewhat fashionable and does attract a lot of young people. There is very little published on the potential induction of vaping and its toxic effects on the connective tissue. Dermatomyositis is basically an inflammation of the skin and the muscle tissues, and usually we see that in elderly people, people with chronic systemic conditions, end-stage cancer patients or in patients with a family history. Sometimes itaposs as a result of side effects of certain drugs however Vanessa was not on any medications, and she didnapost have any family history which could lead to this kind of connective tissue disease. It is with a high probability that vaping in her particular case caused systemic dermatomyositis and inflammatory response. It does demonstrate how dangerous, especially for healthy young people, something like vaping can be. While the jury is still out on what the long-term impact of vaping will be on populations at large, most clinicians believe them to be less harmful than cigarettes.Dr Michael Blaha wrote for John Hopkins that there’s almost no doubt that vaping exposes you to fewer toxic chemicals than smoking traditional cigarettes.”Number crunches in the US have found that there have been , confirmed cases of e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury in the country and  deaths attributed to that condition.

The young man had no allergies and had all his childhood vaccinations according to doctorsapos records. He rarely drank alcohol, the Journal said, smoked two packs of cigarettes a week and marijuana every day.

Five hours before this admission, purplish discolouration of the skin developed and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. It was confirmed he was suffering from an aggressive bacterial infection that made his kidneys fail and his blood began to clot.  The bacteria in his blood results came back positive for Neisseria meningitidis which is a form of sepsis which can kill sufferers. Itaposs believed he became infected by the bacteria through his saliva and he had missed a booster jab for the meningococcal vaccine which he was meant to get at the age of .

But as her list of potential suitors piled up, she started to realise her success was slowing down - and sometimes she’d go days without any matches at all. “It’s like the apps were making me completely invisible,” she described. Daisy added she also stopped receiving messages from people she’d already matched with - and some of her matches were disappearing altogether. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “I was paying for the premium versions of the apps but I wasn’t getting any benefit,” she said. Daisy was also paying for “boosts” to her profile, which put a person on the top of the pile for the area they’re in. Despite her profile being more visible, Daisy realised something was up when no one appeared to be swiping right on her. She thinks the unusual activity was the result of a so-called “shadow ban” which means the account is still active, but it’s not visible to anyone  on the app. However, things only got worse for Daisy when her dating app accounts started to disappear altogether - without any warning or explanation.  “I started making more accounts using dferent phone numbers and SIM cards, but the same thing was happening every time,” she recalled. Frustrated, Daisy began emailing the dating apps she was using to find out why she was being banned from the s - but she says she’s never received a proper explanation. It’s led her to believe she’s been discriminated against for being “pretty” and having an OnlyFans account.Although she says she’s never advertised her channel on dating apps, she links back to her Instagram account, @baby.renegade, which features a link to her OnlyFans page.“I’ve had a lot of people messaging me on apps saying I’m only there to advertise my account, but I’m just being upfront about it from the beginning,” she explained. “A lot of people won’t like it andI’m looking to date, the best thing to do is be honest.” Although she can never know for sure why she’s been banned from several dating apps, Daisy suspects the OnlyFans page is the reason. She said: “I think it’s possibly to do with them not liking sex workers in general. These apps are stigmatising something that really shouldn’t be an issue. “We live in a society that encourages women to be open and free, but as soon as we talk about sex or being liberal with our bodies, we’re punished. “I think it’s misogynistic as hell.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AppsDating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her ex-husband wants nothing to do with the kids since she had cheated on him for years with many men and they arenapost his, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum. However, the woman has decided she wonapost take on her sisteraposs kids as she and her husband agreed not to have children when they got married. It would be unfair to ask my husband to make this kind of sacrice. We both agreed to no kids when we got married - to change something like that generally means a orce, she explained. Not only that, she and her husband are atheist, while her sister wants her children to be raised in church, which obviously wouldnapost fit in with their lestyle.

She cried and called me awful but itaposs my le, and ultimately I get to be selfish with it. A child isnapost an  year commitment it’s lelong, and one I have decided not to take. She cheated with multiple dferent men and lost her husband - I don’t think it’s my job to swoop in and save her from consequences of her own actions. I don’t feel like I owe her anything. Despite her pretty clear reasoning, the woman has had a number of people reaching out and telling her sheaposs making the wrong decision and needs to step up as a sister. I just feel like sheaposs trying to use me as her ticket out to dying and not feeling guilty, she wrote, before asking other Reddit users whether she was in the wrong for declining her sisteraposs requests. You arenapost obligated to take on parenting children for any reason - the rest of the vitriol in this post was pretty unnecessary. That said, regardless of how you feel about your sister, she is a dying mother who is trying to deal with all that that entails and also making sure her children will be cared for, one Reddit user comment. I don’t think that has anything to do with guilt and everything to do with doing what any mother would do in this situation. Another added: If you don’t know these children at all, I don’t see why your sister would want you to be their . How could they possibly be comfortable with you after the loss of their mother  These so-called friends of hers would be better suitedthey have an established relationship with the children.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

This has resulted in what could be the most precise current estimate of where the aircraft now lies. Unusual patterns were found in the planeaposs route including  degree turns above the ocean. Mr Godfrey suggests this supports a theory that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately took the aircraft off course. Speaking to  Minutes on Sunday, he said: Everyone has assumed up until now there was a straight path, perhaps even on autopilot. I believe there was an active pilot for the whole flight.  The plane entered an unusual holding pattern three hours into the flight which lasted for around  minutes, Mr Godfrey claims. This manoeuvre is used by pilots to delay an aircraft already in flight while keeping it within a specied airspace and is typically used to await further clearance such as before landing. Mr Godfrey explained that the temporary delay could signal that the pilot had stopped to make contact with Malaysian authorities even though government contact ceased  minutes after it departed.  Itaposs strange to me,youaposre trying to lose an aircraft in the most remote part of the Southern Indian Ocean, that you [would] enter a holding pattern, he continued. He may have been communicating with the Malaysian government, he may have been checking whether he was being followed. He may have just simply wanted time to make up his mind, where he would go from here. The expert expressed hope that the Malaysian authorities would be willing to ulge such informationthere was any such contact made eight years ago. But while the authorities have thanked him for passing on his research, he claims they told him they were very busy.  He said: If it turns out the pilot was in anyway responsible, they might be faced with multimillion claims. So maybe they just hope this will go away. Mr Godfrey flagged  specic areas over the Indian Ocean where signals were disturbed, according to his research. The findings show that there was only other aircraft in the zone that night which was at least one hour away, meaning the disturbances likely came from MH. Mr Godfrey believes that the plane was missed in previous searches.  The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said they consider his work to be credible and would renew the data. But they did not say whether they would relaunch search efforts for the wreckage. Meanwhile some experts have cast doubt over the reliability of the WSPR data which suggests that the aircraft is located in an underwater mountainous area of the Southern Indian Ocean.

Moscow’s troops amassed on Ukraine’s eastern flank now number over , – with tens of thousands more teamed up with Belarusian troops to the north.Warning about the apparent intention to invade, Boris Johnson said: “The plan we’re seeing is for something that could be the biggest war in Europe since .“All the signs are the plan has already in some senses begun.” Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said: “Everything we see indicates invasion is very, very, highly likely and very, very imminent.” Russia now has nearly % of its conventional forces threatening Ukraine, according to US intelligence analysis. Belarus suddenly announced yesterday that Vladimir Putin’s troops would remain in the country for exercises which are meant to have finished. Around  Russian warships are gathered in the Black Sea, threatening Ukraine’s southern coastline. Throughout the weekend pro-Russian separatists pounded civilian areas in the contested Donbas region with shells and mortar fire.It is feared Russia wants to provoke a major battle and use it as a ruse for invading the area under the pretence of protecting Kremlin-backed rebels. The military equipment daubed “Z” – which has increased fears of even more fighting along the front line of trenches – was between six and  miles from the border. In one case, some -plus military vehicles were seen around Bershakovo, Maksimovka, and Shebekino in the Belgorod region. The convoy included amphibious infantry fighting vehicles, mine clearing vehicles, howitzers and rocket launchers. Sometimes the “Z” – seemingly in Western lettering – is in a box.  Last year the Mirror revealed Russian troops had daubed tanks with “invasion stripes” – a white line intended to show them as friendly to other Moscow forces. In a new suspected stunt, the pro-Moscow rebel authority in Donetsk claimed to have seized a Ukrainian spy who was said to be confessing that Kyiv aims to overrun the Donbas. It is believed this is an attempt by Moscow to hit back at Western claims Russia wants to create a  flag pre-text attack for war. This would be by self-inflicting an attack and then reacting to it asit was by Ukrainian forces. Named Anton Matsanyuk, the so-called spy conveniently confirmed a plan touted in recent days by Russia of a Ukrainian plan to invade Donetsk and Luhansk. This detailed offensive plan, which fell into the hands of Donetsk intelligence officers, was broadcast by Russian TV.  Russia has extended military drills near Ukraine’s northern borders. Russian exercises, originally set to end on Sunday, brought a sizable contingent of forces to Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north. The presence of the Russian troops raised concern that they could be used to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The announcement came from the defence minister of Belarus, who said the two countries would “continue testing the response forces”. Russia held nuclear drills on Saturday as well as the conventional exercises in Belarus, and has ongoing naval drills off the coast in the Black Sea. The US and many European countries have said for months that Russia is trying to create pretexts to invade. According to the latest US intelligence assessment, Russia now has close to % of its conventional forces threatening Ukraine.  The concentration of forces within striking distance of Ukraine is highly unusual and part of the reason the US believes Russia is ready to attack, an official has said. A RUSSIAN invasion of Ukraine could unleash Europe’s biggest conflict since the Second World War - and the opening phase may already have started, Boris Johnson warned yesterday. The Prime Minister feared Vladmir Putin might have already triggered his game plan for an attack. MPs are expected to debate the crisis today when Parliament s from the February half-term recess.“The plan that we’re seeing is for something that could be the biggest war in Europe since  just in terms of sheer scale,” the PM told the BBC yesterday.“All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun - that’s what our American friends think.” Western intelligence agencies have pointed to potential “ flag” attacks the Kremlin could stage and exploit as an excuse for going to war.  Over the weekend, blasts were heard in the disputed Donbas area of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian government forces for the past eight years in clashes that have left about , people dead. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for an immediate ceasefire in the region. Mr Johnson said: “You’re seeing these provocations now in the Donbas, you’re starting to see these explosions and so on that we have been warning about for some time.” The PM will be back in Parliament today after a week of shuttle diplomacy across Europe aimed at averting war. But the efforts have so far failed to curb Russian aggression - and Mr Johnson was forced to admit the threat of sanctions against iniduals linked to Putin’s regime may fail to thwart an invasion. What do you think  Have your say in our comments below  He admitted a joint venture by Britain and the US to prevent Russian state-linked firms from trading in pounds and dollars - a move he predicted would hit the Kremlin “very hard” - may “not be enough on its own”. Moscow has called for NATO forces to leave former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries in eastern Europe. But western nations are deploying extra troops to the region to counter Russian threats. The PM warned Mr Putin: “If he thinks he’s going to get less NATO as a result of this, he’s totally wrong. He’s going to get more NATO.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

But Mr Johnson added: “We have to accept at the moment that Vladimir Putin is possibly thinking illogically about this and doesn’t see the disaster ahead.” The U.S. embassy in Russia warned Americans last night to prepare evacuation plans. The grim warning cited the threat of attacks in Moscow and along the Russian border with Ukraine, drawing condemnation from Russian foreign ministry. “There have been threats of attacks against shopping centres, railway and metro stations, and other public gathering places in major urban areas, including Moscow and St. Petersburg as well as in areas of heightened tension along the Russian border with Ukraine,” the embassy said. “Review your personal security plans,” the embassy said. “Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ukraine crisisUkraine protestsVladimir PutinRussiaCold War\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A train loaded with Terminator tank support fighting vehicles is seen in a video evidently for the first time heading towards the border. The Terminator is seen as especially suited to urban warfare. The ominous manoeuvres have been taken part in the Belgorod region of Russia only days after Moscow was originally supposed to withdraw troops, before reneging on that promise. Russian forces are now closer than ever to the frontier in preparation for an invasion which officials in the west have repeatedly warned is coming. One of the videos shows a convoy on the move near Shebekino, close to the border.The short-range all-weather Tor air defence system was visible. A Russian mobile military hospital is also seen in Shebekino town, perhaps three miles from the frontier. The presence of such medical facilities and associated blood banks is seen in the West as evidence that Putin is serious about an invasion. In another video, tanks are visible in snow at Kamenka in Kursk region, less than four miles from the Ukrainian border. Other footage shows army moves underway, for example MSTA-S howitzers around  miles from the frontier.  Multiple videos posted on TikTok and other social media from Belgorod and Kursk regions show Russian firepower in positions within easy reach of Ukraine, supporting US and UK warnings that an invasion could be imminent. As well as that, Russia staged major naval war games in the eastern Mediterranean as Moscow closed much of the Azov Sea, close to Ukraine, for drills. The Mediterranean drills involve warships from Putin’s Pacic, Northern and Black Sea fleets. Putin’s decision to reverse his previously declared intention and keep his forces in autocratic Belarus further highlights the threat of invasion to Ukraine.

But one Western source said: “Whether or not Putin invades Ukraine, it looks like he has cemented his control of Belarus without anyone noticing.”. State TV channel Rossiya  anchorman Dmitry Kiselyov - described as Vladimir Putin’s “mouthpiece” or “propagandist-in-chief” - launched a scathing attack on the Queen and Johnson needed a war to deflect attention from scandals engulfing the royal family and Downing Street. It was the Americans and English that need war”, he said, alleging Britain was especially “thirsting” for a conflict due to problems engulfing the royal family and the lockdown parties held in Downing Street. Russia, in contrast, was forcing the West into dialogue and peace”, he claimed. “ Boris Johnson ’s office keenly awaits this war because it switches attention from his government’s crisis to the pre-programmed ‘Russian invasion’,” Kiselyov told viewers.“The Royal Family is in urgent need of distractions, too, as Scotland Yard digs into Prince Charles giving away high British awards - honourable titles and even citizenship to foreign businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz. “Yet they very much want to distract attention - eventhis distraction is war. “The Queen’s favourite son Prince Andrew has settled with the victim of his rape at Mummy’s expense -  million - in a US court. “The -year-old Queen will pay.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir PutinRoyal FamilyPoliticsUkraine crisisRussia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left.

Preparatory work starts from February  to drop kerbs and improve access.Business access will remain open, with some delays as work takes place outside doorways.

In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience.

Me and Jimmyran the show. \"Derek Adams was manager at the time and he had us so well drilled. Our game plan worked a treat.\"It was Neil Lennon’s first game in charge. Georgios Samaras and Aiden McGeady kept switching wings so we knew they were struggling. Robbie Keane was up front. I’ve watched the game two or three times right through.\"It was a bit of a stalemate then we scored after about - minutes then we kind of huffed and puffed a wee bit, but they never really asked any questions. Mickdidn’t really have to make any saves..remove“The break away in the th minute. We go down the right and Barradid brilliant to find Jimmy. It’s just great memories. You always want people to recognise the performance rather than just the result sometimes and our performance that day merited the win.“To score in the last five minutes and to beat the champions at the time - was a fantastic day. It was one of those days where everything clicked for us. My dadwas at the game and had a connection with Celtic and I just remember after the game looking up at the stand and I saw him and he was just standing with his hands in the air.”Scott added: “Stevie’s goal was unbelievable.

It was wrong and it should never have happened, and I am sorry that it did.“Last May, Scottish Borders Council agreed to commission an independent inquiry to look at how the council dealt with issues connected to the conviction of a former teacher for assault.

Although the report addresses the response of the council as a whole, I will be considering the detail and paying particular attention to the recommendations as they apply to education.“For my part, I too am deeply saddened by contents of the report. It makes for very uncomfortable reading.“I am clearly sorry that the matters were not referred to the Child Protection Unit early on, and I am sorry that communication with the parents was so clearly wrong. It should never have happened and we should have done much better.“I will be working closely with my fellow Elected Members to fully consider the Independent Inquiry report, and to look at how we ensure the abuse experienced by these young people does not happen again.

happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in

was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points

In doing so, we are offering no mere conventional respect to a great public figure who has passed from us.#We did not think of George VI as a monarch living in high places, remote from the lives of the ordinary men and women of this realm.#Such was his le and character that his passing came as personal grief to everyone of his loyal subjects. We think today of a man who served us all with the highest and most self-sacricing sense of duty and probably beyond the limits of his strength – a man of complete integrity and of great personal courage and endurance.#His le exemplied the virtues on which, as we all know, the welfare of our nation depends. What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul

only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin internment, but below the average for a cremation.

This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty Partnership set up by East Lothian Council is due to hold its first meeting next month, bringing together public sector agencies, voluntary organisations and community groups to combine efforts to tackle poverty.”"},{"url":null,"title":"council-continuing-monitor-river-esk-wake-pollution-incident","story":"The Scottish Environment Protection Agencyhas been carrying out “a range of investigations and assessments” in relation to the source of the oil-based spillage, which was first reported at the river on January .: Investigation continues into source of River Esk pollutionAn East Lothian Council spokesperson told the Courier: “We continue to monitor the controls and measures, such as booms which are in place to contain and mitigate any remaining pollution following last month’s incident in the Esk.“It remains our expectation that these will remain in place while SEPA’s investigation is ongoing.“We will continue to provide our support, including through multi-agency meetings to review progress and actions.”SEPA said that it would have no further update on the river this week."},{"url":null,"title":"funding-offered-parents-want-defer-childs-entry-primary-one","story":"The new plan will mean that parents and carers with children who turn five between August , , and the end of February  will be entitled to defer entry until the following year.

according to publishers, saw him “revelling in the liberating glories of surf, sand and their sensualities”.He said: “The funny thing is I have spent my le flying and people always ask me to write a book about flying and dferent places in my le.“There is a better story when I was leguarding.“It is more human and ied in some ways so I thought I would write about that, which I did.“Sometimes anecdotes come up when you have got a pint in your hand and somebody mentions something and it reminds you of something.“Often in the book, I draw on these anecdotes that I remember.“When you are younger, things stick in your memory for all your le.”Kenny grew up in Fairlie, in Ayrshire, before swapping Scotland’s west coast for the south-west of England.Water has played a key role in Kenny’s le, from surfing in Cornwall to becoming part of Dunbar Coastal Rowing Club.A director of Dunbar Harbour Trust, he penned All Summer Long during lockdown and described it as “a wonderful coming of age”.Whilst at university, he escaped westwards every summer to be a professional leguard on Sennen Beach in Whitesands Bay, West Cornwall.After graduating, he spent six months as a teacher in Barbados, and three more months hitchhiking through the USA, Canada and Alaska, then overland through Central America to ‘hidden’ Popayan in the Andes of Colombia.He would go on to learn to fly with British Airways and was later a flying instructor, working almost everywhere in the world, including China, Russia, France and India.He said: “When I was about , I said to my mother: ‘We always seem to live in beautul places.’“We have moved around several times and she said: ‘Any fool can live in a horrible place.’“Her attitude was ‘don’t try to get yourself the most wonderful house you can afford but the most beautul area you can afford, even in the most humble dwelling’.”All Summer Long is released at the end of the month, with the author pleased to say he had some positive reviews from family members.The Dunbar resident said: “I’m suffering from imposter syndrome at the moment where I think it is not me and should not be me but the people who have read it say don’t feel bad

Nevertheless, the process also put data-driven decision-making front and centre of the public consciousness.Brian Hills, interim chief executive of The Data Lab, believes this is an important and often overlooked factor in the digital transformation taking place across the economy.“Every day we have been talking about data with governments giving out the latest statistics around Covid, so everybody starts to become familiar with ‘here’s the data, here’s the decisions being made’, and people have become accustomed to the use of data in helping organisations make decisions,” he explains. “It is a step-change that is going to continue.”Set up in  as part of Scotland’s network of innovation centres, The Data Lab is charged with driving growth of articial intelligenceand data science skills across the academic and business community.Mr Hills assumed the top role on an interim basis at the beginning of this year, and has his hat in the ring for the permanent appointment. He originally joined The Data Lab as head of product and data before advancing to deputy chief executive in June .: Ethics and values should be at forefront of decision-makingBorn in Glasgow and raised in the Highlands, Mr Hills began his career at what was then known as HP in South Queensferry in  after completing his master’s degree in computing at the University of Aberdeen. He later worked for nearly eight years at Sumerian, the Glasgow-based networked applications group founded by David Sibbald, and then joined travel search website Skyscanner in  where he created the Edinburgh-based firm’s business intelligence unit.From an initial team of , The Data Lab has grown to  people working across bases in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness. Its mission is to help Scotland “maximise value from data and lead the world to a data-powered future”.“For us fundamentally it’s about changing lives,” Mr Hills said.“How do we create the skills that enable people to have the careers they want to have in this area  How do we use data and collaboration across academia, industry and public sectors to innovate new products across ranges of dferent sectors ”Backed by government money provided through the Scottish Funding Council and Scottish Enterprise, The Data Lab also periodically receives one-off funding directly from the Scottish Government for specic projects. Examples include TORCH, which launched in  as a “matchmaking” service to help businesses with limited technical experience make better use of their data.: Data harvesting will reap climate rewardsOne of last year’s TORCH clients, Mercat Tours, decided to use the suspension of its Edinburgh walking tours during lockdown to consolidate its operations into a single IT system. The company also upskilled eight of its team members through the Data Skills for Work programme.“They saw that as a key competency that they need in their business going forward,” Mr Hills said. “Now they are a lot more operationally efficient and can scale up what they do as more visitors come back to Edinburgh.”As the acceleration of the digital transformation driven by the pandemic has pushed demand for data skills to unprecedented highs, the challenge for “’everybody in the ecosystem” is to not only train up the next generation but also unlock talent among existing workers.The Data Lab advises there are three key components to attracting new data employees: articulate a clear set of company values provide a straightforward explanation of the problems to be solved and outline the opportunities for professional growth and career advancement.“We also talk about the fourth alternative of upskilling people that are already in your company,” Mr Hills said. “It is quite expensive in time and money to go through a hiring process in a very competitive market, so can you take advantage of the ious upskilling schemes that are available to invest in your existing team ”There has been an increase in the number of firms taking up this fourth option, he said, but much more could still be done in this area. There has also been an uptick in the number of more mature workers retraining for data jobs in sectors such as healthcare because they believe it will have a materially positive effect on society.“We are seeing a trend that people want to pivot in their careers,” Mr Hills said. “I think people are taking a step back to see what they really want to do with their lives.“We are certainly seeing that in a lot of people who are mature in their careers – whatever you phrase mature as – who are really interested in making a change and doing something that they feel passionately about.”What countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why It has to be Canada – my we is Canadian so I have to be specic and say Nova Scotia.

Her determination to crush the trade unions, especially the miners’ union, was another example of her extreme stubbornness.He tells us that the more women are involved in leading a society, the less militarily aggressive the society is. Mrs Thatcher said that “there is no such thing as society”. Mrs Thatcher ordered the sinking of the Belgrano, with massive loss of le, an act of military aggression for which she never displayed any remorse. She may not have been typical among female world leaders but the attitudes, opinions and actions of female British home secretaries in recent years have not displayed much sign of compassion.Following in Mrs Thatcher’s footsteps we’ve seen pictures of Ruth Davidson posing on a tank and now it’s over to Liz Truss to keep up the tradition. The image of a politician, whether man or woman, posing with a tank does not suggest “less militarily aggressive” to me.David Clark, Tarbolton.FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AT RISKROSEMARY Goring’s article about the debate over slaverywas a helpful contribution to discussion of an issue that is threatening one of the fundamental values of our culture, freedom of expression.There are a number of issues where levels of vitriol and aggression are successfully closing down the ability to freely discuss issues, not by state censorship but by a kind of self-righteous and intolerant certainty that is redolent of the approach taken in the past by religious orthodoxy in its attacks upon blasphemy and heresy.Two other examples in addition to that mentioned by Ms Goring are the use of allegations of transphobia associated with discussion of transgender issues and the use of anti-Semitism allegations in connection with discussion of the politics of the state of Israel. In both these cases, people, including academics, offering articulate and well-reasoned positions that do not make any offensive comment or propose discriminatory or unjust treatment in relation to trans or Jewish people are successfully persecuted, losing jobs and suffering intolerable harassment.The case of Katherine Stock, who lost her position as a professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex for publishing a closely argued and thoughtful text that disagreed with the required orthodoxy on the trans issue is a scandalous example of the former.And the case of the Jewish members of the Labour Party who have been expelled for anti-Semitism or otherwise facing anti-Semitism chargesfor their comments on the policies of the state of Israel, is a preposterous example of the latter.The lobbies in both these caseshave realised that terrorising opposing points of view is a very effective form of censorship since most people will not wish to risk straying into such areas given the potential consequences.One of the cardinal values defining our culture, the freedom to express opinions in tolerant debate and discussion, is very sadly being lost.Stephen Smith, Glasgow.GET OUT OF MALLS, ON TO THE STREETSI CONFESS to a hearty dislike of aimless shopping generally and doing it in a mall in particular, so was interested in discussion on the future of Glasgow’s “Style Mile” . By all means repurpose the malls to something.Most of my pleasure in being in the city centre is doing necessary shopping in the relatively fresh air of the street with the endless entertainment afforded by the theatre of my fellow punters going about their business. The only blight is the rain, so why not examine the cost of canopies for the pedestrian areas of the three streets, with incentives for retailers to move out of the malls into the many vacant shops The Victorians who built the city centre also built many fine examples to copy. Then we would have the boons of fresh air, shelter from the wet, street entertainment, decent shops and a low virus-risk environment for a cost that must be less than construction costs of large unpleasant buildings.John Murdoch, Innellan.MY DISMAY OVER BURRELL CHANGESI NOTE Clare Henry’s article about the re-opening of the Burrell . I am sorry to read they have taken away the original doorway at the entrance. It is ridiculous to suggest it was off-putting.I do not like what I have seen of the huge stairway. It was sad to read they have removed a lot of the archways, which in my opinion made the Burrell such a brilliant place to visit. It was alway such a pleasure to go through an archway to discover some new surprise.Catherine Bergamini, Glasgow.LADIES LEGS AND SEAMLESS THOUGHTSSEEING those quite well-drawn seams on the legs of the lady in the photo in your Remember when... section , rekindled a memory of some of the badly self-drawn lines that ran up my teenage legs. Once when going to a social at the Methodist Youth Club,and only having one pair of Aristoc nylons left to wear, and those being seamless, I asked our next-door neighbourshe would draw seams up my legs with her eyebrow pencil, or whatever she used herself.Then there was school with which to cope ... the long-stockings we were allowed to wear in the sixth form were putty-coloured thick lisle ones definitely passion-killers but they were a distinct improvement on the three-quarter- grey socks which we hauled up to just above our knees, and held there with circulation-blocking elastic bands. It was good to leave all that teenage nonsense behind.Unbelievably,I was teenager now I would be wearing those thick, black things that look like leggings.

I would also like to assure you that the Scottish Government is pursuing every possible option to protect Scotlands position in Europe and, by extension, the interests of the people from across the European Union who live here,\" she said.Her letter was welcomed in EU circles.Last year the EUs ambassador to the UK Joao Vale de Almeida gave a message of appreciation to Ms Sturgeon for supporting European citizens in Scotland.And head of his visit Mr Trombetta last night thanked the Scottish Government for its help.“Three years after my first visit, I am delighted to finally have a chance toto Scotland. In the meantime, many things have changed: Covid and Brexit have been the big game changers in the le of all the Italians living in the UK,\" he said.\"While the pandemic seems to have eased its gauge on all of us, we are still dealing with the consequences of Brexit. This visit is an occasion to thank Scottish institutions for their support and collaboration in the registration campaign of EU citizens in the EU Settlement Scheme.\"In particular, we know we can rely on the attention of the Scottish Government in continuing to guarantee all rights, in all areas, of Italian citizens residing in Scotland and facilitate the regularization of the most vulnerable categories, the elderly, unaccompanied minors and the homeless.\"He added: \"It will be interesting to hear from the Scottish Government about the efforts and measures put in place to boost the economy and local development after the most intense peak of the Covid- pandemic. There is an interesting parallel to the latest Italian systemic reforms, powered by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.\"Italy is creating the conditions to make our south a new fertile ground for investment in five or ten years, based on an effective logistics network and a more favourable juridical and administrative environment. I deem we can share best practices on this and build together a new model for a more equal development throughout our countries. Scottish institutional funds may also look into these new investment opportunities in Italy.”His visit also comes as the First Minister prepares to hold a second independence referendum and campaign to take Scotland back into the EU as an independent country.In the meantime her government wants to extend its influence in the EU and has opened a series of headquarters in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin. A new office is to open this spring in Copenhagen.The ties are primarily focused on increasing business and trade opportunities but the Scottish Government also hope greater international engagement will lead to favourable opinion in Europe on Indyref and smooth access to joining the EU should Scotland become independent.Earlier this month Angus Robertson, the Scottish Constitution Secretary, referred to international reaction should the UK Government continue to oppose a second independence vote.\"The UK Government telling the people of Scotland what they can and cant do, that fundamentally changes the nature of the UK, will move the question on from being the challenge of independence to democracy itself,\" Robertson told BBCs Newsnight.\"And that will be viewed not just domestically but internationally as countries around the world will look at the UK and will see an entirely dferent state than they previously thought it was.\"There are currently just under , Italian citizens living in Scotland , an % increase compared to the numbers registered in  .Italians are the third largest EU community in Scotland .

My brother was a professional footballer, my young brother wasn’t quite good enough to be professional but had a fine footballing career. My father was a good amateur player but got an injury while he was young so didn’t make it to the top. He always wanted his boys to play football but more than that, he always wanted us to be successful and ambitious.“At that time footballers didn’t make any money. I was told to leave school at  – I wasn’t going to university, none of that. I went off to Beecham’s Pharmaceuticals to go and be an electrician and they turned me down – my dad was delighted with that – but they did offer me a position as an instrument articer. Don’t ask me what the second part means, I’ve no idea!“I trained for four years after leaving school and going into a factory environment. You grow up quite quick working alongside wise old men who are always looking to take the p*** out of the apprentices. It was a good learning experience.“My football career picked up a wee bit when I was picked up by St Mirren thanks to my schoolboy form. I got farmed out to play in the Ayrshire Juniors League, which toughens you up: teenage boys playing against seasoned pros. Or hardened criminals, as I called them. But I learned how to look after myself and at  won a part-time contract with St Mirren.”Clarke continued: “You pick up the experience of all these people you work with. A factory is a totally dferent environment to a dressing room but there are a lot of similar characters. There are people who are always testing you, always looking for you to make a mistake to see how you react.“You get the ones who will try and bully you and you have to stand up to them and recognise that they’re trying to bully you. You get the ones that will go out of their way to help you – I met a lot of really good people in the factory – and in Junior football you get similar lessons.“You get people who look after you because they see your talent and you try and take those values in. These people just want you to be honest and straightforward – they just want you to go in, do your work, not got ideas above your station. Andyou did get ideas above your station, they’d knock your head off. It was a good way to grow up and a good learning environment.“I like honesty in the people I work with right through from the staff to the players. I think you foster that by example and try to be as honest as you can be.”"},{"url":null,"title":"steve-clarke-details-chats-kieran-tierney-lyndon-dykes-turned-scotlands-fortunes-around","story":"The good news for foot soldiers in the Tartan Army is that Clarke has identied where his Hampden predecessors got it wrong and – for the most part, anyway – the problems have been solved.Issues like how to fit Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney into the same starting XI are now a thing of the past. Scott McTominay’s conversion into a central defender has plugged a hole at the back. Lyndon Dykes was convinced to choose to represent Scotland at international level and has quickly established himself as an important player under Clarke.These problems were tactical in nature but Clarke reckons the biggest obstacle he had to overcome was more of a human one. After decades of despondency and disappointment, shting the mentality of his players was always going to be a sizeable task but it is one that the national team manager has achieved in a relatively short space of time.“Club management is dferent from the job I’m doing now because you just borrow the players for the national team,” Clarke told the High Performance podcast. \"They’re not really your players so it’s a little bit easier.“They’re there to represent their country, they all want to be there. I think that’s one of the things we’ve brought back to the national team, a little bit of pride. When you’re in a club environment you see the players daily so you can drip-feed those values.“I think respect in football goes a long way. If you have a group of players that respect each other then you’ve got a chance.“Over a number of camps you start to drip-feed it in. It wasn’t an easy start – my first game was Cyprus at Hampden and everyone thought ‘Easy, we’ll win in that one’. We got a last-minute goal so we just made it. After that we backed it up with games against Belgium and Russia and we got absolutely scudded.“I’m looking at this group of players who had been there before – who had a long period of failure, failure, failure – and you’re thinking ‘I need to find a way to change the culture’. Getting beat - in Moscow was probably the lowest point of my reign and I started to question myself.“I told the players that was unacceptable and it was probably the only time I’ve lost my temper with the players. You don’t want to upset them or have a go at them – that can be dficult to repair and you don’t have the time that you get at a club. But I was angry.“We managed to win the next game and we had two games left, and I had to find a way of changing this losing mentality where we turn up, get beat, lose out and the manager gets sacked. I didn’t want to get sacked I wanted to hang about for a bit longer because I felt I had something to offer.”Clarke decided to change his team’s shape when the Scotland boss opted for a back three, even though it was a formation he wasn’t overly familiar with at the time. It proved to be a masterstroke as the players now look happy, settled and comfortable within a system that makes the most of their talents.Clarke admits that conversations with a few key members of the squad had to be had to get the players onside as he explained the process behind his tactical tinkering.“Between November and March I was thinking about what we were good at,” Clarke explained. “Defensively we weren’t great and needed a change. I phoned my coaches and said ‘we can’t go with a back four, I want to go with a back three’. I had never coached a back three in my le so it was a challenge for me and my coaches.“The personnel we had – we had two of the best left-backs in world football, Tierney and Robertson, and had to figure out how to get them in the team. At that moment I didn’t think the centre-back options were great, so let’s pick three and seethat makes it better!“My idea was that Tierney could play centre-back and I had this mad idea that Scott McTominay could play as one of the others. I had good midfield players and I wanted to get three or four into the team but had nothing great up front really.“I’m not trying to knock the boys we had down, they did everything they could to be successful for us, but I needed to find a striker. Fortunately I found an Australian one! I knew that Lyndon was available and I had a conversation with him where I managed to persuade him to come.“I had a really good conversation with Tierney to tell him he was going to be the best left-sided centre-back that Scotland had ever had. A myth had built up around Kieran that he didn’t want to come and play with the national team, which wasn’t correct. But I think he always felt that he was a better left-back than Andy Robertson. Every player thinks they’re better than the immediate competition andyou compare them, there isn’t a cigarette paper between them.“I had to persuade Kieran that he was better than Andy and that’s why I trusted him to play left centre-back and not Andy. Now, that’s probably not strictly true but that’s how I had to sell it to Kieran. Now we’ve got the best overlapping centre-back in world football. It works.“Selling that position to Kieran was important and it was a really good conversation, he asked a lot of really good questions. I told him I loved him and I wanted him to play there.“The conversation with Lyndon was quite straightforward. I said to him, ‘I don’t knowyou feel Scottish or Australian, only you can decide. This is what we have, this is your competition, but you have to decide who you want to play for because I can’t see inside your mind.’ He phoned me back and said, ‘I’m Scottish, my we is Scottish and I want to play for the national team’. I think everyone will agree he’s done quite well for us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"steve-clarke-reveals-senior-players-inspired-scots-momentous-win-serbia","story":"The current crop of players brought Scotland’s -year wait to reach the finals of a major tournament to a close with a penalty shoot-out win over Serbia in November  but it was anything but straightforward.Ryan Christie handed the Scots a priceless advantage before a stoppage-time equaliser from Luka Jovic forced extra-time as a familiar sinking feeling took hold of the Tartan Army.The stage was set for Clarke’s players to write the latest chapter in Scotland’s history of glorious failure but instead, they managed to hold on and seal a memorable triumph on spot-kicks.Clarke admits that Serbia’s last-gasp equaliser was hard to take but revealed that it was the players themselves who inspired each other to victory. And the Scotland head coach refutes the notion that he has been the catalyst for the wave of optimism that has swept across the national team.“I’m not sure I changed the mentality of Scottish football: it was my team,” he told the High Performance podcast. “Out on the pitch the supporters engage with the players, not me. I’m very dficult to engage with!“I don’t look for credit, it doesn’t bother me. Everyone likes to be loved, everyone wants to be appreciated butthe credit doesn’t come then it doesn’t come. I can live with that. As long as I can go to my bed and know that I’m doing the right things, that I’m good at what I do and that I have the love and support of my family – that’s enough for me.“I definitely underestimated [the shit in mentality that was required] and it was something we had to shake. We ended up shaking it in the most Scottish way that you could.“I thought we were magnicent for  minutes in the play-off with Serbia and then they get one last corner. You think, ‘Come on lads, just defend it’. But no, we concede a goal. You think, ‘here we go again, Scotland and glorious failure’ because up until we conceded, I thought the performance was as good as anything I’d seen from a Scottish team going away to a dficult opponent.“You’re on the sidelines thinking ‘surely not again’ because I don’t think we would have recovered from thatwe hadn’t qualied. I certainly couldn’t have because I know how close we were and how well we had played.“The last thing I said to them [before kick-off] was that there were  of them in the room but only one person had been to a major final with his country, and unfortunately he’s not Scottish. It was [coach] Steven Reid, who went to the World Cup with Ireland as a player. I said, ‘this is your chance to go and do it, don’t burden yourself with what’s happened before because we can’t affect what’s happened before’.“The last thing I said to them was ‘don’t play with the fear of failure, try to play with the anticipation of success’. I think we did that up until that goal. After that we clung on and I was worried for them.“That’s when you start to hear [Andy] Robertson, [John] McGinn, Kenny McLean, Ryan Jack, Callum McGregor: ‘we’re still in the competition, we can still get through’. That desire was still there so as a coach, I’m thinking that we’re all right because I didn’t have to say too much. They did it.”Clarke is in no doubt that his squad is blessed with natural leaders, with many prominent players plying their trade in the English Premier League. Mixing it with some of the world’s best players on a weekly basis, Clarke says, brings a welcome swagger to the team.“McGinn and Robertson bring personality,” he added. “The boys that play in the Premier League bring an assuredness to the squad.“Robertson has won the Champions League and the Club World Cup, [Kieran] Tierney is down there playing now, Scott McTominay isn’t shy of confidence. They bring an assuredness to the squad that everyone  buys into.“You’ve got the captain of Celtic, you’ve got a future captain at Arsenal, captain Andy playing at Liverpool, McTominay could be a captain at United, McGinn could be a captain anywhere.

But only two chairs were set out in front of the EU and Turkish flags for the three leaders, and Mr Michel took the chair next to Mr Erdogan.Asked Monday about the awkward moment with the Ugandan foreign minister, EU commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer said the incident was not addressed at all by Ms von der Leyen.Mr Mamer said Ms von der Leyen is kept busy by the worrying tensions between Ukraine and Russia.He added that the commission did not play any role in the controversy playing out in the media.“Who said that there was an incident  Did you hear the European Commission say that there was an incident  Absolutely not,” Mr Mamer said.“Please, leave the European Commission president out of this story… Frankly, I think we should avoid making a storm in a teacup.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

I was her son and I was also her friend, companion and chauffer.“We had meals out together or we would have taken trips to places like Portrush and Portballintrae.“She would say to me ‘I liked that wee place you took me to today, but it wasn’t as good as the last one’.”Hannah enjoyed seven years of good health after Robert’s passing, but Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. However, it wasn’t until she didn’t recognise her own home that he knew something was wrong.“That night sticks out a mile,” he said. “When mummy wanted to say something quietly she had this habit of giving you a nudge in the ribs. And as we approached the house she gave me a wee nudge and said ‘do these people know we are visiting ’.”After a fall at home she was taken into hospital and was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Mervyn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and carers who visited daily.It took an emotional toll on him, and he found himself getting exasperated by his mum losing or forgetting things, but after accepting she had a ‘disease of the mind’ things became easier.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died in infancy.“At the start, caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.“It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one, but you can’t really talk to them.“People have said it’s like looking after the living dead because it can feel like they’re not getting any benefit of all the things you do for them.“But when she died it was still very dficult. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honour and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Mervyn, who volunteered to help at two vaccination centres during the pandemic, decided to volunteer as a steward for this year’s Alzheimer’s Society Belfast GLOW Walk to help other people who are caring for a loved one with dementia.He will join people of all ages and walking abilities for a colourful around walk from The Titanic Quarter along the River Lagan and past many historical locations.Participants are encouraged to dress in neon, bring glow sticks and sport their brightest outfits to raise funds and awareness for the , people living with dementia in Northern Ireland.There’s never been a more important time for Belfast residents to glow the distance and come together to raise vital funds for le-changing dementia support. Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used over six million times since the start of the pandemic but too many people are still facing dementia alone.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Northern Ireland Country Director said: “We would like to thank Mervyn and all of our amazing volunteers who helping us with the GLOW event this March.“Belfast GLOW is a fabulous opportunity to make memories with family and friends, all while raising money and awareness for the , living with dementia across Northern Ireland who continue to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic.“Nobody should have to face dementia alone without adequate support. That’s why we’re urging the people of Belfast to shine a light on dementia alongside your family and friends this March and help make a dference in the fight against dementia.“Every pound raised will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.” Help create a brighter future for people affected by dementia alongside family and friends at Alzheimer’s Glow Belfast at the Titanic Quarter on  March.at alzheimers.org.uk glow "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1564499438658.jpg--agri_food_leaders_call_on_stormont_to_follow_the_science_on_climate_change_legislation.jpg?1564499438000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220221newsagri food leaders call on stormont to follow the science on climate change legislation","story":"Industry leaders within the agri-food supply chain have said thatpassed unchanged, the Executive Climate Change Bill would have devastating consequences, including job losses, for the Northern Ireland economy. The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”"},{"url":null,"title":"passionate about education and equality for all braniel primary school pays tribute to christopher stalford","story":"A primary school where Christopher Stalford served as a governor has described him as someone who was \"passionate about education and equality for all\".The board of governors and staff at Braniel Nursery and Primary School were speaking following the DUP politician#s sudden death at the age of .Mr Stalford#s four children are pupils at the school.Read More‘A decent and dedicated public servant’ – Northern Ireland’s political parties pay tribute to Christopher StalfordPrincipal Diane Dawson said she was “devastated” by the news, describing Mr Stalford as a “dear friend, school governor and the most wonderful, loving dad”.She said: I will never recall a time when he didn’t make me laugh.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum.

With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built.

At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September.

We didnrsquot want the disappointment again. We were actually down in Croke Park last Sunday for a kick-about and we did a presentation with the lads.ldquoWe happened to do it in the media room and when I walked into it I immediately got that feeling of walking in after the  final loss and having to answer all the questions about where it all went wrong.Conleth continued: ldquoI remember thinking to myself that I never want to have to do that again.For Magpies manager, Mickey Moran, it was a case of creating your own destiny.The Kilcoo boss has suffered All-Ireland heartache on three separate occasions ndash with Slaughtneil, Mayo and Kilcoo ndash and at half-time on Saturday he was on the verge of another when his side trailed by six points.ldquoMickey really gave it good. Every now and again, does give really cross speeches, said Gilligan.ldquoHe hadnrsquot done one of those at all this year he hadnrsquot even raised his voice but this was one where he basically asked the boys to stand up and be counted or get their bags and go out on to the bus now.His words hit home with the players leaving nothing on the pitch as they overcame the Dublin kingpins in a breathtaking finale graced by scintillating football.With just added time of extra time left to play, Jerome Johnston fired the winning goal home to cue scenes of pandemonium that would last well beyond the final whistle.As the players, management and travelling support arrived back up north to their native-village as All-Ireland heroes, Moran prepared a heartfelt speech alongside goalkeeper Niall Kane, who also highlighted the magnitude of their achievement.The celebrations lasted long overnight and into the weekend, with those involved with the club finally relaxing after a strenuous season in which they were forced to never stop working until it was over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Matthew puts in stirring dance in honour of his late friend%2C Ryan  ","story":"A MOVING dance tribute to his late friend who died in an accident earned Matthew MacNabb the top score of the night in Sundayrsquos Dancing With The Stars Ireland.The contemporary dance from the Downpatrick man and his partner Laura Nolan also got the top combined score of the night between judgesrsquo scores and viewersrsquo votes, which means they are immune for being sent home next weekend.The  year-old, who gained popularity from his appearance in ITVrsquos Love Island over the summer, met his friend Ryan Freeman while he was travelling in the United States.Ryan died in an accident in Phoenix, Arizona, at the age of  while Matthew was quarantining before he went on to Love Island.Matthew chose to honour his friend in the lsquodedicated dancersquo night week as each celebrity paid tribute to someone special in their lives.He told the Recorder: ldquoIt was an incredible moment.

They say residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades.Council chairwoman, Cathy Mason, was one of a number of local politicians provided with a progress report on the Newcastle project last week by senior council directors.She described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as really welcome news.She continued: ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike and I am delighted that the plans are in the final stages. The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns. The assessment will happen after the new local authority-funded play park has been built at the GAA site, he said.Cllr Brown confirmed that he is also pushing for the safety railings to be extended from the Oaks Restaurant to the GAA ground to ldquomaximise the safety of residents, in particular, families with young children who will be making frequent use of the site.He added: ldquoI share residentsrsquo concerns about road safety in Darragh Cross and believe that enacting these measures over the coming months should be a departmental priority.ldquoHowever, I hope that collectively, these steps will begin to alleviate many of the villagersquos safety concerns for the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Traders invited to get  involved in town future  ","story":"TRADERS in Downpatrick are being urged to have their say on the future development of the town with a primary focus on what can be done to revive its economic fortunes.The appeal comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that it is to organise a workshop event to gauge the business communityrsquos key priorities, particularly in a post-Covid environment.Details of the workshop event comes as the debate continues about appointing a dedicated town centre manager who would act as a link between the business community and wide range of statutory agencies and funders to help drive new initiatives and opportunities.Council officers have already spoken with a number of businesses on the issue, but it was confirmed at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee that a more co-ordinated plan now needs to be developed.Officials argue this is necessary in order to agree priorities on the way forward to manage expectations through the development of strategy focused on the needs of the town.Plans for a workshop to discuss the issue are being drawn up with appeals to everyone in business in Downpatrick to take part to provide as wide ofview of the potential way forward as possible.The workshop will focus on the main priorities to help develop a new strategy with calls for an independent person to head up the exercise which, it is hoped, will outline recommendations on the way forward.A proposal to appoint a Downpatrick town centre manager to help plan the townrsquos economic revival and long-term future was tabled last year and referred to the council committee for discussion.A number of councillors believe such an appointment is a ldquocritical component of the drive to support the business community, increase footfall and, crucially, help attract new investment to the county town.It has been suggested a town centre manager could work closely with the business community to develop fresh ideas and initiatives, but nothingwill happen before the outcome of the proposed workshop is known.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed confirmation of the workshop and are fully supportive of the development of a strategic plan being mapped out for the town.Cllr Curran believes that appointing town centre manager deserves close attention and is keen to hear what the business community and other stakeholders have already said about the way forward.ldquoI see great merit in having a dedicated town centre manager, he continued.ldquoThe proposed workshop that is to be held is crucially important and I would appeal to everyone in business to get involved and have their say. This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart.

Picture by Brian LittleI first met him at Stormont in the late s, when he was still at school, and a frequent visitor to Stormont with his friend and constituency predecessor Mark Robinson MLA.As a student he was a bit of a political geek, with a depth of knowledge and analysis of local, national and international politics that belied his youth, equally at home discussing the latest developments in Washington or Westminster, as he was with Sandy Row or Stormont . As with many of us who were involved in politics from a young age, he initially came across as a bit square and we often joked that he started off middle aged and became younger with age.He came from a close and loving family, but was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and achieved his many successes through hard work and ability. Indeed, from early meetings his intelligence, talent and potential shone through, which was why as soon as I joined the DUP in , I headhunted him to work for me, first as a student, and then after graduation, becoming his first employer.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

High Sherf, Deputy Mayor and MLA filled me with pride but given his abilities no little surprise. When he became Principal Deputy Speaker he was filled with joy, not least because he knew the pleasure it would give his much loved family.Christopher was someone who cared about his city and his community. Although he moved house several times, it was always within Belfast itself. He was passionately committed to delivering for his constituents, and was a fearsome debater, who could deliver an argument with clarity, passion and wit. He was a true Unionist and Orangeman through and through, andyou had cut him in two he would have had DUP written through him like a stick of rock.He was not however a two dimensional political ideologue. Although he never swayed in his unionist convictions, his friendships and courtesy cut across the political spectrum. Indeed one of his sparring partners from Queens, Mary Durkan who became an SDLP Councillor in Londonderry, would be sure to ask me any time I met her “How is Stalfie doing ” The breadth of tributes paid to Christopher is a measure of the respect he engendered throughout the political world and beyond.Christopher was a Bon viveur and good company, a man with a wide hinterland of interests, and hidden depths as anyone who has heard him perform Sinatra in karaoke can testy. He was also a man of quiet, untrumpeted kindness. When my mother died a few months ago, knowing that I would be alone, he insisted that I spend Christmas Day with him and his family, That was the Christopher that lay behind the public image.Above all he was a devoted family man, who glowed with love and pride for his beloved we Laura and their four children. The country has lost a great representative, I have lost a great friend, but it is the loss of a husband, father, son and brother that will be most keenly felt and cruelly missed.

Just this week, we discussed his eldest child’s school transfer and it is dficult to put into words my shock, sadness and devastation just days later we are discussing his passing.“He was a genuine and funny person, who was dedicated to public service. Christopher revelled in the role of Principal Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, carrying out his duties in an even-handed and fair manner, no matter the situation.”Mrs Long added: “My thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies are with Christopher’s we Laura, his four children, the wider family circle and his party colleagues.“His friends and colleagues throughout the world of politics will miss his political contribution, and his constituents his local efforts and leadership across South Belfast.”• North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has paid his own tribute to Christopher Stalford – a DUP colleague he described as “colourful and full of fun”.Mr Paisley said: “To Laura and his lovely wee family I express my prayers and deepest condolences and pray God will comfort them in this valley of tears.“Christopher was a young energetic and enthusiastic member of the party from before his days at Queens University where he become very actively involved in politics.“On meeting Christopher in those days It was inevitable that he would make a le in political service. He just loved politics and engagement with the public and he was an excellent barometer of where public opinion within unionism rested.”He said a “shadow of loss” hangs over the party.Mr Paisley added: “He rose very quickly through the ranks of the party achieving electoral success and ultimately making the South Belfast assembly seat his own. He was cut out for the deputy speaker role and would have no doubt climbed to higher office.“I last spoke to Chris in the middle of the past week after his appearance on the media.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But only two chairs were set out in front of the EU and Turkish flags for the three leaders, and Mr Michel took the chair next to Mr Erdogan.Asked Monday about the awkward moment with the Ugandan foreign minister, EU commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer said the incident was not addressed at all by Ms von der Leyen.Mr Mamer said Ms von der Leyen is kept busy by the worrying tensions between Ukraine and Russia.He added that the commission did not play any role in the controversy playing out in the media.“Who said that there was an incident  Did you hear the European Commission say that there was an incident  Absolutely not,” Mr Mamer said.“Please, leave the European Commission president out of this story… Frankly, I think we should avoid making a storm in a teacup.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: European Commission downplays missed handshake incident as  ustorm in a teacup u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_daeccfaccc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbcfeadfdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.

Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcaecdbcfc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbecdfae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
