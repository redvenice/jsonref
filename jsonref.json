The most expensive collection of 5,800 pogs we saw went for £215 earlier this yearIn light of the new game, we took a look on eBay to see how much original pogs were selling for. There are hundreds of listing for pogs worldwide, both limited edition pogs and general collections of them.The most valuable UK sale we found was for a collection of more than 5,800 pogs in a variety of different themes, including a Star Wars collection, which sold for £215 in March this year.          Job-lot collections of pogs are selling on eBay for an average of £20 for around 200 discsNext was a set of the special edition ‘Chupa Caps – City People Series’ in green which went for £122, then a similar set of \u0027Chupa Caps\u0027 in glow in the dark for £90.88. Several people had also sold job lots of random pogs, with one of 4,009 discs for £80.The average price of those we found were between  £20 and £50 for collections of at least a few hundred pogs, or those which contained some special edition designs. Even some unfinished sets were being sold, with one part set of the \u0027Batman Power Caps\u0027 series selling for £21 in April this year.Inidual pogs and slammers, were also selling on eBay but these are a lot less and going for an average of £1 - £2.           The new Pog game will let users scan in images of their retro pogs for in-game creditsTherefore if you do have a collection left over from the 90s, you could try your hand at selling them online. The new game is being created by the London-based firm Compton Technology which has just launched an Indigogo campaign to raise funds to design the game. The target is $50,000 and it’s reached $5,947 already with 106 backers and a month to go.The free game, named POGS AR, is due to be released in September for android and iPhone users and it’s the first officially licensed mobile game from the World Pog Federation, the biggest seller of pogs in the UK.It will include all the original features of the 90s game – including flipping and slamming – but through a mobile app.          A limited edition physical pog is available for people who back the campaign earlyUsers will be able to scan existing pogs and unlock extra content, earn physical prizes, take part in slamming matches with other players and compete in regular tournaments. For those backing the funding campaign, there will be extra perks available including a limited-edition physical slammer, special in-game content, a custom designed pog character and early access to the game.Sam Park, director of Compton Technology, said: ‘Pogs blend two things people love to do - compete and collect. \u0027But in pogs you play for keeps and must risk losing some of your collection to expand it, so the excitement and intensity increases as you play.          This collection of almost 500 pogs sold on eBay for £31 earlier this year‘By going digital and applying modern technology like AR to the original concept, we’re creating a game community and collectible ecosystem that I believe can be even bigger than the original.’  As the new game is due to launch in September,  the number of people flogging their old pogs online could increase over the next couple of months and therefore the overall value you can sell them for will go down as more people hunt theirs out to sell on. But conversely, as interest grows there may be more buyers, which could also affect the price. On the other hand, if you want to get involved with playing the new game – it could be worth hanging onto the pogs as the designers say you will be able to scan them in and use them with it.One year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/15/4CF3EC4F00000578-5818559-image-a-24_1528466664114.jpg","title":"Dennis Rodmans relationship Kim Jong revealed","story":"    Former NBA player Dennis Rodman has been close friends with Kim Jong-un since early 2013Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un’s relationshipRodman’s friendship with the North Korean leader is believed to date back to 2013 when the former NBA player traveled to North Korea with Vice Media reporter Ryan Duffy to host a series of exhibition basketball games in February 2013.Rodman met with Kim and declared him to be his ‘friend for life’ and an ‘awesome guy’ after they bonded while in the country.He later stated in an interview with Good Morning Britain: ‘I hang out with him all the time.

The drum major is poised to parade in his final Trooping the Colour on a day which will also mark the end of his four-decade career in the British Army (pictured outside the Officers Mess in Munster, 1986)Drum Major Staite also leads one of the massed bands during the parade in slow and quick time - something the father-of-two agreed very few people get to do.\u0027A lot of people tell you it is great to march behind a band, but you can\u0027t beat marching in front of it,\u0027 he said.During his career Drum Major Staite said he has visited 40 of the 50 states in America, and has worked in Kenya, Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.It was during a posting to West Berlin on his first deployment that he also patrolled the Berlin Wall and guarded Adolf Hitler\u0027s deputy, Rudolf Hess, when he was held at Spandau prison.Quizzed on what that experience was like, Drum Major Staite who plans on retiring to Middlesbrough with his wife Fee, said: \u0027You just sat in a sanger at Spandau prison.\u0027You weren\u0027t really allowed to look into the yard, it was just a normal prison with one person in it. But driving around the Berlin wall in those days was something very, very different.\u0027Posted to Household Division headquarters in 2000, he was involved in the funeral of the Queen Mother and Lady Margaret Thatcher, the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games and the royal weddings of Prince Charles and Prince William.June 9 will mark 38 years 355 days in uniform for Drum Major Staite, who described his impending last Trooping the Colour as a \u0027very special moment\u0027.He has also chosen the march the Grenadier Guards will step on to Horse Guards to, which is Wadi Al Batin - a battle honour from the 1991 Gulf War - in which he fought.\u0027Marching on to parade with the band playing Wadi al Batin for me, which is the march I chose, that will be quite emotional,\u0027 he added.Once the parade is finished Drum Major Staite said his state clothing will have to be handed back, something he said he will probably do \u0027with a tear in my eye\u0027.   Turban-wearing Coldstream Guards soldier will make history at Trooping the Colour as the first soldier to parade in Sikh headdress A Coldstream Guards soldier who will wear a turban as he parades during Trooping the Colour has said he hopes it is looked upon as a \u0027new change in history\u0027.More than 1,000 soldiers will take part in the ceremony which marks the Queen\u0027s official birthday on Saturday as the nation honours the monarch.For Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall the event is not only his first Trooping the Colour, but also marks the first time a member of the Coldstream Guards has taken part wearing a turban.The 22-year-old from Leicester told the said: \u0027I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history.\u0027I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the Army.\u0027A member of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, the turban he will be wearing during Trooping the Colour will be black, featuring the ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats.Sikh Coldstream Guard becomes the FIRST soldier to wear a...Prince Harry\u0027s stepbrother and stepsister revealed after...Former head of British forces Field Marshal Guthrie, 79, is...It\u0027s hardly Royal Ascot!

Since leaving the Army in 2015, the Prince has focused his work on the creation of the Invictus Games and Heads Together, a campaign which seeks to challenge the stigma of mental health problems.A Kensington Palace source said: ‘Harry follows these issues closely and is always keen to get information from a variety of sources.’Welcoming the Prince’s intervention, CSgt Coult, a father of one from Suffolk, promised to launch a fact-finding mission on his behalf.‘I’m delighted that Prince Harry has shown an interest at such a critical time,’ he said. ‘The number of deaths among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans this year is utterly shocking and an indictment of the failure of the Government and military charities to meet their needs.          Died at the age of 35: Christopher Butcher, with wife Laura, was diagnosed with PTSD and died last yearThe MoD doesn’t want to know how many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are killing themselves, that’s why it doesn’t collate the information itself.’The spate of suspected suicides began with Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt, 39, of the Royal Engineers, who was found hanged on January 2. His death inspired our campaign which led to the MoD setting up the Helpline For Heroes in February.It has since received hundreds of calls from troops suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. Before our campaign, officials argued such a helpline would attract 50 calls a year at most.Welcoming Harry’s involvement, Nathan’s father Derek Hunt said: ‘He knows what it is like emotionally to serve on the front line. He cares. It is a shocking reflection of the Government that there have been so many suicides among young veterans this year.’Harry served with WO Hunt in Afghanistan in early 2008 as part of a desert reconnaissance unit. Following his death, the Prince expressed his heartfelt condolences to his family. The son of former England football captain Terry Butcher, Army captain Christopher Butcher, served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was found dead aged 35 at his parents’ home last October following a battle with PTSD.          TRAGEDY OF IRAQ VET: Ex-Royal Marine Dave Evans, who served in Iraq, is suspected to have committed suicide this yearThe suspected suicides of frontline veterans this year also include an elite Special Boat Service (SBS) trooper found hanged in his room at the unit’s base in Poole, Dorset, last month, and Dave Evans, a former Marine who served in Iraq.British military operations in Iraq began in March 2003 and concluded in May 2011. During those 2,974 days, 138 soldiers were killed in hostile action. Following the 911 attacks in 2001, UK operations in Afghanistan started in October 2001. British troops marked the end of operations by handing over Camp Bastion on October 27, 2014. By then, there had been 405 deaths in hostile action over 4,775 days.The MoD said: ‘Any suicide is a tragedy. Help is available for serving personnel and veterans through the 24-hour mental health helplines and we are spending more than £20 million a year on mental health services.’  We must ALL do more to help themComment by Lord Dannatt I am not surprised Prince Harry has expressed concern about this very serious issue. Anyone who has taken part in frontline operations, as the Prince has done, would feel the same way about an increase in suicides in the veteran community.I would also commend Colour Sergeant Trevor Coult, a soldier decorated for his gallantry in Iraq, for bringing this matter to the Prince’s attention.As with the death of Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt earlier this year, any suicide, particularly that of a relatively young veteran, is one too many.There are helplines for veterans and serving personnel now, the latter following a successful campaign by The Mail on Sunday.I would appeal to the families and friends of veterans who are struggling to encourage them to seek help or to inform service charities or their GPs themselves.Don’t leave it until it is too late. Everyone close to someone in danger has a role to play.Everyone realises there is a problem but nobody is complacent. The ongoing challenge is to ensure that those who need help actually get it.We must all do more – the Government, the NHS and the military charities."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/08/4D19C0D400000578-5825717-image-a-24_1528615019459.jpg","title":"David Walliams puts 5 35M north London home market 2M paid it","story":"David Walliams has placed his north London house on the market for £2million more than her paid for it 13 years ago          The master bedroom has integrated wardrobes as well as am open-plan en-suite with a freestanding bath and plenty of open spaceThe real Lost Voice Guy: How son of a cancer nurse Lee...Share this articleThe expansive pad was where he lived with ex-wife and model Lara Stone and before that it was owned by Oasis superstar Noel Gallagher.It was dubbed Supernova heights in the nineties because of the extravagant parties its former owner threw.The house boasts a stylish living area, an extensive garden, a roof terrace and private parking.

Some suggest it started with the mass production of plastics which now intermingle with rocks in the ocean bed.In The Human Planet Lewis and Maslin suggest the dawn of colonialism as the advent of the Anthropocene.They argue that 1610 was the true start.          The arrival of Europeans in the Americas triggered the Anthropocene, the book says. Pictured: Fur traders in Canada\u0027The arrival of Europeans, in particular the British and Spanish, had a profound impact on central and southern America,\u0027 Maslin told the Observer.Settlers and soldiers carried European diseases like smallpox, measles, typhoid and the flu.These killed as many as 50 million Americans who has no resistance to their foreign illnesses.With the death of so many of the continents native people forests began to regrow where farmland had once been tended to.By using carbon dioxide readings from the period they calculated that by 1610 forests had reclaimed much of the continent.Forests are more effective at absorbing carbon dioxide than crops and therefore the reforestation of farmland would have led to a drop in carbon dioxide.          At least 50 million Americans were killed during the colonisation of the Americas. Pictured: A market in the West IndesRats and other pests carried on ships across the Atlantic had a stark effect on local species.\u0027A good example is provided by the earthworm. In the US, most of the earthworms you will find there are actually European, said Maslin.\u0027They are better at competing for nutrients. So they have taken over the soil in North America since Europeans brought them across the Atlantic in the 16th century. That is not something you can unpick. They are there for good.\u0027In turn America\u0027s own produce changed the terrain of other continents. In just decades Europeans were eating potatoes and tomatoes while Chinese and Indian cuisine has absorbed the heat of the American pepper.In China newly imported maize was planted in lands previously thought too dry to be farmed.This led to more deforestation and population increase.With the pace of technological advancement only increasing it appears the Anthropocene is here to stay.Predicting its course is difficult, the authors admit.

Supporters of President Donald Trump stand outside the Singapore prime minister\u0027s official residenceBut critics have warned it risks becoming more of a media circus than an occasion for substantial progress.The U.S. leader has whipsawed on expectations for the meeting, signalling that it could be the beginning of a \u0027process\u0027 of several meetings, only to call it a \u0027one-time shot\u0027 for peace as he embarked for Singapore and saying he would know \u0027within the first minute\u0027 whether an agreement would be possible.\u0027I just think it\u0027s going to work out very nicely,\u0027 said Trump at a working lunch with the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien-Loong.The previous U.S. stance, said Bruce Klingner of the Heritage Foundation, was that \u0027we don\u0027t deploy a president to negotiate a treaty, we deploy a president to sign a treaty where we know where every piece of punctuation is on that piece of paper.\u0027\u0027One of my worries is that we come out of this Singapore summit with something that looks remarkably like the Six Party Talks or anything that the president has previously criticised but it is hyped as something that\u0027s historic and new and groundbreaking,\u0027 he said.The North\u0027s official KCNA news agency called the summit \u0027historic,\u0027 saying it would take place in a \u0027changed era\u0027 and \u0027under the great attention and expectation of the whole world.\u0027Kim would exchange \u0027wide-ranging and profound views\u0027 on issues including \u0027building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean peninsula\u0027 and \u0027realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u0027 it added.It formally referred to Trump by his full name in the Monday report, including his middle initial -- the first time it has done so.Kim\u0027s sister and close aide Kim Yo Jong is also in Singapore, and is believed to have travelled separately on the ageing Soviet-made Ilyushin-62 that is the leader\u0027s personal aircraft."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/18/4CE7266500000578-0-image-m-8_1528131587535.jpg","title":"Passenger forces Jet2 flight divert following disgraceful behaviour blow doll in","story":"    The Jet2 plane was on its way from Belfast to Ibiza when the passenger became abusive after being refused alcohol (file picture)A Jet2 spokesman said the decision to ert was taken due \u0027the deplorable behaviour of a particularly disruptive customer\u0027, who has now been handed a lifetime ban.A woman who was on the flight with her partner and four-month-old baby told the BBC that the man was part of a \u0027large stag group\u0027 that was \u0027quite rowdy\u0027 when they came on board.First-time flier who drank to soothe his nerves and was...Pictured: Husband-to-be and his raucous stag do party who...Share this articleShe said the stag group were some of the last passengers to board the plane.\u0027The captain introduced himself and gave a really stern warning and reiterated that only alcohol bought on board could be consumed on flight and duty free can\u0027t be consumed.\u0027The passenger said the ersion doubled the length of their trip.\u0027Passengers couldn\u0027t get off the plane and it was roasting,\u0027 she said.

According to witness statements, after being woken by smoke alarms, a resident called the fire brigade just before 1am.Four fire engines arrived at the scene minutes later and as the crew dealt with the fire in the fridge freezer, flames began to grow in other areas of the kitchen and images revealed that it had spread to the cladding before the firefighters had even arrived.As the fire continued to spread, by 2am the London Fire Bridge had declared it a ‘major incident’ and at this point, around 40 fire engines were at the location or on their way. In addition to this, because of Grenfell Tower’s ‘stay put’ fire policy, many residents were told to remain in their flats by emergency services.The ‘stay put’ order was abandoned at just before 3am and 65 people were rescued from the building by firefighters, 144 managing to escape before the order was abandoned, but only 36 after. By 4:30am, the entire building was engulfed and the fire did not stop until 1am the next day.          Photo issued by the Grenfell Tower Inquiry of the kitchen in Flat 16 where the fire startedGrenfell Tower vigilWriting for the Evening Standard, Prime Minister Theresa May has revealed that she will ‘always regret’ not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower after the disaster and made it clear the belief she ‘didn’t care’ was ‘never the case’.She continued: ‘What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze. But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair.‘And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn’t care.’ The Grenfell Tower inquiry has been halted for a week so that memorials and vigils can take place to mark the anniversary.The North Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary and at 1:30am BST on Thursday, June 14, the names of all the fire’s victims will be read out at St Clement’s church.At 12pm, survivors and the bereaved will also gather near Grenfell Tower for a minute’s silence, the tower being lit green alongside 12 other tower blocks in the area, from 12:54am, the time the fire is thought to have started and will be for the following four evenings.

The pair then visited the Esplanade and crossed the Jubilee Bridge      Earlier, officials from the two sides held last-minute talks aimed at laying the groundwork for the summit between Trump and Kim, a meeting almost unthinkable just months ago when the two were exchanging insults and threats that raised fears of war.But after a flurry of diplomatic overtures eased tension in recent months, the two leaders are now headed for a history-making handshake that U.S. officials hope could eventually lead to dismantling of a North Korean nuclear programme that threatens the United States.Offering a preview to reporters on the eve of the summit, Pompeo said it could provide \u0027an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of our relationship and bring peace and prosperity\u0027 to North Korea.However, he played down the possibility of a quick breakthrough and said the summit should set the framework for \u0027the hard work that will follow\u0027, insisting that North Korea had to move toward complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.Pyongyang, though, has shown little appetite for surrendering nuclear weapons it considers vital to the survival of Kim\u0027s dynastic rule.Sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until that had happened, Pompeo said. \u0027If diplomacy does not move in the right direction ... those measures will increase.\u0027\u0027North Korea has previously confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearise and we are eager to see if those words prove sincere,\u0027 he said.

After seeing three landmarks on foot, Kim was taken on a driving tour of several other sights before calling it a night          Cameramen from the world\u0027s media, including those from North Korea, followed closely as Kim went for his sightseeing tourThe White House later said discussions with North Korea had moved \u0027more quickly than expected\u0027 and Trump would leave Singapore on Tuesday night, after the summit. He had earlier been scheduled to leave on Wednesday.Kim is due to leave on Tuesday afternoon, a source involved in the planning of his visit to Singapore, said on Sunday.Trump arrived in Singapore on Sunday after a blow-up over trade with other members of the Group of Seven major industrialised nations in Canada.The escalating economic clash between Washington and some of its closest global partners cast a cloud over Trump\u0027s efforts to score a major foreign policy win in nuclear talks with North Korea, long one of America\u0027s bitterest foes.Although gaps remain over what denuclearisation would entail, Trump sounded a positive note in a lunch meeting with Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\u0027We\u0027ve got a very interesting meeting ... tomorrow, and I just think it\u0027s going to work out very nicely,\u0027 Trump said.It was a far cry from last year when Trump threatened North Korea with \u0027fire and fury\u0027 and mocked Kim as \u0027little rocket man,\u0027 and Kim denounced the U.S. president as the \u0027mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\u0027Kim Jong Un takes surprise nighttime tour of Singapore"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/09/4D0A8E2B00000578-5820445-Chancellor_Sebastian_Kurz_said-a-14_1528446722486.jpg","title":"Erdogan denounces Austrian decision close mosques","story":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted Ankara would \u0027have to do something\u0027 in response to Austria\u0027s decision to close mosques and expel Turkish-funded imams          Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (pictured) said the Austrian government would be shutting a hardline Turkish nationalist mosque in Vienna and dissolving a group called the Arab Religious CommunityInterior Minister Herbert Kickl of the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), the junior partner in Austria\u0027s coalition government said the move concerned imams with alleged links to the Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations (ATIB) organisation, a branch of Turkey\u0027s religious affairs agency Diyanet.Kickl added the government suspects them of contravening a ban on foreign funding of religious office holders.A Turkish presidential spokesman had on Friday described the Austrian move as \u0027a reflection of the anti-Islam, racist and discriminatory populist wave in this country\u0027.Austria\u0027s right-wing government plans to shut down seven...\u0027It was EASY\u0027: Prankster who duped Foreign Secretary Boris...Boris Johnson spent 18 minutes speaking to prank callers...Share this articleHowever, other European far-right leaders welcomed the announcement.Even Austria\u0027s opposition parties were broadly supportive of Friday\u0027s announcement, with the centre-left Social Democrats calling it \u0027the first sensible thing this government\u0027s done\u0027.But the Green Party pointed out it could serve as a propaganda victory for the Turkish government.

The East India Company ship President met her end in February 1684, and only two crew members remained alive to tell the taleBut that victory was followed by misery and defeat, as weather prohibited the crew from landing to restock provisions.For 11 weeks they went without food and water, and in the end resorted to eating the ship\u0027s dog - which was described as \u0027a delicate banquet\u0027.With the crew in a weakened state they were unable to work the ship, and the President was swept into a storm just off the Cornish Coast, in Mount\u0027s Bay.The ship sank with \u0027very rich lading, modestly judged of no less than a hundred thousand pounds * with much treasure of pearl, and diamonds\u0027.

Some suggest it started with the mass production of plastics which now intermingle with rocks in the ocean bed.In The Human Planet Lewis and Maslin suggest the dawn of colonialism as the advent of the Anthropocene.They argue that 1610 was the true start.          The arrival of Europeans in the Americas triggered the Anthropocene, the book says. Pictured: Fur traders in Canada\u0027The arrival of Europeans, in particular the British and Spanish, had a profound impact on central and southern America,\u0027 Maslin told the Observer.Settlers and soldiers carried European diseases like smallpox, measles, typhoid and the flu.These killed as many as 50 million Americans who has no resistance to their foreign illnesses.With the death of so many of the continents native people forests began to regrow where farmland had once been tended to.By using carbon dioxide readings from the period they calculated that by 1610 forests had reclaimed much of the continent.Forests are more effective at absorbing carbon dioxide than crops and therefore the reforestation of farmland would have led to a drop in carbon dioxide.          At least 50 million Americans were killed during the colonisation of the Americas. Pictured: A market in the West IndesRats and other pests carried on ships across the Atlantic had a stark effect on local species.\u0027A good example is provided by the earthworm. In the US, most of the earthworms you will find there are actually European, said Maslin.\u0027They are better at competing for nutrients. So they have taken over the soil in North America since Europeans brought them across the Atlantic in the 16th century. That is not something you can unpick. They are there for good.\u0027In turn America\u0027s own produce changed the terrain of other continents. In just decades Europeans were eating potatoes and tomatoes while Chinese and Indian cuisine has absorbed the heat of the American pepper.In China newly imported maize was planted in lands previously thought too dry to be farmed.This led to more deforestation and population increase.With the pace of technological advancement only increasing it appears the Anthropocene is here to stay.Predicting its course is difficult, the authors admit.

Supporters of President Donald Trump stand outside the Singapore prime minister\u0027s official residenceBut critics have warned it risks becoming more of a media circus than an occasion for substantial progress.The U.S. leader has whipsawed on expectations for the meeting, signalling that it could be the beginning of a \u0027process\u0027 of several meetings, only to call it a \u0027one-time shot\u0027 for peace as he embarked for Singapore and saying he would know \u0027within the first minute\u0027 whether an agreement would be possible.\u0027I just think it\u0027s going to work out very nicely,\u0027 said Trump at a working lunch with the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien-Loong.The previous U.S. stance, said Bruce Klingner of the Heritage Foundation, was that \u0027we don\u0027t deploy a president to negotiate a treaty, we deploy a president to sign a treaty where we know where every piece of punctuation is on that piece of paper.\u0027\u0027One of my worries is that we come out of this Singapore summit with something that looks remarkably like the Six Party Talks or anything that the president has previously criticised but it is hyped as something that\u0027s historic and new and groundbreaking,\u0027 he said.The North\u0027s official KCNA news agency called the summit \u0027historic,\u0027 saying it would take place in a \u0027changed era\u0027 and \u0027under the great attention and expectation of the whole world.\u0027Kim would exchange \u0027wide-ranging and profound views\u0027 on issues including \u0027building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean peninsula\u0027 and \u0027realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u0027 it added.It formally referred to Trump by his full name in the Monday report, including his middle initial -- the first time it has done so.Kim\u0027s sister and close aide Kim Yo Jong is also in Singapore, and is believed to have travelled separately on the ageing Soviet-made Ilyushin-62 that is the leader\u0027s personal aircraft."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/10/4D12E6E300000578-0-image-m-24_1528535054301.jpg","title":"Adopted man gets life saving op reunited family Davina McCall show","story":"     Marion Williams (left) and James McDonnell (right), 65, were reunited with their son Simon Day (centre), 45, of Torquay, Devon, on ITV\u0027s Long Lost Family: What Happened NextA doctor found web designer Mr Day had four blocked arteries and required an immediate quadruple bypass, reported The Sun.Mr Day, who was reunited with his relatives last July, said: \u0027There\u0027s no question that by finding me and warning me, my dad saved my life.\u0027Family pay tribute to \u0027fun-loving and bubbly\u0027 four-year-old...Doctors who make \u0027honest mistakes\u0027 won\u0027t be charged under...Share this articleMr Day, who was given up for adoption as a baby by Mr McDonnell and his mother Marion Williams, has now made a full recovery.He added: \u0027James told me we had to find you, because you\u0027re a ticking timebomb.

Sauvage. Icon. Barbie doll: the grotesque exploitation of Frida Kahlo... and the artist behind the mythsFrida, the unapologetic bitch. Frida, the disabled artist. Frida, symbol of radical feminism. Frida, the victim of Diego. Frida, the chic, gender-fluid, beautiful and monstrous icon. Frida tote bags, Frida keychains, Frida T-shirts, And also, this year’s new Frida Barbie doll (no unibrow). Frida Kahlo has been subject to global scrutiny and commercial exploitation. She has been appropriated by curators, historians, artists, actors, activists, Mexican consulates, museums and Madonna.Over the years, this avalanche has trivialised Kahlo’s work to fit a shallow “Fridolatry”. And, while some criticism has been able to counter the views that cast her as a naive, infantile, almost involuntary artist, most narratives have continued to position her as a geographically marginal painter: one more developing-world artist waiting to be “discovered”, one more voiceless subject waiting to be “translated”.In 1938, Frida Kahlo painted Lo que el agua me dio (What the Water Gave Me), the painting perhaps responsible for launching her international career, but also her international mistranslation. In this self-portrait of sorts, we see Kahlo’s feet and calves inside a bathtub and above them, as if emanating from the steam, a collaged landscape: an erupting volcano out of which a skyscraper emerges a dead bird resting on a tree a strangled woman a Tehuana dress dramatically spread out a female couple resting on a floating cork. Kahlo was working on Lo que el agua me dio when the French surrealist André Breton arrived in Mexico for a visit. He was transfixed by it. He called Kahlo a “natural surrealist”, and in a brochure endorsing her New York debut at Julien Levy’s gallery in 1938, he wrote: “My surprise and joy were unbounded when I discovered, on my arrival in Mexico, that her work has blossomed forth, in her latest paintings, into pure surreality, despite the fact that it had been conceived without any prior knowledge whatsoever of the ideas motivating the activities of my friends and myself.”Though “natural surrealist” was a label that helped translate Kahlo’s paintings for European and American audiences, it was one that she always rejected. To be projected as a “surrealist” in Europe helped audiences to understand her work more immediately – more palatably. She was branded as authentically Mexican, with international flair. But to be seen as a “natural surrealist” also transformed her into a kind of sauvage: unconscious of her talent, unsuspecting of her mastery. After her debut, a Time magazine critic described her work as having “the daintiness of miniatures, the vivid reds and yellows of Mexican tradition and the playfully bloody fancy of an unsentimental child.”Kahlo was hardly unsuspecting, hardly unconscious of what she was doing and who she was. She knew how to capitalise on the elements of her private life and cultural heritage, curate them carefully, and use them to build her public persona. She was a mestizo, born in Mexico City, who had adopted a traditional Zapotec-Tehuana “look”. Her father, the German-born Carl Wilhelm “Guillermo” Kahlo, was a well-known photographer, and the family lived in a neocolonial mansion in Coyoacán, the famous Casa Azul. Kahlo was very much aware of the complex politics of selfhood she was creating and manipulating. In a 1939 photograph taken during the opening of Kahlo’s first exhibition in Paris, she is posing in front of Lo que el agua me dio. She is wearing a Tehuana dress and her unibrow is underscored with black eyeliner: Frida representing Frida. (It is unclear which one is the artwork.)The way Kahlo’s work and persona were read in Mexico was of course very different from the way they were translated into other cultural milieux. Just as Breton had attached the category “natural surrealist” to her art and framed her work in a discourse that she herself did not embrace, many others did the same with various aspects of her public and private life.An interesting example of this is the house and studio in Mexico City where she and Diego Rivera lived and worked during some of their most productive years in the 1930s. It was designed by Juan O’Gorman, the young architect who was then pioneering the radical architectural changes that took place in post-revolutionary Mexico City.Before the Mexican Revolution (1910-20), 19th-century neoclassical and colonial architecture dominated. French-influenced mansions across the city stood like lonely homages to a quickly decaying European noble class, and the family life of the Mexican bourgeoisie played out in the sumptuous and darkened stages of these interiors, with their heavy drapes and excessive ornamentation. But after the revolution new ideas about hygiene, ventilation, comfort, efficiency and simplicity made their way into the city. Houses, and with them daily life, were transformed radically and rapidly.Attuned to the ideological and architectural changes taking place, the couple asked O’Gorman to design a studio and house for them. He created a space specifically for a couple of painters – at once separated and connected. The buildings were the first in Mexico designed for specific functional requirements: living, painting and showcasing work.In 1933, a few years after Kahlo and Rivera married, they moved in. Rivera’s area was larger, with more work space. Kahlo’s was more “homely”, with a studio that could transform into a bedroom. A flight of stairs led from her studio to a rooftop, which was connected by a bridge to Rivera’s space. Beyond being a workplace, it became a space for the couple’s extramarital affairs: Rivera, with his models and secretaries Kahlo, with certain talented and famous men, from the sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi to Leon Trotsky. Perhaps without knowing it, O’Gorman designed a house whose function it was to allow an “open” relationship.The house was an emblem of modernity and a kind of manifesto: a solitary example of a new functionalism in a city that was still trying to find a national architectural language that best suited its revolutionary programme. It did not encode traditional values or messages. It simply addressed the practical necessities of its dwellers, was materially efficient (primarily made of reinforced concrete), socially progressive and cheap.With time, however, as neutral as the buildings may have been intended to be in their architecture, they ended up functioning as a site of Mexican cultural capital, especially one connected to indigenous Mexican craftsmanship. The couple were hosts to visitors who came to see their work and works-in-progress, as well as their collections of arts and crafts: Trotsky, Nelson Rockefeller, Pablo Neruda, John Dos Passos, Sergei Eisenstein, Breton.O’Gorman gave Rivera and Kahlo a machine to live in, as Le Corbusier would have had it, but also a machine to translate in. Their home brought in foreignness as much as it served as a platform to project a particular idea of Mexico to the world. More than anything, it provided the stage for the power couple of Mexican modernity: cosmopolitan, sophisticated, well-connected and more Mexican than Mexico. The couple’s ultimate oeuvre was, of course, themselves. Kahlo and Rivera were, perhaps, Mexico’s first performance artists, and their casa-estudio was their very own gallery.The buildings were designed to embody a proletkult ideology, resembling a factory or industrial complex, with its visible water tanks, its exposed materials and raised supporting columns. The cacti fence surrounding the house, if seen in relation to it, added to the general industrial feeling. However, Harper’s chose the image that best decontextualised the cacti fence and thus presented it as a folkloric, decorative element. To the right of that central image appeared a series of photographs of barefooted Mexican peasants selling crafts and riding mules.An accompanying piece written by Harry Block – a New York editor – describes his search for the perfect Mexican sandals: “All Mexico walks on huaraches (pronounced wahratchehs and meaning sandals) …” Juxtaposed with the portrait of Rivera and Kahlo – he, dressed like a European dandy, solid leather shoes included she, wearing pointy black boots – Block’s ode to the huarache seems rather forced.The Harper’s piece is a perfect example of how Mexico was perpetuated in such stories as a marginal space, with glimpses of modernity a rare exception to the rule. The magazine shows an utterly foreign Mexico, but in a way that also makes it easier to capture and explain to foreign audiences through its associated cliches. It is a form of translation that simplifies the complex operations that took place in the Rivera-Kahlo home.A functionalist Mexican house that showcased post-revolutionary art? Impossible! Let’s just use the picture with the cacti.This instance of colonising narratives in cultural translations was not the end but the beginning. In 2002, Harvey Weinstein’s company distributed the film Frida, starring Salma Hayek, asked for a more-sexy Kahlo – more nudity, less unibrow – and got away with it. In a 2016 concert stunt in Mexico, Madonna pulled a Frida lookalike from the audience, said she was “so excited” to finally meet Frida, and then handed her a banana as a token.Last Halloween, my 21-year-old niece was dragged by her friend to a New York college party. She wasn’t wearing a costume, was not really in the mood. At some point, a trio of Wonder Women stumbled in: red knee-high boots, star print bikini-bottoms, strapless tops, gold headbands fastened around long blond hair.One of the three wonders took a long swig from a bottle and almost fell back, suddenly noticing my niece, standing behind her. She turned round and looked straight into her face. She studied it up close. Like many women in my maternal family, my niece inherited a dark, robust unibrow. The Wonder Woman finally said: “Oh my god, it’s Frida Kahlo!”.• Valeria Luiselli’s Tell Me How It Ends is published by 4th Estate.

The manufacturer said it would also be investing in its plant at Halewood, Merseyside, to build the next generation Range Rover Evoque.In the short-term, more work than anticipated will move to JLR’s new £1bn facility in Nitra, Slovakia, which is due to open at the end of the year. JLR, owned by the Indian company Tata, had already signalled it would move a large amount of the production on the Discovery, which sold about 45,000 units last year, the lowest volume of the five models built in Solihull. In a statement, JLR said: “This significant investment and technology upgrade in Solihull in order to accommodate our next-generation of flagship Land Rover models, and the refit of our Halewood plant for the next Evoque, is proof that we remain committed both to the UK and to transformation and growth.“The decision to move the Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia and the potential losses of some agency employed staff in the UK is a tough one but forms part of our long-term manufacturing strategy as we transform our business globally.”JLR said the move was unconnected to the Brexit headwinds that led to it announcing 1,000 UK jobs would go in April. Its profits have also been dented by the slump in diesel sales.The company has said it would make an electric option for each of its new models after 2020. David Bailey, the professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: “There has been speculation locally that they needed to free up space to make electric vehicles. There was concern that their first electric car, the I-Pace, was being made in Austria – people wanted that built here. “If this move on the Discovery means producing electric cars here, overall that is a good thing. We want to see that transition to a low-carbon economy in the Midlands and we want to see the jobs here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1e0d6d04a1423dbbe54692129a1247b48147ffb/20_0_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbed2f2caec81f44984c6c02652fec24","title":"poundworld administration jobs high street","story":"Talks to rescue retailer fail in latest blow for Britain’s struggling high street•Full list of Poundworld storesPoundworld has collapsed into administration, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk, after rescue talks failed over the weekend.It is the latest blow for Britain’s struggling high streets, where a string of retailers and restaurants have shrunk or collapsed due to rising costs and a consumer spending squeeze.Poundworld, which has 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. Deloitte, which was appointed as administrator on Friday, said Poundworld would trade as usual while it sought a buyer for all or part of the business, adding that no redundancies or store closures were planned.At Poundworld in Hyde, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain’s demise. “What a shame,” said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. “If someone comes to nick my chickens they’re not to know it’s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes,” she said.Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny: “At Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for £1. It’s £1.50 at the supermarket,” she said.Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of glow sticks for £1 each and some bin bags. She said: “I didn’t think a place like this would close. I’m in every week buying things I don’t need.”Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie’s Yorkshire pudding mix.One of Poundworld’s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetics outlet. Next to that is B\u0026ampM Bargains, a northern chain that recently announced plans to open 45 stores in southern England. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Jack Fulton, the Yorkshire frozen food retaile , and it’s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice.Two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with the private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with Poundworld’s owners, TPG Capital, a US private equity firm.Chris Edwards, who founded the business in Wakefield, Yorkshire, in 1974 before selling it to TPG for £150m, is also thought to have been interested in buying back the business.Deloitte’s joint administrator, Clare Boardman, said: “The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. “Unfortunately, this has not been possible. We still believe a buyer can be found for the business, or at least part of it, and we are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen. We thank all employees for their support at this difficult time.A TPG spokesperson said: “This was a difficult decision for every party involved. We invested in Poundworld because of our belief in how the company serves its customers and the strength of its employees. “Despite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and changing consumer behaviour affected Poundworld significantly.”The retail analyst Nick Bubb said the relative health of Poundworld’s rival Poundland, despite a crowded marketplace for discount retailers, indicated the business had been poorly managed.“Poundland is doing OK, despite the general pressure on the high street pound chains from the growth of B\u0026ampM and Home Bargains in food and toiletries and the growth of Aldi and Lidl,” he said.“So it must be down to management, and I suspect Poundworld lost a lot of momentum when the founder, Chris Edwards, stepped back from the business.”The demise of Poundworld follows the collapse into administration this year of the electronics firm Maplin and Toys R Us.The high street has also been rocked by a succession of retailers and restaurant chains announcing plans to shut stores amid tougher trading conditions.House of Fraser announced plans last week to close 31 stores, putting a further 6,000 jobs at risk. Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright are closing dozens of outlets after creditors approved company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), insolvency procedures that enable them to reduce rents and shut shops.Restaurants including Prezzo, the burger chain Byron and Jamie’s Italian have also closed outlets using the process.Poundworld’s problems surfaced in April when its owner was said to be considering launching a CVA, affecting about 100 stores."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f12b1e205081c529fa0652f81fc8e5edab6707a7/0_327_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3b46bd2b891572badca9987036b6804","title":"brexit uk fishermen fishing industry quotas uk government","story":"Pericles, Prince of Tyre, Act 2, scene 1:Third Fisherman: Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.First Fisherman: Why, as men do a-land the great ones eat up the little ones.William Shakespeare might have been writing about the 21st-century fishing industry. Forget, for a moment, “taking back our waters”. The real scandal in British and European fisheries over the past 35 years has been the relentless hoovering up of catching opportunities by big boats and big companies.Ukip, Conservative Brexiteers and some fishermen’s leaders would like you to believe that the important battleground in European fishing is Britain versus the rest. It is not.A more damaging issue, one that transcends national boundaries, is “big” versus “small”. In several EU countries, but most notably in Britain, powerful trawlers and large fishing interests have squeezed out the smaller, more environmentally friendly boats on which local communities depend.None of this is directly “caused” by the existence of the much-maligned EU fisheries policy. Nor is it certain – despite glittering promises by the UK and Scottish governments – that Brexit will bring much relief to coastal fishermen.A much-delayed fisheries white paper, now expected this month, will set out the government’s vision of an independent British fishing policy post-Brexit. Drafts circulating within the fishing industry are as slippery as freshly caught mackerel.On the one hand, the document says, the government is open to “alternative approaches to the future allocation of quota”. On the other hand, it promises to “recognise” the “business model” which has allowed big fishing companies to buy up (from other fishermen) an indecently large share of catching opportunities in Britain. The same pattern can be observed in some, but not all, other EU fishing countries.Such accumulations run directly contrary to the principles laid down by the common fisheries policy (CPF). Article 17 of the CFP bans “dominant positions” and calls on member states to allocate their fish quotas according, among other things, to “the impact of fishing on the environment” and “the contribution to the local economy”.The investigation, entitled Fishy Business in the EU, found that one of the English POs belonged, in effect, to a single Dutch company. Another, the Fleetwood PO, is dominated by UK fishing companies controlled by Spanish interests.It is the small-scale skippers and coastal communities who are struggling with operating profits close to zero. This is due not to competition from European boats (with local exceptions in the Channel) but to the failure of UK governments to challenge the “eating up” of quotas by big fishing interests.Much the same accumulation of quotas has occurred in Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland. There is a healthier balance in France and in non-EU Norway. Paris and Oslo forbid the private “ownership” of quotas, which is not enforced by the EU, as some fishermen’s leaders claim.Some degree of concentration of the fishing industry is inevitable and desirable. Small scale-fishermen have a limited range processing factories cannot be built all around the coastline. The present egregious imbalance between big and small interests is unhealthy: it destroys small coastal communities and hands over entire fish stocks to high-impact – ie more destructive – types of fishing.Until a few months ago, Michael Gove and others were implying – absurdly – that this great new share-out of fish would happen the day after Britain left the EU in March next year. This was always implausible. All the same, coastal fishermen feel betrayed by the government’s decision to delay the alleged quota bonanza until the end of the Brexit transition.In theory, this will last to December 2020. The Irish border issue and pressures from British industry and agriculture now suggest that transition may last for up to seven years – or indefinitely.Jerry Percy, chairman of the Coastal Producer Organisation, which was created to acquire more quota for local fishermen in the UK, says the time has come to put aside the Brexit rhetoric. If Michael Gove and others are really concerned about the survival of “iconic” coastal communities, they need to act now and within existing rules, he says.“Unless something concrete and dramatic is done to help in the immediate future then the ever-more seemingly ephemeral promises of a post-Brexit windfall of quota and access will be meaningless to those small-scale coastal fishermen who have gone out of business,” he said.What can be done? The government has transferred small amounts of “unused” quota from big interests to small in the past. In 2013, one of the big fisheries producer organisations challenged these transfers in the British courts and lost. The final judgment reluctantly accepted that fish quotas were private property but suggested that the legality of this ownership was “built on sand”.If the government really cared about small fishermen, it could make emergency transfers of more unused quotas. It could follow the Danish example and move a small proportion of quotas away from private ownership. It could, some experts have suggested, apply a kind of “quantitative easing” to the fishing industry by simply printing more quota allocation licences.As Percy suggests, it is time for the government to do something to rescue small fishermen rather than treating them as expendable bait on the Brexit hook.• John Lichfield is a former EU correspondent based in France"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d345a5d0955e876e81cdfff9e7f1e1c87845915f/0_6_2854_1713/master/2854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfda08c47aa221f89dc9e80fb74b66c","title":"trans child be himself understand community","story":"Media discussions about transgender people have taken on a personal significance for me. My son was my daughter until last year, when, after years of hints here and there, and months of him being uncharacteristically tearful and reclusive, he told us he was a boy.My instinct was caution, determined to shield him from wounding words and quizzical looks and the need to navigate out of this if he was wrong. I said, “Let’s not tell anyone at school just yet. You’re only 12. I promise I believe that you believe you’re a boy right now, but what if you tell your friends and then realise you’ve made a mistake?”I worried about boyfriends, girlfriends, online bullying and long memories. My happy child, always off exploring with hordes of kids, might be left behind, too weird to be in the gang. He was quiet, but determined, questioned how long he had to wait. I said until half-term – a few weeks away –and if you still feel the same then, I’ll talk to school about you wearing the boys’ uniform.What I didn’t know then is that people don’t just change their minds about this. I’ve researched and researched and found nothing but evidence confirming that once a person, young or old, comes out, explains their gender isn’t all it seems, that’s that. It isn’t a mistake, a cry for help, or a mental illness – it’s a fact. And the time it most commonly comes to light is when puberty arrives. It’s all so obvious now – it wasn’t then – but the time physical difference becomes apparent is the time the distress of gender dysphoria becomes acute.A week later, a call from school – my son, so upset he couldn’t speak, had gone to a trusted teacher. He couldn’t bear to be thought of as a girl for one more minute. He was a boy, he wanted to dress as a boy, he didn’t want a red pen cross on his Spanish homework when he’d used the masculine to describe himself. We met with his open-minded, compassionate teachers. I was still urging caution – nothing public, not yet, please, just a little more thinking time. What about peers’ reactions? We mustn’t rush. He explained, through tears, that he would rather people bullied him about being a boy than have to carry on pretending he was a girl.And the penny dropped.My son, in his distress, helped me realise that there is something even worse than being abused in the street, and that’s being told by strangers you’re not who you know you are, that the truth of you is not acceptable so if you want to be safe – be normal, please. Being thought of as funny-looking, a weak man or a manly, ugly woman, the titanic social pressure to look your gender, physical discomfort, even pain, are a small price to pay. A baggy jumper in summer heat, chest binders, hormone blockers, side-effects, surgery being more likely to attempt suicide, be homeless, be the victim of violent crime, murder, sexual assault. Certain countries wholly out of bounds, a crime to be you, violence inevitable, media debates that aren’t kind, that make your mother flinch and rush to switch the radio off, change the subject, protect you. Having to be tolerant of intolerance, taking deep breaths and bracing yourself, standing tall – they don’t know how fast your heart is beating, how much your palms are sweating.If you could avoid all that and happily pretend you’re a girl when you know you’re a boy – why wouldn’t you? “Mum, if I could, I probably would, but I can’t because it isn’t who I am.” And there’s the rub – it’s not a choice, it’s a truth. And it can be wonderful.School arranged PE with the other boys, “he” not “she” – and the boys’ uniform, he left the house wearing that and the broadest of smiles. He changed his name – just one letter, but a clear mark of boyhood, a farewell to girlhood. He joined the LGBTQ+ group at school – as did every single one of his magnificent friends. I called his friends’ parents and explained we were proud of him, this wasn’t a dark secret to be discussed in hushed tones. Beautiful reactions from one and all. We are lucky, I know. One offered a friend whose son was transgender and did I want to be put in touch, others asked what they could read to learn more another, unprompted, gave our school WhatsApp group a gender-neutral title, and a mum of a trans child told me about Gendered Intelligence, a life-saving organisation with a trans youth club. I’ve never seen a child look so delighted as my son on his first visit.There will of course be struggles aplenty ahead – even the strong, proud trans role models my son has face a daily struggle. Just being themselves is an act of political controversy. And my son worries for his trans peers. He told me about a friend whose parents don’t accept his gender, that it would be such a relief for him to have a kind place to go, that didn’t cost money, where everyone was nice to him even if he’s wearing boys’ clothes.Then I heard about efforts to create such a place – the LGBTQ+ community centre volunteers are crowdfunding and working hard to set up an open, accessible space for LGBTQ+ people in London. What a door opened for us when we found them. They don’t even have a building, but the community they’ve created already has been transformative: advice about our legal rights, solidarity at moments of struggle, hugs, picnics, real understanding from people who’ve been riding this wave for years. My son spent bank holiday Monday in a park, chatting to an open and generous person who was able to answer all his questions from personal experience. We’re part of a community now – it’s uplifting and gives me hope for a more compassionate future, one where we aren’t the subject of a vitriolic debate.• Molly Mulready is a lawyer and mother of three"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6bd49ac02f186f69e99cd6bafa0f3e140d1ac77/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f972cbf8641d5482705bd76df31d8145","title":"how 3d printers became hollywoods favorite gimmick","story":"Ocean’s 8 and Hotel Artemis are the latest to use far-fetched technology to progress plotsScreenwriters in a jam can hit a new panic button. It’s the switch on the nearest 3D printer. This nifty new technology, which took its first substantial silver screen bow in 2006’s Mission: Impossible III, has surfaced in three recent motion pictures. And in each case not a moment too soon. It’s enough to make you think there’s a contraption somewhere in the Hollywood hills that spits out storytelling solutions.Think back to early February and the release (more like escape) of The Cloverfield Paradox, a movie that announced itself fully formed on Netflix the night of the Super Bowl. It’s set 10 years in the future, aboard a space station (and in a parallel universe? Or were we the parallel universe?) where things go haywire in a knockoff Alien manner. A Russian engineer loses his mind a bit when he discovers interplanetary parasites under his skin (you blame him?) and when he is “contacted” by his alternate (evil?) self, he renders up a 3D-printed gun and bullets. He dies before anyone can ask “How did you get a gun schematic programmed in there?” Oh, if only John Malkovich had access to a gizmo like this – he wouldn’t have spent so long molding a plastic pistol to get past Clint Eastwood and assassinate the president in In the Line of Fire. The just-opened Hotel Artemis, a John Wick-meets-Marvel’s Night Nurse movie about a black market hospital for criminals, is also set 10 years in the future. Jodie Foster (whose last film, Elysium, was also a medical sci-fi actioner, so fingers crossed for that hat-trick!) runs the place, and one of the gadgets she’s got is a 3D printer for internal organs. (I imagine a hospital owning one is like motels from the 1980s proudly declaring “Yes, we have HBO!”) In an attempt to keep this somewhat rooted in reality, the machine can only reproduce what’s fed into it. So if a heavy smoker offers up a lung, its duplicate will be just as dark and damaged. I mean, even on Star Trek a dermal regenerator could only do so much. The biggest doozy, however, comes in this past weekend’s number one film, Ocean’s 8. Set in the here and now, the slick female-led ode to photogenic larceny is a sister film (literally! Sandra Bullock plays George Clooney’s sister) to the previous, popular Ocean’s integer movies. It has its pros, namely the look, the attitude, the costumes and Anne Hathaway playing a tweaked version of her own persona. It also has its weaknesses, specifically a master plan that isn’t all that masterly.Bullock’s Debbie Ocean spent five years in the clink mapping out the perfect crime, and so much of it is uninspired. (The best part, visually, is Awkwafina zipping in and out of a security camera’s gaze in a swift manner. This takes five years to plan?) Part of Debbie’s scheme is just, uh, hoping a washed-up clothing designer with no criminal background will want to join the team, plus a backup plan that their mark (who is very wealthy and doesn’t need a big score) will also, you know, want to join the team. I mean, I get it: Rihanna, Mindy Kaling and Cate Blanchett are really cool. I’d want to join the team, too. We all would! But is this enough?The crux of the plan involves swapping out the world’s largest and most heavily guarded diamond necklace. How to do that? Well, that will take some crafty ersion tactics (set to some boutique hotel-ready breakbeats) but also a fundamentally lazy one. Once Helena Bonham Carter’s magical camera-glasses can scan and upload the dimensions of the necklace to the team, all you need to do, apparently, is hit “go” on a 3D printer and you’ve got one that’ll fake everybody out. I suppose it is possible that a 3D printer could get a job like this done. My only personal experience with this technology was at a party where a friend’s husband had one – he said he’d make me a little dragon for my desk, but by the time I was ready to leave only a third of it was completed. (It was just a head and a neck, then some plasti-mush.) What’s more depressing, though, is that it just screams shortcut. And screams it rather boringly. We all laughed when Jeff Goldblum uploaded a virus from his Macbook to the Independence Day mothership at a time when wifi was still a dream. Back then you could barely play Hunt the Wumpus on a Mac if the floppy (that’s right I said floppy) was meant for a PC. But that didn’t stop the onslaught of bad computing protocols in adventure cinema that plagued us in the early years. Until 3D printers are inexpensive enough for everyone to have their own, we should expect a lot more of these prefab narrative tricks.

If Argentina 0-1 Cameroon was the most seismic opening result of any World Cup, there is arguably no more famous a foul in finals history than the one Benjamin Massing, the west African nation’s huge central defender, effected on Caniggia, the long-haired Argentina forward, with two minutes remaining of the tournament’s curtain-raiser at San Siro on 8 June 1990. It is certainly hard to think of a more laughably blatant one.Not for Massing the sly rake of studs down calf or other such acts of cunningly disguised destructiveness. No, this was full-frontal stuff, cartoonish in its crudeness. Here, the flying Caniggia evades two green shirts but then, splat – the haulage truck, aka Massing, flies into the frame and simply wipes him out.“It’s a nice thing for me,” says Massing with a grin. “Wherever I go, it’s: ‘Ah, he’s the one who did the tackle on Caniggia.’ Everywhere. Everyone says it to me, even when I went to Equatorial Guinea a few years ago for the Africa Cup of Nations. It’s what people recognise me for. So I have to say, it’s affection I get more than anything else, and if it was a source of money, I’d be a rich man.”The cheetah-quick Caniggia had picked the ball up five yards outside his own box. He had passed Kundé as he crossed the halfway line, then hurdled – just – the raised boot of Ndip. Ndip’s nibble had left him striving to regain full balance and his head was down and arms flailing as Massing steamed in.“I was marking Diego Maradona but I left him,” he says. “I thought: ‘If he’s got time to get his balance and pass the ball, we’re stuffed.’ That’s why I came in on him like a truck. I got to Caniggia and flew in on him. I wasn’t thinking that clearly. I was a bit wound up that he’d got past my two colleagues. Knowing that he was breaking clear, and about to get his head up, that was going to be dangerous. And that’s why I really went for it.”He really did. “No leavy go” is what Massing’s defensive partner Ndip, from the Anglophone south-west of Cameroon, would shout at the French-speaking Massing in pidgin English during matches: don’t let him go. There was no leavy go for poor Caniggia.Massing claims he once ran 100m in 10.1sec. In he flew, landing on the Argentinian’s left foot and sending him skidding across the turf. Five Argentina players rushed over to protest to the referee Michel Vautrot, as Massing bent down to pull back on the boot which had left his foot with the force of his challenge.None of the World Cup’s 13 previous opening matches had witnessed a red card. This one had now seen two, with Massing following team-mate André Kana-Biyik into the dressing room. Kana-Biyik thought the match must be over at the sight of his team-mate. “He starts raising his arms and he’s expecting me to do the same,” Massing recalls. “He says: ‘What’s going on?’ So I tell him: ‘No. They’ve sent me off too’.”To underline the size of the shock witnessed by the crowd of 73,780, it is worth noting no team from south of the Sahara had ever won a World Cup finals match before. Three Maghreb nations had – Tunisia in 1978, Algeria in 1982, and Morocco in 1986 – but this was a first for black Africa. And they had not beaten just any team. Rather, in front of 150 countries watching around the world, Cameroon had upset Maradona’s Argentina: the holders felled by the 500-1 outsiders.The impact of Senegal’s scalping of reigning champions France in the opening game of South KoreaJapan 2002 does not compare. Then, Senegal had a starting XI made up entirely of players based in France (compared with only one Ligue 1 player for Les Bleus). Cameroon’s 1990 team, by contrast, included five home-based players, officially termed as amateurs. Only five of their 22-man squad played top-level football abroad. François Omam-Biyik, their match-winner, had – like Massing – spent the preceding season in France’s second tier.For Cameroon, it was the springboard for their history-making run to the quarter-finals. Moreover, it was a match that set the tone perfectly for what was to follow at Italia 90. There was controversy, drama, brutality. There were pantomime heroes and villains. And, at the end of it, huge headlines.To review the action through the softer prism of 21st-century sensibilities invites the occasional shudder, and sympathy for Maradona, who rises wearily off the turf more than once, with something approaching stoicism. The final foul count read Cameroon 28 Argentina 9. Each of substitute Caniggia’s first four runs earned a clattering, with Massing’s crushing contribution still to come.Not that the crowd, who had whistled loudly through Argentina’s anthem, cared. The two red-carded Cameroonians left the pitch to cheers.To the Milanese, Maradona, who had just taken the Serie A title down to Naples, was the bogeyman. When Napoli collapsed spectacularly – and, some suggested, suspiciously – in the 1988 title race, Maradona said: “Today, the racist Italy has won.” During Argentina’s preparatory camp in Austria, he had returned to the same theme, speaking of Napoli’s title triumph as “the revenge of the south against the racist north”.The Argentina captain mined the same seam with his sardonic response following this opening upset: “The only pleasure I got this afternoon was to discover that, thanks to me, the people of Milan have stopped being racist. Today, for the first time, they supported the Africans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42379467867ac42efbadc420e18eb7b04399cd0/0_81_3734_2240/master/3734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e04f38d921d19171709acf3a50694294","title":"england world cup 2018 team guide tactics key players and expert predictions","story":"Gareth Southgate’s switch from 4-2-3-1 has given his young side flexibility, with Raheem Sterling central to England’s successThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Gareth Southgate committed to a three-man defence back in the autumn, tweaking the 4-2-3-1 system which had been successfully employed through a comfortable qualification campaign. The manager is now convinced a variation of 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 is the best way to eke performances and possession from a youthful group.At first glance it appeared a risky tactic given England are not blessed with top quality centre-halves. Yet the decision in March to employ Kyle Walker as the right sided central defender in the back-line, with Kieran Trippier coming in at wing-back, looks inspired. The Manchester City defender tucks in off the flank with his club, and injects pace and forward intent to the national team’s rearguard that will surely have the ball-playing John Stones at its heart, and the hugely promising Harry Maguire, Gary Cahill or Eric Dier on the left. It also allows England to exploit their principal assets: their wing-back options, whether Walker and Trippier on one side, or Danny Rose on the opposite flank.Dier could, of course, feature in defensive midfield and there may be times at the tournament when Southgate feels the need to employ two holding players to shield those at the back. Yet, when England need to be more progressive (against Panama and Tunisia in the group, for example), the 3-5-2 should see two forward thinking No 8s – plucked from Dele Alli, Jesse Lingard or Ruben Loftus-Cheek, for example – and either Dier or, more likely, Jordan Henderson as the central pivot.Given the lack of a natural playmaker, a No 10 who can create from the centre, packing midfield with energy and, in Loftus-Cheek’s case, a blend of skill and power seems a sensible alternative. “I think the system gives us good stability and it gives us easier solutions for our midfield players as well,” said Southgate. “Then there is a possibility to switch with what we play in front of it: maybe get two strikers in for certain games, or two midfielders off a forward, or three in midfield and two forwards.”He certainly has options. If Harry Kane leads the line, he can be supported either by the elusive Raheem Sterling, the promising Marcus Rashford, the party’s leading scorer Danny Welbeck, an out-and-out strike partner in Jamie Vardy, or a pair of attacking midfielders or wingers. Either way, Sterling already feels key to the system. The City player has just enjoyed his most productive club season yet, and brought that form to the England set-up in March. “That was good to see because, if we play 3-4-3, we know Raheem can play the No 10 role as he did against France last year,” said Southgate. “But could he play as one of two forwards when he usually plays on the wing for Manchester City?“We know he likes playing through the middle and his performance reminded me of that little spell at Liverpool where he was behind Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge, running and dribbling through the middle of the park,” Southgate continued. Sterling has yet to illuminate a major finals and so much depends upon whether he is confident and content when the campaign begins in Volgograd.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Ruben Loftus-Cheek goes to the tournament in the best form of his fledgling career. The Chelsea loanee is powerfully built, skilful in possession and deceptively quick across the turf. He thrived on international debut against Brazil in November and has long been championed by Southgate. Which player is likely to disappoint?Harry Kane will be convinced he can claim the tournament’s Golden Boot and, having struggled to make an impact at Euro 2016, will be anxious to make his mark. Yet the ankle injury he sustained in mid-March did blunt his form in Spurs’ jittery run-in. He has appeared rusty in the period since. Will he hit the ground running in Russia? What is the realistic aim for England at the World Cup and why?Passage into the quarter-finals is conceivable and the squad boasts the talent to achieve that goal. It would be welcome after the trauma of Brazil 2014, when England stumbled in their group and effectively exited the tournament six days into their campaign. Anything beyond the last eight is improbable, particularly given the calibre of opponent they would meet at that stage.Dominic Fifield writes for the . Follow him on Twitter here.

The goalkeeper showcased an extraordinarily varied passing range, crowned by the unerringly accurate, long range, side-foot volley which has become his hallmark, he invariably looked the best inidual on view.Impressed onlookers routinely agreed that Pickford possessed the sort of assured left foot leading coaches pay millions of pounds for. “It’s like watching a top midfielder,” said David Moyes, his manager at the time. “Jordan’s got a very big kick but he’s also got a very good passing range, he can go short, he can go long. Distribution is such a big part of goalkeeping these days and his is very good indeed.”Signed by Everton for £30m last summer, Pickford is also rather useful in central defence. Granted, with the ball at his feet, the 24-year-old often looks a natural-born midfield playmaker but he also seems adept as a classy sweeper.“I played Jordan at centre half in training so he understood what it was like for defenders when keepers came over the top of them for crosses,” recalled Kevin Ball, Sunderland’s former academy manager. “Jordan loved it. He could easily have been a centre half.“When he was in goal, the centre halves would split, hoping to take the ball from him but he’d just ping it upfield perfectly. I’d say ‘play it out Jordan, let them do it,’ but he’d reply ‘why? I’m better than them.’ He wasn’t being a pain, just honest. Jordan has confidence in his ability and his opinions. He’ll challenge you, he’ll say ‘I don’t agree’. I like that.”For his part, Pickford thrived under the exacting taskmaster. “Bally was a great coach who wouldn’t give us any leeway,” said Pickford. “We had to do all the old apprentice jobs, clean the dressing room, put Dubbin on the coaches’ boots.”Ball recognised that Pickford needed challenges and helped ensure that the boyhood Sunderland supporter from Washington, Tyne and Wear, received them.Loan stints at Darlington, Alfreton, Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston duly followed with their fans being treated to not only a series of stunning saves but early glimpses of that trademark rocket like sidefoot volley with which Pickford would later make so many goals for Jermain Defoe in Sunderland’s first team.“There’s no place to hide at places like Darlo and Alfreton,” reflected Pickford who was driven to the latter club’s home games by his parents and would sit in the back seat consuming the chicken and pasta lunches his mother had prepared in a tupperware box as they traversed the motorway network. “Playing for Darlington at 17 I learnt so much. You’re up against men, it’s a physical and mental test against big centre halves needing to pay their mortgages.”The stellar hand-eye co-ordination which would serve him so well was possibly inherited from his father, now a builder but once a gamekeeper on Lord Lambton’s County Durham estate.By the time he reached Preston, Pickford was a star in waiting. “I’ve never seen anyone kick a ball like Jordan can,” says Chris Kirkland, the former Liverpool goalkeeper who deputised for him at Deepdale. “I could never have kicked a ball as far as Jordan.“But the biggest thing about him was his command of the penalty area. All goalkeepers make saves but Jordan’s command of the area impressed me. He came out for crosses and high balls with an authority rare for one so young. He was brilliant.”Such fearlessness was evident as a small boy in Washington. Playing football with his older brother on the family’s asphalt drive the budding goalkeeper threw himself repeatedly onto that unforgiving surface as if it were a soft play area.A similarly unflinching candour, sets Pickford slightly apart from the crowd in today’s sometimes publicly synthetic football world. After Everton recently beat Newcastle United, Sunderland’s great rivals, he married a triumphant Instagram picture with the unapologetically undiplomatic message: “No better feeling than keeping them quiet.”If those north-east roots are the ties that bind the life of an England international who remains close to his family and lives with the girlfriend he has dated since they were 14, Pickford’s imposing amalgam of psychological and physical strength threatens to unnerve opponents in Russia. “Jordan has exceptional wrist and forearm strength,” says Adrian Tucker, Pickford’s goalkeeping coach at Sunderland. “He’s got excellent hands.” Not to mention exceptional feet and an exemplary mindset.For years England have been looking for a No 1 that can take them far in an international tournament. Finally, they may have found someone.

He left on loan to Rennes, where supporters quickly took him to their hearts, and this summer travels to Russia as a player on whom his country depends heavily. If he fulfils the hopes invested in him he may yet give Sunderland fans cause to smile: the club to whom he is still tied could make a tidy profit from selling him if he has a successful World Cup.In fairness to Sunderland fans, they did not chastise the forward because they thought he was a bad player. On the contrary, they wanted him to stay and booed him for expressing a desire to leave. But the reason Khazri wanted to leave was because he had hardly played the previous season under David Moyes in a Sunderland team that finished bottom of the Premier League.“He didn’t trust me,” Khazri told L’Equipe earlier this year. “I wasn’t in his plans but the fact that we finished with 24 points tells you about him. He just did not like my style of play. I’m not saying that I would have changed the club on my own but I could have helped the team.”Instead he helped Rennes. The Brittany team were second from bottom of Ligue 1 when he joined and had not won a match. In Khazri’s first appearance they triumphed 3-1 away to Marseille, Khazri topping an impressive performance with a backheeled goal. He continued that form all season to help Rennes achieve a remarkable fifth place finish. Remarkably, Khazri did that while playing out of position. Normally he operates on the wings but for Rennes he was asked to serve as a centre-forward. He did it so well that the club’s manager, Sabri Lamouchi, dubbed him ‘the Breton Cavani’.“We know that playing centre-forward is not something that can last in the long term, but he does it so well, getting free, looking for solutions by himself and standing out,” said Lamouchi. “He has intelligence and mischief. Every time he touches the ball, something happens.”Of course Khazri is not Breton. He was, in fact, born in Corsica and spent the first years of his career there, first at JS Ajaccio and then at Bastia. He represented France Under-17s and then, over the next few years, switched between playing for France and Tunisia at various youth levels. Eventually, in 2012, he pledged his international future to Tunisia, “the choice of my heart” and one that particularly pleased his football-loving father.In 36 senior appearances for the Carthage Eagles he has scored 12 goals, a good return for a player who has played primarily on the wings. He has also created many goals and not just from set-pieces, although his precise deliveries are a potent weapon.Already key, Khazri’s import to Tunisia increased when the team’s brightest star, Youssef Msanki, suffered a knee ligament injury in April that has forced him to sit out the World Cup. That – along with the injury to centre-forward Taha Yassine – helped to convince Tunisia manager Nabil Maâloul to emulate Rennes and use Khazri as a striker during the pre-World Cup warm-ups. Khazri responded by making the only goal of the game against Iran and scoring the winner against Costa Rica.Against Costa Rica, however, he also revealed his down side: a short fuse. After rugged tackle from the Costa Rica defender Kendall Waston, Khazri lashed out and was fortunate to be shown only a yellow card. He was not so lucky in 2016, when he reacted to a bad tackle against Mauritania by punching the perpetrator, leading to a straight red. “I think in a World Cup match he would have got a red card for kicking out at me like he did,” said Waston after the Costa Rica game. “In a friendly sometimes referees can leave it. People might look at that and think he could be wound up – and in football you have to take advantage of everything. When you know the type of player someone is, you try to do things that might make them crazy. England will see what happened and they will try to take advantage of it.” If Khazri does not fall into traps, he could be a real nuisance to opponents at the World Cup, a treasure to Tunisia and the bringer of a small windfall to Sunderland.

Carlos Queiroz, Team Melli’s manager, responded thus: “Players get used to their sports equipment, and it’s not right to change them a week before such important matches.” I would have thought players could still wear whatever boots they took with them or nip to the shops in Russia to buy a pair of Nike boots if they really, really want to wear them. Surely, it’s the perfect excuse to wear Puma King or Adidas Copa Mundial to win over a few neutrals. Anyway, I’m sure they won’t be playing barefoot when they face Morocco in their opener. Hello. Gregg here. While Simon’s digesting Zabivaka’s extraordinary backstory I’ll be keeping you company and pointing you towards other digestible items, one of which is our Tunisia player profile on Wahbi Khazri, a man who was last seen in Britain being booed out of Sunderland after failing to impress David Moyes but is now carrying the hopes of a nation as a makeshift striker after impressing in that position with Rennes. More, then, about Zabivaka, the World Cup mascot, and his extraordinary backstory. The more information it includes, the more startlingly bonkers it appears. ZABIVAKA™ is from Tyumen in Siberia, which is about 2500km east of Moscow. He is very proud of his Siberian heritage and has learned all about the history of his region at school. Tyumen was the first Russian settlement in Siberia, and his family can be traced all the way back to its earliest days. Being a wolf he is happy to play football in all conditions, but the ground can get a bit hard in January when the temperatures can drop as low as -50℃. Along with all of his friends at school, the environment has become a subject ZABIVAKA™ is very keen to talk about. Part of his job as the Official Mascot for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ will be to promote environmental projects happening in Russia. He may be a cheeky little wolf but he also cares deeply about the world. He can’t wait to raise awareness about his family’s habitat when travelling around Russia and throughout the world in the build up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup™. I’m going to hand over to Gregg Bakowski for a short while, to give me a few moments to digest these latest revelations. Back in a bit!The Swiss have landed!Here’s news of a former World Cup winner, Patrick Vieira, who has got himself a new job:Over to you, Didier!In the last few minutes Tunisia have arrived in Russia. There has been a desperate and disappointing lack of thumbs-aloft action today, but I remain eagle-eyed and optimistic.Our series of World Cup team guides continues with England:It’s been a while since we enjoyed some of the World Cup mascot’s dramatic backstory. So here’s more of the official, I-didn’t-make-it-up tale:ZABIVAKA™ is sociable and clicks with people easily, this is how he gathered a great collection of postcards from around the world: countless relatives and friends helped him with this. As the youngest in a family he is the most loved grandson. He helps his grandparents, who live close by, to clear the snow from their driveway in winter and to take care of their garden in the summer. When he was a little wolf, his mother read him many bedtime stories. ZABIVAKA™ is a big fan of stories by the famous Russian writer Pavel Bazhov*.* Pavel Bazhov was a Russian writer of fairy stories and a proud possessor of a magnificent beard, which in old age flowed in pure white from his chin towards his navel with reckless abandon, like Russian money to offshore bank accounts.New-somebody news! It’s perhaps a small step down from being a new Maradona, although we’ve had loads of those, but Nikola Milenkovic is currently being talked about as a new Nemanja Vidic, and for Serbian defenders praise hardly gets any higher. Here’s Reuters:Serbia defender Nikola Milenkovic knows he has a huge pair of boots to fill if he is to live up to expectations of emulating the accomplishments of compatriot Nemanja Vidic. Coach Mladen Krstajic said he saw “a new Vidic,” while fans and pundits also heaped praise on Milenkovic after a pair of rock-solid performances in Serbia’s warm-up games ahead of the World Cup in Russia.The centre back, who broke into Fiorentina’s first team in the second half of the Serie A season after his 2017 move from Partizan Belgrade, impressed in a 1-0 defeat by Chile followed by a 5-1 rout of Bolivia. “It is magnificent to be compared to the likes of Vidic and I have to stay humble with both feet firmly on the ground ,” Milenkovic told reporters at Belgrade airport prior to the team’s departure for Russia. “Vidic was one hell of a player while I am in the fledgling stage of my career and hence I have to keep working hard in order to climb that mountain. Krstajic’s praise means so much because it’s an impetus to keep improving.” The former Serbia and Manchester United captain Vidic made 56 international appearances, having won five Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League during his eight-year stint at Old Trafford. He retired in 2016 after an injury-plagued two-year spell at Inter Milan. Milenkovic, who displayed composure, tenacity and sound ball control in the two friendlies, is likely to be picked in the starting line up for Serbia’s opening Group E match against Costa Rica on Sunday.

This is all finely accompanied by various subtle movements of the eyebrows, forehead wrinkles and mouth. In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if Brazil had a thumbs-up interpreter travelling with the squad. Anyway, getting to the point, I’m sure your ‘Footballers-at-airports-giving the thums-up’ series will receive a massive boost when the Seleção touches down!”They have already touched down (see Neymar’s thumbs-sideways, below). Here, though, is a picture of an entire squad’s worth of fully numbered sun loungers at their training base, the Yug Sport Stadium.The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has suggested that the England team should wear black armbands during the World Cup in protest at the policies of the Vladimir Putin regime. This, it strikes me, is unlikely. Here’s what he told the Press Association:The World Cup is a massive propaganda coup for the Kremlin and it should never have gone there in the first place. We are using the beautiful game to launder the reputation of a dangerous authoritarian regime and that poses some major questions. We should think creatively about what we might be able to do to send a message. The FA pulling out would have been wrong because it would have made it look like a bilateral issue between Russia and the UK. But there are universal human rights norms, universal ways in which countries behave towards each other and Russia is in violation of those norms. Maybe we should seriously consider wearing a black armband in our first match, or in all our matches, to mark the death of Alexander Litvinenko, the attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter on British territory and the vicious injury to a member of our police force.It would need to be supported by the FA and they would probably be sanctioned by Fifa, who don’t like any symbolism, but at some point we’ve got to make a decision about the role and responsibility of football in the world. I suspect every single member of the English football team has more Twitter followers than any politician we have so they can send a really big political signal. They are role models to our young people and I do think this is an issue of our morals, our values and our ethics. It would great if they were able to say ‘We’re here in Russia now, but what’s happened on the streets of the United Kingdom raises concerns for all of us. An attack on one is an attack on all.’And here it is! The latest instalment in our occasional series Footballers in Airports Giving Thumbs-up Signs, starring Nemanja Matic.Serbia have landed!

With 355 caps and 120 goals scored in major tournaments between them, Cesc joins the previously announced World Cup winner Jurgen Klinsmann, twice African player of the year Didier Drogba and 2014 World Cup finalist Pablo Zabaleta.Philip Bernie, Head of TV Sport said: “We are delighted to welcome Cesc, as he joins our star-studded team of experts in Russia. As a World Cup winner, he knows what it takes to lift the biggest prize in the sport, and we are greatly looking forward to the world class football knowledge and insight he will add to our coverage.”Time, then, for the second instalment of the official, I-didn’t-make-this-up Zabivaka story!ZABIVAKA™ practices his skills everyday with his big brother - what he lacks in skill he makes up for in enthusiasm - and best friend from school.

None of them can keep up with him but they all love playing with him and supporting him.

The assassins waited, using the house opposite his as a base where they planned to gun him down. Witnesses heard 23 shots and police found the stolen red Nissan Versa they drove, an AK47 assault rifle, a 9mm revolver and more than a hundred rounds of ammunition. Henríquez, hit a dozen times, was rushed to hospital, where he died. A second man, Delano Wilson, was also killed. Josimar Gómez was wounded. It was 15 April 2017.Henríquez was 33, a father of three small children, and his only fear, he had said, was leaving them. He was also a professional footballer for Árabe Unido and the national team, which he represented 85 times. His penalty gave Panama the only title in their history – the 2009 Copa Naciones – and in his last interview, three weeks earlier, he expressed his hopes of reaching a first World Cup.Read more here:Here’s a good read from last week that you might have missed, about the only man to play in two World Cup finals for two different countries.Here’s the Croatia team, boarding a plane earlier today.

He’s not afraid to make difficult decisions. We saw a toughness in him. He was that close to getting the boot at Palace, right on the cusp when it came to turning pro. He had to fight to get where he is now. The reason they kept him on was he was so dedicated, so professional and always thinking. Want a comprehensive guide? Of course you do. How will Americans be watching this World Cup?Introducing our new World Cup columnist, Marcel Desailly. The following is taken verbatim from Version 6 (the latest iteration) of the official Zabivaka background story. I wasn’t aware that we needed to know how many siblings mascots have. I thought they were just supposed to look cute, to excite children and to sell merchandise. It seems I was wrong. Anyway, here goes!ZABIVAKA™ is the youngest in a big family of Siberian grey wolves. He lives with his 4 brothers, 5 sisters, mum, dad, aunts, uncles and cousins. All together there are 19 wolves in his pack. His dad is the leader of the pack and the reason why ZABIVAKA™ is so crazy about football. He used to play when he was a youngster, but hung up his boots many years ago now he’s just a huge fan of the local team, along with his own brothers and sisters and ZABIVAKA of course. It’s safe to say this is one football crazy wolf pack.

Here’s what the Press Association is telling us:Robbie Williams and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina will entertain the crowd at the opening ceremony of the World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium.They will be joined by Brazil’s two-time World Cup winner Ronaldo at Thursday’s show, which will be held just 30 minutes before the kick-off to the first match between Russia and Saudi Arabia. “I’m so happy and excited to be going back to Russia for such a unique performance,” Williams said. “I’ve done a lot in my career, and opening the FIFA World Cup to 80,000 football fans in the stadium and many millions all over the world is a boyhood dream.” The underlying theme of celebrating not only football but also the host country will be represented by a performance from Garifullina. “I never imagined I would be part of this huge celebration, the World Cup, happening in my own country,” the soloist from the Vienna State Opera said. “The image that I will be presenting to the whole world will be very symbolic and associated with a dream coming to life. “And, on 15 July, we will find out for whom this precious dream will come true, back on the same stage, after a month-long festival of football in Russia.” Ronaldo was part of the triumphant Brazil squad at the 1994 World Cup, albeit he did not feature, and then claimed the Golden Boot with eight goals as he led his nation to the trophy eight years later. The 41-year-old looks back fondly on past World Cup curtain-raisers and is relishing being involved at Russia 2018. “The opening match is always a very symbolic one - it is that instant when you realise that the big moment you, as a player or fan, have been waiting for for four years has finally arrived,” he said. “Of course it is also an emotional one for the hosts. After so much hard work, suddenly the whole world is gathered in your backyard to celebrate their love for football. “I felt that in Brazil four years ago and I am now happy to share this excitement with the Russians as well.” Here, as promised, is Grödig’s coat of arms. It appears to be a monkey vomiting blue lasers out of its mouth. So here we are. World Cup week. Things are really cranking into gear in Russia, and there will be (or have been already) press conferences from Spain, Russia, Portugal, Iceland, Australia, Panama, France, Croatia and Iran, as well as a variety of open-to-the-public training sessions and friendlies this evening between Belgium and Costa Rica, and Senegal and South Korea, the latter in the 4,128-capacity Untersberg-Arena in Grödig, Austria.

The tub sits there for just shy of two days – 46 hours later – until Friday morning, when they drain the chickpeas, now butter-yellow and fat, and toss just a little bicarbonate of soda through them. To finish, they funnel 500g portions into small, clear plastic bags, which are knotted and piled on the counter near the soaked salt cod, ready for customers who still observe, or simply like, the Roman habit of eating a meatless, chickpea-centred meal on Fridays.“Two days? That is bonkers,” said a friend when I told her I had discovered the secret of plump chickpeas on the far-side of Testaccio market. “Forget soaking: cover them with boiling water for an hour, drain, cover with cold water, bring to the boil and simmer them for two” was her surefire method. Another friend suggested a four-hour soak and a pressure cooker was the way to go, while my neighbour swore by an eight-hour soak followed by a three-hour simmer, with or without bicarbonate. Trusted books are equally opinionated and disparate, an arc of suggestions from no soaking needed, to a times table of chickpea timings, 2, 4, 8, 48, some categorical that you must change the soaking water before simmering (it is toxic) and others very clear that you mustn’t (it is nectar).Of course, the answer to all this is to stop asking for advice and to figure out a method of my own. And for years I did have one. It may not have been surefire, but it was pretty sure: an overnight soak and then a juddering simmer until done. Then I cooked a few not-so-happy batches, as did a few readers – more than any other ingredient, I have had emails and notes about the curse of the still-hard chickpea. So I decided I would do a Felicity Cloake and test all the various ways, to come up with the perfect one. The thing is, this many possible combinations to test meant cooking more chickpeas than even we could eat, and my experiment quickly unravelled. My default position is to trust in Lina, with a degree of variation: a 24-48 hour soak, a light bicarbonate rub-through and simmering until the chickpeas are soft enough to squish into an almost-hummus between your fingertips (which isn’t very long if you have soaked Lina style).Soaking and cooking gives you that cloudy, slightly viscous cooking liquid, which provides a gently flavoured broth for soups, stews, or today’s dish of chickpeas and spinach, an Armenian dish called nivik from Tess Mallos’s 1979 Complete Middle Eastern Cookbook (in which, by the way, she suggests an overnight soak followed by a two-hour simmer in the soaking water). I knew this recipe would be a favourite the moment I read it (helped, no doubt, by Reg Morrison’s wonderful Technicolor photo). Tess suggests eating this with bread and pickles, and I do, although it is just as good with rice or a grilled lamb chop.Tender chickpeas are crucial for this dish: they need to succumb willingly to the back of a fork, not ping across the room, so I’d suggest cooking them according to Lina’s method (make a double batch). If you’d rather stick to your own method, please leave commentsadvice: I agree with Laurie Colwin in believing that, next to eating and cooking, talking and writing about eating and cooking are two of life’s delights. One home cook giving another advice really does make the cooking world go round.300g dried chickpeas1 pinch bicarbonate of soda750g spinach1 large onion, peeled and diced8 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp tomato paste or 100ml passataSalt and black pepperSugar, to tasteCover the chickpeas with cold water and leave to sit for 24-48 hours (which is why it is worth soaking a double quantity and keeping half for another dish). Drain and cover the chickpeas with at least 5cm clean water, and an optional small pinch of bicarbonate of soda, bring to a boil, skimming with a slotted spoon until the water is clear, then simmer for one to two, until the chickpeas are very tender. Leave to cool in the cooking liquid. Wash the spinach, discard any tough stems or discoloured leaves, and chop roughly.In a saucepan with a lid, fry the onion gently in the olive oil until translucent and soft. Add the tomato, a pinch of salt, a grind of black pepper and a tablespoon of sugar. Stir, then add the drained chickpeas – retain the cooking liquid.Add the spinach and a little of the chickpea cooking liquid to the frying pan, stir, cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted. Uncover and cook for another 5-10 minutes, adjusting the seasoning to taste. The final dish should be moist, but not wet, so add a little more chickpea cooking water if needed. Serve hot, warm, or cold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c5434024b948c622f04fc544e0e98dac29faef3/0_211_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3af5a88e63f1787a345e6ef3a2670be4","title":"tesco sells green lemons as spanish supply sours","story":"Supermarket says South African lemons are mature but need longer to turn yellowTesco has started selling green lemons after relaxing its quality specifications in an attempt to avoid shortages in its UK stores and reduce food waste.Although the skins are slightly green, the fruit is as zesty and robust as lemons that have turned completely yellow, while the flesh inside is ripe and edible.The UK’s largest retailer has lifted its colour requirements for lemons partly to help offset domestic food waste by adding up to an extra two days’ shelf life to the fruit as it ripens.There has also been a shortage of yellow lemons caused by poor growing conditions in Spain, which supplies the UK with the bulk of the fruit until the end of spring.South Africa’s lemon season traditionally begins in late June and it takes over as the UK’s main supplier. However, Tesco will take the greener South African lemons earlier than usual to avoid gaps in its supply.“These greener lemons that we now have on sale are already mature and perfect tasting inside but need longer for the skin to turn yellow,” said Tesco’s citrus fruit buyer Savia Weidinger-Reich. “With the South African crop, that happens towards the end of June as evenings cool, which helps the fruit to colour. The move not only means that shoppers will again be easily able to buy a fruit that is growing in popularity, but they will gain extra freshness.”The greener lemons – the same price as regular yellow ones – are unlikely to be confused with limes as they have the more distinctive, elongated shape of lemons. Last year, Tesco started selling green satsumas and clementines to reduce food waste.The retailer says it is committed to reducing food waste throughout its supply chain and works with farmers and suppliers to adjust crop specifications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade4419ee3c19292d3990f74a4a645efca3337ed/0_11_999_599/master/999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b9331b34036033fcd4091e1dd7eef","title":"beyond poppies six things you didnt know about the royal british legion","story":"From supporting veterans in emergency situations to providing breaks for service families, Legion initiatives offer a vital helping hand to serving and former members of the armed forcesBeing a member of the armed forces can be high risk and many personnel leave with life-changing injuries. The Royal British Legion provides high quality recovery and rehabilitation support to ex-service personnel who find themselves wounded, injured, sick, or who are experiencing multiple challenges such as being out of work, dealing with mental health problems, financial issues and alcohol abuse.The programme’s flagship is the £27m Battle Back Centre at Lilleshall in the West Midlands, which provides sports and adventure activities designed to promote self-confidence and improve motivation to aid recovery. Tailored programmes help the wounded cope with both physical and psychological challenges.For most, leaving the armed forces means starting a completely new career. The Legion offers a wide range of services designed to help ex-service men and women find employment including Civvy Street – a dedicated website, which lists job vacancies and provides online training resources and information on changing careers. The Legion can also provide funding for additional training or education through its employment support grant scheme.Anyone planning on starting a business will also be supported in their ambition. The Legion provides guidance on business plans, finances and tax requirements. Specialist assistance is also available to put together a business plan, source funding and even find mentors.Not everyone is a DIY whiz and not all former members of the services are equipped to tackle repair jobs. However, rather than booking a handyman, The Royal British Legion provides a handy van service across 21 counties to help with minor home adaptations and repairs for older or less able veterans and their families. The fully trained team assists with maintenance round the home – covering everything from putting up shelves and grab rails to building access ramps and storage sheds to provide shelter for personal mobility vehicles.They can also install the Legion’s system of care phones. A type of personal alarm, a care phone is a telephone-based unit worn on a user’s wrist or neck that can be used to summon help in an emergency.It can be tough and stressful for families and children of those serving in the armed forces. Often some light relief can make a real difference, but taking a much-needed holiday can prove difficult for those on a tight budget. The Legion provides a range of welfare services including week-long adventure breaks for children. These breaks offer a great opportunity for youngsters to have fun, make new friends, have new experiences and improve their self-esteem while giving parents a well-earned break.Parents are not left out either. Week-long breaks for service families are offered at four Legion centres in traditional British seaside resorts during the Easter, summer and October school holidays. Guests are free to take in the sea air while exploring the coast or visiting local tourist attractions. The breaks offer rest and recuperation for people recovering from life-changing events such as illness or bereavement.In the UK today, one in six people over 80 has dementia and by 2025 more than a million people could have the condition. Inevitably, former members of the services feature in these figures. The Royal British Legion provides care in the shape of its purpose built dementia wings at four of its six residential care homes in Somerset, Warwickshire, Norfolk and north Yorkshire, as well as specialist, admiral nurses – developed in partnership with Dementia UK – who work in the community. Currently operating in Lancashire, the west Midlands, Hampshire and Somerset, admiral nurses offer specialist support, information and advice to the family carers of people living with dementia within the armed forces community.Leaving the armed forces means having to deal with an array of financial issues that can be confusing if you’re not prepared for them. Bring in The Royal British Legion’s team of benefits and money advisers. This financial team provides support and guidance in the event ex-service people and their families suffer money problems or need guidance to help set up a new home or access benefits. It also provides help with debt and other unexpected crises, plus support through grants.The Legion has set up MoneyForce, a dedicated website designed to improve understanding of financial issues with information on essentials such as interest charges or buying a home. Managed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Standard Life Charitable Trust, the scheme has saved beneficiaries £70m through increases in benefits, tax credits, writing off debts and gaining grants since it began in 2007. It gives ex-service men and women the skills they need to manage their money, smoothing the transition to civilian life.To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ff3067600800f04a2da10647e54e5e32ec7e10/0_2072_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0aec84bb2060bf6c59fc36a7dfec07","title":"jeremy vine to take over wright stuff slot on channel 5","story":"Show to relaunch in autumn, with Matthew Wright doing his final programme this weekThe Wright Stuff is to be renamed after it was announced that the BBC Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine will be taking over as host of the long-running Channel 5 chatshow in the autumn.Matthew Wright quit as the host of his eponymous morning programme this year after 18 years.

Fair Vote has asked a judge to permanently bar the firms from destroying any data that they might be holding in Mississippi. At the heart of the complaint is an allegation that the companies may have used data that had been mined in the UK and combined it with information that had been collected from Eldon Insurance, which sells car insurance in the UK. The suit further alleges that the data may have been brought to the University of Mississippi, where the companies sought to create their own version of Cambridge Analytica, the controversial firm that used data mined from social media networks to try to sway voters’ behaviour. Fair Vote and the lead plaintiff in the case, a British resident called Kyle Taylor, have said in court filings that they want to determine whether any UK data was illegally transferred to Mississippi as part of the groups’ plans.It is also seeking answers about whether data was illegally used to target political advertising to UK voters before the referendum to leave the EU on 23 June 2016.The case was filed after evidence heard before a parliamentary committee raised questions about Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins’involvement with the University of Mississippi. She added: “This company has reportedly worked with a data science team at the University of Mississippi. If the Mississippi team has held or processed UK citizens’ data in the US, I believe that is likely to be a criminal offence although it is for the empowered authorities to pursue any such question and secure the associated evidence.”The allegations have been denied by Banks, who said that his first contact with officials at the University of Mississippi occurred months after the Brexit vote.“We are slightly bemused,” Banks told the . “I think where it has come from was what Brittany Kaiser said before the committee, but actually she was just talking rubbish.” He later added that he believed Kaiser was “just speculating” about his companies’ activities in Mississippi.“The only thing we have is an empty office that was due to be refurbished. We have no staff there,” Banks said. He added that his company Eldon Insurance had “strong data controls” and that it was “just not true” that data had been used in connection to the 2016 referendum.Banks’s companies have asked for the complaint to be dismissed.Josh Gladden, the University of Mississippi’s vice-chancellor for research, testified that Big Data Dolphins has no access to university computer servers and had not stored anything at the university.He said university researchers never agreed specific projects with Eldon and had not been asked to destroy evidence. “The result of this investigation is, to our satisfaction, that there’s been no data transfer between any of the companies and the University of Mississippi,” Gladden said.Victoria Sena, who manages the Big Data Dolphins project, testified that she never discussed server access. “I haven’t transferred data,” Sena said. “I don’t have access to data. There is no way to access it. There is no one to transfer it to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f322318e043c789b3e2bdf4a326e496957a2fe59/0_122_3904_2342/master/3904.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddd83054246d8abc7a87203a33ddb37d","title":"catastrophic no deal brexit a real possibility says vince cable","story":"Lib Dem leader urges Theresa May to stand up to hardline Brexiters in her own party A “potentially catastrophic” no-deal Brexit is becoming ever more possible, Vince Cable has warned, saying that if this happened it would be an unprecedented policy disaster.As the Liberal Democrats prepare to fight the Lewisham East byelection on Thursday on a platform of guaranteeing a referendum on any eventual deal, the party leader said the longer the government appeared deadlocked over Brexit, the greater the risk the UK would leave the EU without a deal.“I’d always assumed that the government would more or less get something, a orce settlement plus a vague commitment to sort things out – Brexit in name but probably not in fact,” Cable told the  during a visit to the constituency.“But as time passes and they can’t reconcile their internal differences, you begin to think that not getting any kind of deal at all is back on the agenda. We’d rather discounted it, but it’s a real possibility again.”Cable, who was among those who sent out warnings before the 2008 financial crash, said leaving the EU without a deal would be “potentially catastrophic”. Asked if he could think of a policy disaster of similar magnitude he said: “Not really. There have been disastrous errors on policy – Iraq, Suez – but nothing like this.” He urged Theresa May to stand up to hardline Brexiters, such as the European Research Group of Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.“I can’t understand why she won’t take on the hard right of the party. The chances of them actually dislodging her are not high,” he said. “You’d have thought she’d say, we’ve reached the limit of what we can do, and I’m going to go ahead in the customs unionsingle market framework, and you guys will have to put up with it. And she would have the support of the rest of parliament and would carry the country.”Cable has had mixed success as the Lib Dem leader since regaining his Twickenham seat at the 2017 election, but the party was buoyed by better-than-anticipated results in May’s local elections. It is hoping for another boost from the Lewisham East vote, which was prompted by Heidi Alexander’s decision to resign from the safe Labour seat for a role with London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan.“We’re looking for a substantial improvement in our vote share – we’d certainly expect to overtake the Tories,” he said, sitting alongside the party’s candidate, the charity consultant Lucy Salek, in a cafe in the south-east London constituency.“There is a very, very outside possibility of winning, but given the size of the margin it will be difficult to do that.”Salek argued that with Labour complacent and the Conservatives largely absent there was scope for the Lib Dems to profit from concerns about Brexit in the heavily pro-remain constituency, where the issue has been mentioned “over and over again” on doorsteps.Cable said the party’s policy of calling for a public vote on a final Brexit deal was proving popular.“Brexit wasn’t very clearly defined at the time, in what it entailed,” he said. “That’s all the more reason for having a vote on the outcome, and that’s beginning to have a certain amount of resonance with voters.”One notable element of the byelection is the decision of the Labour candidate, Janet Daby, to support continued UK membership of the single market and customs union, contrary to party policy.While the Lib Dems question whether Daby has reined in her stance on Brexit under pressure from her party hierarchy, Cable said Labour isions before key votes on the EU withdrawal bill this week pointed to tensions reminiscent of the era when the Social Democratic party split away from Labour.Asked whether another centrist party could emerge, he said: “It could happen. Obviously, the SDP history, at least as it’s retold, is given as a warning about not repeating history. But I think some Labour MPs are being put in an impossible situation. We’ll see that when the votes come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf5dc1992e690211d383c7422fa5e2bf13db24a2/0_216_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=500\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=eb0f1c3bca7eb04f87dd69b1b726cd68 1000w","title":"rees mogg no need for customs checks at dover in no deal brexit","story":"Legal experts dismiss Tory MP’s vision, saying it would breach WTO rulesJacob Rees-Mogg has said that there would be no need for customs checks at Dover on EU imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, suggesting that any delays for exports to Europe would be France’s responsibility.The leading Conservative party Brexiter said checks would not be needed because EU goods could be trusted.However, his vision was immediately dismissed by legal experts as a breach of World Trade Organization rules because it would amount to discriminatory practice.In a phone-in on London radio station LBC he told a concerned caller from the Kent town that he had no need to worry.“The delays will not be at Dover, they will be at Calais,” Rees-Mogg told him, claiming that the French would have to conducts checks under EU law, but the UK would not as it would have taken back control of its borders. Nathaniel, who did not give his surname, called to ask Rees-Mogg when the government was going to “take seriously” the problems local people would face with congestion if there is no deal. He said locals had already dubbed the government’s plans “Operation Stack on steroids”, a reference to the existing scheme which is put in place in the event of disruption.Rees-Mogg, who is head of the European Research Group of MPs, told him: “There will be no need to have any delays on goods coming in from the continent in the event we leave with no deal, because goods that are safe on 29 March will be safe on 30 March and that means inbound traffic ought not to suffer any delays because it will be our choice.”He also claimed that if the French insisted on checks, lorries could ert to other ports in Europe.“If we leave without a deal and the French say your goods can’t come in via Calais, which is possible, but then there are other ports and Rotterdam and Antwerp have been increasing their infrastructure and taking on more customs officers,” he said.His vision was dismissed as confused by the British Ports Association. “It is difficult to see a situation where food and other products could be legally imported from another customs territory without being subject to some kind of border check. We understand that government may choose to waive these in event of no deal but we are not sure of the basis of that decision. Presumably that would be an emergency option and it is certainly not a comfortable fallback position in the medium or long term,” said Richard Ballantyne, the BPA’s chief executive.Legal experts also questioned Rees-Mogg’s claims and said they could break WTO rules.“The basic idea that we will check non-EU goods but not check EU if there is no trade deal done with the EU or a customs union agreement will violate the basic rules of the WTO, because that would be deemed discriminatory,” said Steve Peers, professor or law at the University of Essex and EU law expert. Quite apart from the “narrow” issue of customs checks, there would also be an issue for suppliers such as car manufacturers because some “parts go back and forth across the channel several times”, Peers added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9d99470b3944c973303f3f3d03980ac4245c987/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04f50e22cb0c6a99e682a68d11388811","title":"brexit jacob rees mogg hosts lbc phone in politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenLabour’s Ben Bradshaw asks how May reponded when Trump said Russia should be let back in.

She says Russia was kicked out of the G8 after the annexation of Crimea. She says she has opposed letting it back in until it changes its attitude.Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, asks what is the point of the G7. The most powerful member does not believe in a rules-based system. And India and China are not involved. Shouldn’t it be closed down?May says Cable should look at the conference communique.Sir Michael Fallon, the Conservative former defence secretary, asks how the rapid response mechanism set up at the G7 to respond to Russian aggression will work.May says there will be faster attribution when Russia does something. And then the G7 countries will work together to retaliate.Labour’s Hilary Benn says, under May’s Brexit backstop plan, the UK will remain in a customs union with the EU until the end of 2021 or longer.May says the point of the backstop is that it is there in case new trade rules are not in place. She says she wants new arrangements to be in place by the end of 2020. She hopes the backstop won’t be used.Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, says despite the difficulties at the summit, it did show the importance of multinational organisations. He says it also showed why her cabinet colleagues are wrong to depend on Trump to offer a good trade deal with the UK after Brexit.May says the UK has been speaking to the US about such a trade deal. The government believes open markets are the best way to bring jobs, she says. She wants to do trade deals in the interests of the UK.Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, says the G7 summit shows President Trump has little time for multilateral summits. Doesn’t May reflect on how it went, and realise how important it is to keep as much of the benefits of the EU single market as possible. We will need it in the future, he says.May is responding to Corbyn.She says some of the issues he raised did not come up at the summit.On relations with the US, she says the US did support the UK after the Salisbury nerve agent attack.What is important is that the two countries can talk about these issues, she says.She says she has been very clear to Trump that she thinks the steel and aluminium tariffs are unjustified.But it is important not to have continuous tit-for-tat retaliation, she says. That is why it is important to keep talking, she says.She says Labour’s policy would hand over negotiation of trade deals to the EU.Jeremy Corbyn says the summit was a failure. President Trump was to blame, he says.The problem is that is is pursusing a policy of America first.He says attempts to engage with the US have failed. He says the UK should never outsource policy to the US.He asks May to condemn the Trump adviser who said Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, deserved a special place in hell. He expresses concern that Jaguar Land Rover is moving production of the Discovery to Slovakia.He asks if the summit discussed the migrants on the ship Aquarius. He praises Spain for taking them in.May says she expressed deep disappointment at the US’s decision to impose steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU.She says the tariffs were unjustified. They will make everyone poorer, she says.She says the EU will retaliate.Theresa May is making her Commons statement on the G7 summit.There was strong discussion and disagreement on some issue, she says.She says that, as a result of discussion between the leaders and their teams, there were able to agree on a communique.She praises Justin Trudeau, the summit chair, of his leadership.And she says the UK intends to honour the commitments it made.Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s former communications chief, thinks Theresa May looks “stronger” and “more human” after using her Evening Standard article (see 11.55am) to say she was wrong not to meet survivors when she first visited Grenfell Tower after the fire.And this is from a law professor.On Friday, at his press conference in Brussels, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, raised various problems with the UK’s Brexit backstop plan, although afterwards he posted a message insisting that he was not rejecting it out of hand.Today the commission has published a slideshow presentation (pdf) highlighting objections to the UK plan. It repeats the points made by Barnier on Friday, but also goes further. Technically it might not amount to an absolute rejection, but it is almost as good as.Here is the final slide with the commission’s conclusion.The commission says the UK plan, as published, would still require a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.It is worth stressing “as published” because the document published by the government on Friday said explicitly that it was just a proposal “for the customs element of the backstop”. But a backstop would have to cover regulatory alignment too. According to reports, one idea is for the final element of the backstop plan to involve Northern Ireland staying in regulatory alignment with the single market, but not the rest of the UK.The European commission has also published an infographic (pdf) explaining why its own backstop plan would solve the border problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0b1b67a865464cd7cd4bf00ef876da719b25b6/0_87_2094_1256/master/2094.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4cdaa288a0a5b57a83c351804308841","title":"when size does matter big beasts last of the giants in pictures","story":"Patrick Aryee’s gets up close and personal with some of the world’s biggest creatures in his new three-part series.

But the climate is changing. In recent weeks, the US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a conservative Republican who opposes marijuana legalization, has called for hemp to be legalized, a move which would benefit farmers, though McConnell still opposes marijuana legalization. And it’s not just the farmers in McConnell’s home state of Kentucky who would be pleased to see a resurgence of the crop. Early this month for hemp history week, the US Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution acknowledging hemp’s economic value and “historical relevance”.China, though wary of marijuana, has emerged as a hemp “superpower”, according to a fascinating 2017 story in the South China Morning Post. While hemp is indigenous to China, Chinese research advanced only recently in 1970 when the military used it for uniforms that would be more comfortable in the Vietnamese jungle. Today, the Morning Post notes, China holds more than half of the world’s more than 600 hemp-related patents. Hemp’s revival is only the latest chapter in a long history.In China, hemp has been used to make fabric and rope for more than 3,000 years. A Chinese eunuch named Cai Lun, who is credited with inventing paper during the early Christian era, used hemp as one of his source materials. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, hemp rope, sails and rigging were so vital to the British Royal Navy that the supply was considered a national security issue. Both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I encouraged growing the crop. In the US, some of the founding fathers grew hemp. Stoner lore has it that the constitution and declaration of independence were written on hemp. It’s not true – they were written on parchment – but drafts of the documents probably were. But interest in hemp waned as cotton, a finer fabric dependent on American slave labor, ascended. It was last a relevant crop in the US during the second world war, when the Department of Agriculture made a Hemp for Victory film and encouraged production. Today’s hemp advocates, a passionate cohort indeed, claim paper, cloth and biofuel made from hemp are all environmentally and economically attractive, relative to the prevailing current methods. If hemp became a major source for any one of these staples, it would be an immense opportunity, akin to legal marijuana.And there are more uses for hemp still. The seeds are a good source of protein, popular with vegans. Hemp can also be made into a building material known as hempcrete, which is currently easier to access in parts of Europe than in the US. A bridge in sixth-century Gaul was built from hempcrete. Bryan DeHaven’s Colorado-based clothing company, Chiefton Supply Co, makes T-shirts from a hempcotton blend. The component organic hemp is grown, processed into fabric and then stitched into apparel all at one facility in China’s Shangdong province.DeHaven said hemp’s benefits included that it needed substantially less water than cotton to grow. The resultant cloth, he said, also had anti-bacterial properties Chiefton is working with sportswear companies on breathable hemp clothing for athletes. “Those guys are really putting our garments to the test,” he said. Eventually, DeHaven said, he would like to see Chiefton hemp goods produced in the US “from seed to seam”. It will be difficult. Hemp is not completely illegal in the US but the current rules are wildly convoluted, probably even more so than those for marijuana. But the laws weren’t the main problem, DeHaven said. You can’t make hemp clothing in the US because the country no longer has sufficient expertise in textile production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08684a4f29d12810147543633c089751f2b6924e/483_152_1588_953/master/1588.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f531c965d9a5742a31d9a9058d95cd3d","title":"joel tomkins resigns wigan joins hull kr super league","story":"• Forward signs deal with Hull KR until end of next season• Tomkins: ‘I decided the best thing would be for me to leave’Joel Tomkins’ Wigan career is over after the forward agreed to cut ties with his hometown club and join Hull KR less than a week after being suspended following an “embarrassing” off-field incident.The 31-year-old has signed a deal until the end of next season after Wigan accepted the player’s resignation following footage that emerged earlier this month of him and younger brother Sam being abusive towards staff in a bar in the town.

The Exeter front row supplied back up to Jamie George in the series opener and if he is ruled out, Singleton will be promoted straight on to the bench. “Luke has a tight hamstring so Jack Singleton is coming as a precaution,” defence coach Paul Gustard said. “We’ve only got two hookers in camp so we have to be careful and have someone else coming over. Luke hasn’t been ruled out of Saturday yet.” England were unable to provide a definitive update on Joe Launchbury, who sat out the firsts Test because of a calf injury.

Oliver then summarized tactics used by Trump’s supporters to delegitimize the investigation, like redefining the terms of the inquiry itself. “It is important to remember Mueller wasn’t tasked with finding proof of collusion. In actuality he was tasked with looking into links and coordination between the Russian government and anyone associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matter that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,” said Oliver. “That’s a pretty broad mandate. So saying the investigation has to shut down if there’s no collusion is like saying a game of Scrabble has to end because you fit all the letters in your mouth. “There’s also whataboutism,” Oliver added, “the practice of shifting the debate to someone else’s wrongdoing.”Oliver proceeded to share a clip from Sean Hannity’s show, in which the Fox News host wondered why people like Christopher Steele, the Clintons, Jim Comey and Susan Rice weren’t being prosecuted instead of Trump.“That is a lot of name to throw up on the screen and just say, what about them?” Oliver quipped. “Hannity’s point is that other people did bad things so therefore Trump’s bad things don’t count. Let me be clear on this: whether or not someone else did something shitty has no bearing over whether you did something shitty. If that were true, every movie that got a bad review could simply say, what about From Justin to Kelly?”Finally, Oliver explained how successfully the right has established its own counter-narrative to the special counsel’s inquiry “by framing it as part of a grand conspiracy to bring down Trump”.“Night after night, Hannity paints a picture where the investigation itself is one gigantic scandal, with the Democrats, the FBI, the Deep State, and the establishment Republicans teaming up to bring down Trump,” the host added, noting that Hannity is fond of saying that “Spygate” makes “Watergate look like stealing a Snickers bar”.“None of this even addresses the most obvious question,” Oliver said. “If absolutely everyone from Hillary to the FBI to Trey Gowdy was in on a Deep State plan to sabotage Trump, how the fuck is he president right now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a588749fee4149b1004f3bede5d8014f95ccb3b/0_45_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38017a9159fc8e726b272661326e761f","title":"gay asylum seeker faces deportation from uk to nigeria adeniyi raji","story":"Adeniyi Raji’s case just one of rising number from countries outlawing homosexualityA Nigerian asylum seeker who fled to Britain to avoid prosecution for being gay is facing deportation after being held for six months in an immigration detention centre.The threat hanging over Adeniyi Raji, 43, who received death threats on social media, highlights the increasing number of claims to the Home Office by iniduals from countries where homosexuality is outlawed. In Nigeria, homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also outlawed. After Pakistan and Bangladesh, it is the country that produces the largest number of asylum claims based on sexual orientation.Raji fled the city of Lagos and arrived at Heathrow airport in November. He claimed asylum and was immediately detained, being held at Harmondsworth and Tinsley House detention centres. He was recently given bail and released from detention. Threats against him on on social media in Nigeria included comments such as: “I really wish you were killed that very day …”, “You know gay practice is an abomination in our land …”, and “You better stop your gay practice, if not you could get yourself killed in this country”. A first-tier immigration tribunal has rejected his asylum application. He is appealing against that decision. Bisi Alimi, a Nigerian-born British citizen who runs a UK-based campaign supporting LGBT rights in his home country, criticised the Home Office’s treatment of gay asylum seekers. “They are often treated as liars.

The Home Office doesn’t believe in the impact of threats from non-state actors.

Within a few hours, dozens of residents in Boulard’s 17th arrondissement in north-west Paris had reported numerous sightings, dead and alive.The local mairie, or town hall, has also opened a rat “hotline” for those who do not have access to the internet. There is also a poster campaign in local parks and on municipal notice boards reminding people not to throw litter on the ground and to clean up after their picnics.Boulard said he hoped the campaign would put pressure on City Hall to act.“If it’s a priority for them then they should be working harder. As soon as a local resident or passer-by makes a report we will go back to City Hall and the interactive map will be updated each time they intervene. A small shovel will replace the drawing of the rat (on the map). That’s if they intervene.”He added: “I don’t wish to remain passive about this.”A pair of rats can produce up to 32 offspring a year, which in turn can produce a colony of more than 900 animals in the space of a year, given enough food and the right conditions.While City Hall organises regular eradication operations, Stéphane Bras, a pest control expert, said it was not enough. He said members of the public, shops and private companies all had to do their bit.“Buildings aren’t hermetic. If one is treated the rats move to another. The mairie has campaigns but these are necessarily supported by other private organisations,” Bras said.Bras added that there were not necessarily more rats in Paris than in other cities, but that they were more visible.“When they’re in the sewers they’re useful. When they come up to our level, they can do damage ... and in terms of image, for a city like Paris, or New York, to see rats running in the streets has an effect on the population and tourists that is disastrous,” he told Le Parisien."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06771431813a6b6dc7ed2e725b18cf39ea3a9fc9/0_31_3128_1876/master/3128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d30841f77221fa3fb22d661d9627458b","title":"g7 summit a weekend of international diplomacy in pictures","story":"The summit took place in La Malbaie, in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Canada, at the weekend, where leaders struggled to heal a tariff dispute that has pushed them to the brink of a trade war.

File photograph: iStock The second of this year’s higher-level maths papers was very demanding, with some especially tough parts and a nasty surprise, according to teachers.“It was easily the trickier of the two exams,” said Eamonn Toland, founder of TheMathsTutor.ie.“The concepts and skills section had some deceptively tricky questions. For example, the question on the empirical rule had a twist that might have stumped some students, although it could be solved without using the empirical rule.”Mr Toland added: “The two geometry questions were fairly doable but the statistics question was quite difficult. “The students had to be very good at interpreting abstract mathematical results and some of the parts were quite different from previous statistics questions. This is a part of the course that many students find difficult so parts of this question might have stumped quite a few of them.”Luke Saunders, Studyclix.ie founder and a maths teacher at Jesus and Mary Secondary School in Enniscrone, Co Sligo, said that students sitting higher-level maths paper two would have found section A relatively straightforward but that there was a sting in the tail in section B. “Question 8 combined questions on statistics with probability and may have thrown some weaker students,” he said.Mr Saunders was surprised to see a question on sequences and series appear on the paper given that they had been a particularly dominant topic on paper one. Aidan Roantree, senior maths teacher at the Institute of Education in Dublin, said it was a very demanding paper and that to move beyond a H4 or H5, students would have required a very good understanding of the material. “The headline surprise is the inclusion of a question on financial maths on paper two, which normally appears exclusively on paper one,” he said.“The most difficult of the geometry proofs was asked and the B part of question 8 was a completely new in-depth analysis of the margin of error approximation, which was very tough.” However, he said the questions on geometry and trigonometry were generally “very fair”.With regards to the ordinary-level paper, Mr Toland said that section A was easy but section B contained some tricky statistics. The number of atoms in a solid gold sphere was among the topics featured. “The concepts and skills question was fairly straightforward and many of the parts were extremely easy,” he said. “For example, to complete a table that shows the possible values for the sum of two dice the student only needs to be able to add two numbers together. The concepts and applications section had quite a lot of statistics, which is normally a topic reserved for higher level. “Even though the question is fairly straightforward, many students at ordinary-level may not be familiar with the phrase ‘confidence interval’.”Mr Saunders said that students who were comfortable with applying trigonometry and geometry skills would have been happy with today’s paper and that it was typical of what is expected from Project Maths.Q8(c) Acme Confectionary has an employee pension plan.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt has been as glorious a start to the summer as most of us can remember and the good weather is set to continue for the next few days at least.However, Met Éireann is warning the “exceptional weather” will come to an end later this week.Dublin recorded one of its sunniest weeks on record last week with some 80 hours of sunshine, the equivalent of more than 11 hours a day.Monday will be mild and dry in most places with a respectable 21 degrees in the midlands and east. This is cooler than of late and the sunshine will be more hazy, but still above normal for the time of year.Tuesday will be a similar kind of day and both days will be dry across the country.A notable change is due on Wednesday. The bad news is that rain is forecast across the country for the first time in weeks: the good news is that this will be most welcome by farmers and Irish Water.The rain will appear off the west coast on Wednesday afternoon and gradually extend across the country reaching eastern areas by nighttime.Near drought-like conditions have been experienced across the country for the past three weeks. Dublin has had just 1mm of rain since June 1st and May was exceptionally dry with just a third of the average rainfall recorded for the month.Most places had just trace amounts of rainfall in recent weeks. Even those places that had more normal levels of rainfall in the north and midlands only did so because of heavy thunderstorms last week.There has been several gorse fires over the last few weeks in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains and the dry conditions have caused water shortages in the Skerries area of Dublin.The Department of Agriculture has issued an orange “high risk” forest fire warning that remains in place until Wednesday, June 13th.They have asked public if they see a fire to not delay in reporting a fire to the fire and emergency services.But rain is on the way.“The exceptional weather is coming to an end but we’re not going down the tubes either,” Met Éireann forecaster John Eagleton said.He explained the change in wind direction from south to west will mean a transition to cooler, more showery weather. Nevertheless, the temperatures will still be in the high teens and rainfall amounts will not be above normal.“We’re not going to get lashings of it,” he explained. “It won’t be as sunny as it was, but it will still be very pleasant.”Thursday and Friday will be mostly dry days with temperatures of 16 to 18 degrees - cooler because of the change in wind direction.Mr Eagleton said rainfall amounts over the next 10 days will range from 15mm in the east and midlands to 60mm in the north-west.Some rain is forecast next weekend as there will be more unsettled conditions and southwesterly winds. Monday next week looks like bringing a lot of rain across the country."},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

It\u0027s hard if you\u0027re being painted in the press as a liar and now she\u0027s able to say: ‘I know it\u0027s a bizarre story but it\u0027s a true one.’One of the difficulties with a psychopath and a narcissist, as Mr Herba is, is that he behaves in such a way that it\u0027s almost impossible to believe that someone could be so stupid and so, in some ways, it\u0027s not surprising that the media found Chloe\u0027s story difficult to believe.Let\u0027s not forget she was bundled into a suitcase, injected with ketamine in the boot of a car and thought she was going to die.Herba claimed throughout the trial that the kidnapping was fake, a ruse dreamt up by him and Ms Ayling to make money by advancing her modeling career and landing her a role on reality TV.That was rejected outright by judges in Milan, who found him guilty of kidnapping and extortion and sentenced him to 16 years and nine months in prison.It is alleged that his brother, Michal Herba, 37, was also part of the plot. Italy is seeking his extradition from the UK, where he is in custody.During his summing up, the prosecutor in the case said that Ms Ayling could have died after being drugged with ketamine.Paolo Storari said that after the kidnap, in which Ms Ayling was zipped inside a canvas hold-all, she was handcuffed to furniture for at least the first night of her captivity.He told the court that Herba had bought two ski masks to use in the kidnapping and that he sent a note to his brother instructing him to scrub the boot of the car to make sure there were no traces of her DNA or strands of hair.In a statement to the court, Herba said he had fallen in love with the British model, from Coulsdon in Surrey, and the two had concocted the plot to make money.He said the website on which she was to have been auctioned as a sex slave, Black Death, was entirely fictitious.I never hurt the girl. I was not violent with her, Herba said. If she felt forced verbally in any way, I am very sorry. But it certainly was not as Chloe has described.I was in love and I was hoping that once her fame took off that she would repay me with feelings and we would share the money.”Katia Kolakowska, his lawyer, told the court that the kidnap plot closely resembled the plot of an American film called “By Any Means”.It was released a couple of months before the kidnapping.Chloe Ayling being interviewed upon her return to BritainIn a message to The  after the plot emerged, the film’s producers said: “We have been following the story closely and it is matching exactly the film. In the film, the girl gets kidnapped but the police question whether she is telling the truth because her story doesn’t add up.”The veracity of Ms Ayling’s account of the ordeal was questioned when it emerged that she had gone shopping for shoes with Herba during the kidnapping in the town of Viu’ in Piedmont, and had breakfast with him in a café on the day that he gave her up to the British consulate in Milan.When the Italian police asked her why she had not revealed the shopping trip to them, she began to cry.The young model said she went along on the shopping trip because by that time Herba had promised to set her free.In security camera footage shown to the court, Ms Ayling was seen holding hands with Herba while strolling through Turin.She claimed she did so because she was petrified and believed Herba when he said that they were being watched by other members of his gang.The police also asked her whether she had had sex with her captor, after they found traces of sperm on a bed in the farmhouse where she was held.She categorically denied that they had had sexual intercourse but admitted to sharing a double bed with him.“He tried to make sexual advances but I always rejected them, promising him a more intimate relationship in the future. I made him believe we could be more intimate when the whole thing ended.”Lukasz Herba\u0026#39s mugshot by the Italian policeIt also emerged that Ms Ayling had met Herba in Paris months before the alleged abduction. She went there for a fashion shoot and he presented himself as a photographer.But the shoot was cancelled after he claimed all his cameras had been stolen.After being questioned by police and allowed to return to Britain, Ms Ayling spoke to the media outside her home, saying that she had feared for her life second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour during the abduction. Herba had allegedly told her that young women who were sold as sex slaves to buyers in the Middle East were eventually discarded and “fed to the tigers” once their “owners” tired of them.Mr Pesce, the model’s Italian lawyer, said he would seek half a million euros in compensation in separate proceedings, while conceding it was unlikely that Herba would be able to pay.\u0026#39Feared hard man\u0026#39 ordered shooting of bouncer who ejected his son, court toldDonald Trump to tell Kim Jong-un he can stay in power - as long as he gives up nuclear weaponsGary Barlow gives up confetti cannons at outdoor shows as he is condemned for \u0026#39littering\u0026#39 the Eden ProjectSphinx row reignites between Egypt and China after replica reappearsCannabis oil for epileptic boy seized at Heathrow as mother says minister has signed his \u0026#39death warrant\u0026#39Singapore summit between the US and North Korea: Everything you need to know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s meeting with Kim Jong-UnWho’s at the negotiating table?

City analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent expansion.It was the worst monthly performance since October 2012.The ONS added that there was “widespread weakness” in the sector, with nine of the 13 sub-sectors\u0026nbspshowing a decline.The wider industrial sector, which includes energy firms, saw an 0.8 per cent fall, following a 0.1 per cent expansion in March.The Deputy Bank of England Governor Dave Ramsden said last week that recent survey data was supporting the Bank’s view that GDP growth would bounce back strongly in the second quarter.But the latest report on manufacturing, which accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP, suggests otherwise. The pound fell sharply in the wake of the figures, dropping to $1.3373, down 0.3 per cent on the day, as traders scaled back their bets on an August interest rate hike from the Bank.Construction output was also weaker than expected according to the ONS, growing by just 0.5 per cent, following the 2.3 per cent slump in March.Rounding off a hat-trick of disappointing news, the ONS separately reported that the goods trade deficit was wider than expected in April at £14.03bn, rather than the £11.35bn City analysts had pencilled in.On a three monthly basis the value of goods exports, excluding erratics, was down 3.7 per cent, while imports fell 2 per cent“It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,” said Suren\u0026nbspThiru\u0026nbspof the British Chambers of Commerce.The ONS’s analysis of the weakness of the economy in 2018 has been at odds with the Bank of England’s, with the statistics agency identifying underlying weakness, but the Bank attributing the slowdown almost entirely to the “Beast from the East” snowstorms of February and March.The Bank held off from raising interest rates in May, saying that it would wait to see if its more optimistic view would be bourne out.In the first quarter GDP growth is estimated to have slumped to just 0.1 per cent, with manufacturing growing by 0.2 per cent, services by 0.3 per cent and constriction slumping by 2.7 per cent.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) estimated on Monday\u0026nbspthat the UK\u0027s GDP growth rate was still only 0.2 per cent in the three months to May.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But in many cases, students were given warnings, fines or asked to apologise.In one case at Queen’s University Belfast, a student accused of Islamophobia was asked to write a 3,000 word reflective essay as punishment.Ilyas Nagdee, NUS black students’ officer, said that stories of perpetrators getting away with a “slap on the wrist” had meant many students were being put off from complaining about racism. “They don’t believe that they will actually see the justice they want to see,” he said.Of the universities contacted, around a third did not share the details of alleged racist incidents, with many citing the sensitive nature of the information. Meanwhile, some universities did not provide any information because they said they did not record incidents under the category of ‘racist’.Overall, there was not one consistent approach to recording the data – with some universities citing they only had access to formal complaints, rather than allegations raised through other outlets.James Kingett, from Show Racism the Red Card, said he was “concerned” by the rise and he added that it was “troubling” to hear of inconsistencies in terms of reporting across universities. \u0026nbspHe said: “Transparency of reporting is essential so that students and staff understand how incidents are defined, investigated and resolved.”The rise has come as hate crime incidents have increased across the country, showing that universities and education are not immune. “Incidents of racism are on the rise across the country and the developing body of evidence can no longer be ignored,” Mr Kingett said.Mr Nagdee added: “The first step has to be universities taking ownership and recognising the issue because until we do that, universities will continue to be perceived as liberal places of tolerance when unfortunately all the data, all the stories and all the evidence is telling us this is not the case.”On the figures obtained by The Independent, he added: “I am sure the total number of racist incidents is much much higher. I wouldn’t be surprised if the numbers are even higher in the future.”A recent social media campaign from the NUS saw more than 100 students come forward with stories of racism on campus across 30 universities in just one week – with some saying they were worried about their safety. “This is a daily reality for students across the country,” Mr Nagdee said.And students appear to be using social media more and more to report racist incidents, rather than through the formal university channels, in order to ensure action is taken as quickly as possible.\u0026nbspA student from Nottingham Trent pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment in court last month, after a student posted a video of him making racist chants outside her room on social media.And this year, Sheffield Hallam University began an investigation after a student tweeted that library staff had called him a monkey. It came after a banana was reportedly thrown at a black Sheffield Hallam graduate during an ice hockey game between his alma mater and the University of Sheffield.The University of Sheffield was forced to apologise for an “unacceptable delay” in the handling of the incident – which involved one of its students – and it said it would review its proceedings.Sheffield was one of the institutions that saw a rise in the number of racist incidents in two years, according to the new data, from three reports in 2015 to 11 in 2017.But many students have found it difficult to report racist incidents. Melinda Acquah, a third year at Sheffield University, has experienced racism – but she has not formally reported any incidents.One of her former housemates used the “n word” around her – which made her feel “uncomfortable” and singled out as the only BME student in the house. “I didn’t know how to report incidents like this to the university. I didn’t know how to deal with it,” she told The Independent.And it is not only students that face racism. A racist note was left on a staff member’s desk at the Royal Veterinary College in 2017 – but they failed to identify the perpetrator, the data shows.Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University College Union (UCU), said: “A number of shocking incidents have made headlines recently and while universities obviously must not tolerate this kind of behaviour, they need to be more proactive in stopping it.“All universities must make it clear how staff and students can report any incidents and those that do make reports must be confident they will be properly supported.”Sam Gyimah, universities minister, said: “There is absolutely no place for any form of hatred, discrimination or racism in society. Universities have clear responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 in this regard. I expect institutions to act swiftly to investigate and address hate crime, including racist related incidents reported to them.”A Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said: “Universities UK’s Taskforce has published recommendations to universities on dealing with hate crime affecting university students.“A recent follow-up report recommended that each university should consider having one system to collect, record and store data on all types of hate crime at their institution.”She added: “Following this report and recent high profile cases, we are redoubling our efforts to identify the scale of race based hate crime in universities and how they prevent and respond to incidents. This project will establish what further action should be taken and continue to offer best practice guidance.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.And a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The trip is only Mr Davis’s second visit to the de facto EU capital this year, with progress in talks having been slow. The minister declined to speak to the press during the trip.The “backstop solution” is supposed to prevent a hard border from emerging on the island of Ireland no matter what happens. Both sides say they do not want a hard border because the open frontier is part of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the Troubles.Mr Barnier last week said he was still studying the UK’s proposal and had not rejected it out of hand. When asked why he was doing so if it has such problems, he said: “Because I look at all British proposals in an objective manner.”The UK paper is the product of months of cabinet wrangling over how to temporarily solve the Irish border issue if it cannot be solved by a wider trade deal.\u0026nbspSeparately, the cabinet has still not decided on a single solution for the wider customs agreement between the UK and EU – with two options on the table. Both ideas, “max fac” and “customs partnership” have been rejected out of hand by Brussels.A spokesperson for the European Commission said: “We can confirm that the European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the secretary of state for exiting the European Union David Davis met this morning here in Brussels where they discussed the latest state of play of the Article 50 negotiations. They touched on issues related to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop for Ireland-Northern Ireland and the framework for the future relationship.”British officials confirmed a similar line neither side would give more details.Officials on both sides are getting ready for a European Council summit in March where member states will take stock over the state of negotiations so far.A UK Government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\u0026nbspWe are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The Commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.“All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier confirmed on Friday that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

City analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent expansion.It was the worst monthly performance since October 2012.The ONS added that there was “widespread weakness” in the sector, with nine of the 13 sub-sectors\u0026nbspshowing a decline.The wider industrial sector, which includes energy firms, saw an 0.8 per cent fall, following a 0.1 per cent expansion in March.The Deputy Bank of England Governor Dave Ramsden said last week that recent survey data was supporting the Bank’s view that GDP growth would bounce back strongly in the second quarter.But the latest report on manufacturing, which accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP, suggests otherwise. The pound fell sharply in the wake of the figures, dropping to $1.3373, down 0.3 per cent on the day, as traders scaled back their bets on an August interest rate hike from the Bank.Construction output was also weaker than expected according to the ONS, growing by just 0.5 per cent, following the 2.3 per cent slump in March.Rounding off a hat-trick of disappointing news, the ONS separately reported that the goods trade deficit was wider than expected in April at £14.03bn, rather than the £11.35bn City analysts had pencilled in.On a three monthly basis the value of goods exports, excluding erratics, was down 3.7 per cent, while imports fell 2 per cent“It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,” said Suren\u0026nbspThiru\u0026nbspof the British Chambers of Commerce.The ONS’s analysis of the weakness of the economy in 2018 has been at odds with the Bank of England’s, with the statistics agency identifying underlying weakness, but the Bank attributing the slowdown almost entirely to the “Beast from the East” snowstorms of February and March.The Bank held off from raising interest rates in May, saying that it would wait to see if its more optimistic view would be bourne out.In the first quarter GDP growth is estimated to have slumped to just 0.1 per cent, with manufacturing growing by 0.2 per cent, services by 0.3 per cent and constriction slumping by 2.7 per cent.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) estimated on Monday\u0026nbspthat the UK\u0027s GDP growth rate was still only 0.2 per cent in the three months to May.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I believe the horrifying murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May 2013 was a turning point.As the founder of Tell MAMA, I found myself in the unenviable position of having to mobilise my tiny team at the time to help the growing number of people being targeted at a street and online level by anti-Muslim hatred.The backlash was significant, given the targeting of a young soldier minding his own business and the brutal manner of the terrorist attack.In the aftermath, Ukrainian neo-Nazi Pavlo Lapshyn placed three bombs in mosques in Wolverhampton, Walsall and Tipton — two months after murdering Mohammed Saleem, a grandfather walking back home from his mosque in Birmingham.The past five years have seen no let-up in the UK.People acting alone and small insular cells of men, and increasingly women, have carried out attacks at London Bridge, in Manchester, Finsbury Park and Westminster Bridge.And let us not ­forget the multiple terrorist attacks on 7/7 and the attempted attacks on civilians on 21/7.Our country has had its fair share of local and national triggers for potential tensions, but the unique nature of British society has meant we have not seen riots on our streets, such as those in Oldham in 2001 — and this is something to be ­celebrated.Terrorist trigger points have clearly led to rises in anti-Muslim hate incidents and there have been points where our country has been under ­significant pressure.After 7/7 and the significant loss of life that took place then, Britain was on a heightened state of alert as another plot failed to deliver its deadly cargo and the police and security services were in a race to find members of that terror cell.Dubbed 21/7, the country was shaken, ­communities were fearful and there was a crackle in the air as some people aired their frustrations openly.Even after all of this, we as communities held together.There is therefore something unique in our country which means community violence has not broken out, whereas in other European ­countries there have been street clashes and the widespread intimidation of minority communities.That “uniqueness” in our country is based on the old tradition that is ingrained in our society — that of “live and let live”, and “fair play”.It also underscores that the space for the accommodation of ideas and new populations has been a fundamental and historic part of our country though today, with resource pressures, there are limits.However, this is not only one-way traffic, and a sense of pride and identity within groups such as Britain’s Muslims has shown itself time and time again.It is therefore important to note that while ­younger citizens are less proud to be English, poll after poll has shown that Muslims living here are more ­patriotic than the average Brit.This means many Muslims do feel pride in a country where they can worship freely, be who they want to be and have the ability to practice their faith how they want to.We also have to say what is patently obvious, that Muslims have more freedoms in the United Kingdom compared to their counterparts in ­mainland Europe, where veil bans, harassment and chronic unemployment blight Muslim and other minority communities.It is this freedom to worship without fear, allied to the British sense of fair play, that makes us a place many countries look up to.The fact is our futures are inter-related and will continue to be as people travel more and ­connect through social media.It also means many of our preconceptions of different communities will change over time.This can be a force for good, though hand-in-hand with this must be that there are a unique set of values in our country.They have held us together in the darkest moments and have strengthened our resolve to stand together. Of this, we can always be proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Odds on a record summer are shorter than ever.”The Met Office is warning emergency services, transport leaders, business chiefs and councils of the risks of a hotter-than-normal three months ahead.Britain is set to wilt due to high pressure, which brings hot and dry conditions, the Met Office said.Last year saw grim school holidays spoil summer, summer 2014 was ruined by rain following ex-Hurricane Bertha, and 2012 had the wettest summer for 100 years.But 2009 was a hot summer – and the 2006 summer sizzler saw a peak of 36.5C on July 19, at Wisley, Surrey.The Met Office June-August forecast said: “For June-August, above-average temperatures are more likely than below-average temperatures.“The probability the UK average temperature for June-August will fall into the warmest of our five categories is 40 percent.“The coldest of our five categories is around 5 percent.“The likelihood of above-average temperatures is greater than usual. The Met Office long-range prediction system shows a slightly increased chance of high-pressure patterns across the UK.”The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The warmest summer since 2006 is a possibility, after recent years saw a series of disappointing summers.“The June to August period only needs to be 1C above average for it to happen.”Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Channel, owned by The Weather Company, said: “33C is expected by early July as heat from high pressure over Britain builds.”Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: “Theres plenty of sunshine to come this week, with the South generally fine through the week, although the North-West will be changeable from Wednesday.“There is a signal for a gradual return to more settled weather through the end of June.

Hewill demand Britain continues to accept freedom of movement in exchange for unfettered access to Europe’s single market. But the Migration Watch think tank warned Mrs May that failure to curb EU migration after Brexit would destroy the Tory party’s credibility with voters.Its boss Lord Green said: “Controlling our borders must mean reducing immigration or it is pointless. 62% want to see a reduction in low skilled migration while 80% of EU migrants over the last ten years have been lower skilled. So any new arrangements must involve a sharp cut in immigration from the EU or the credibility of the Conservative government will be in shreds.”And Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful backbench European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the ambush would only backfire on the EU. He told The Sun: “If Brussels wants to do that it fails to realise why we voted to leave in the first place - it’s all about taking back control.“Clever ambushes are are yesterday’s story for the European Commission and they need to stop thinking along those lines. Their failure to do so is why Italy is unhappy, Hungary and so on. It’s a mindset that is actually turning nations against the European Union.”Meanwhile on Wednesday Home Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to announce the Government’s plans for the status of EU migrants already living in the UK. He has torn up plans by his predecessor Amber Rudd to offer preferential treatment to EU citizens after Brexit.Yesterday Labour frontbencher Andy McDonald said immigration could actually go up after Brexit. The shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said if businesses wanted more people to be allowed into Britain then the Government should allow that. His comments were described by one Tory MP as a “kick in the teeth for Brexit voters”.And his shadow cabinet colleague Sir Keir Starmer also hinted Labour is getting ready to U-turn on their pledge to end free movement.

The whole thing is keeping Theresa May so busy that she hasnt even had time to check in to this years Love Island villa at all.As the EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the House of Commons for a series of knife-edge votes this week, weve got some help for the Love Island ladies to understand whats really going on in our fight to quit the EU...In short, Hayley, Britain is leaving the European Union.In a historic vote in 2016 Brits voted to throw off the shackles of Brussels and go it alone, taking back control of our money, borders and laws.We officially kicked off the process in March 2017, and Theresa May now has less than a year to negotiate with the EU just how were going to leave, and whats happening next.But, to be honest, its not going all that well for her lately.If you think youve had a bad week, then all you have to do is look at the PMs Brexit crisis to surely feel a little bit better.Her Brexit secretary David Davis almost quit over controversial plans for Northern Ireland, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson started mouthing off about the Government at a private dinner and he even said that Donald Trump could get a better deal with the EU.Not ideal.And dont forget, shes already on the rocks with her own Tory MPs who think she cant handle one of the biggest challenges Britain has had to face in years - untangling ourselves from the shackles of the EU - and she is still facing the looming threat of Jeremy Corbyn snapping at her heels.So Mrs May really needs this crucial week to go well, otherwise her Brexit plans will be a total mess and she will face more calls to kick her out and replace her with someone new.The EU Withdrawal Bill is absolutely vital to make sure Britain is ready for Brexit.It will transfer all existing EU laws into British law, so there are no gaps after we finally quit the bloc.In essence, its proof to the European Union that we really are leaving and were getting on with it.So come on, lets start talking trade!And if Brussels think the PM is being dictated to by her own MPs it will make Britain look weak at the negotiating table, where were fighting for a decent trade deal.Theresa May needs to win to show shes under control.We must be in a strong position to get what we want - and these votes could bind the PMs hands completely.So far its gone through the House of Commons and passed through to the Lords with just one change to it.Now meddling peers have slapped on a whopping 15 changes to it, which if passed would tell Mrs May what to do in Brussels.These have nothing to do with the EU Bill itself - all this is about is putting EU laws into Britains books.Lords - many of whom voted to Remain - want to water the Bill down and change it to how they want.And if they could, many of them would opt to keep us in the EU after all.Peers in the upper chamber have changed Mrs Mays Bill several times which is causing her huge problems.The main one is on the customs union - which would force the Government to negotiate with the EU to keep Britain in the customs union after Brexit.That would help trade flow freely between the EU and the UK - but would also stop Britain striking new trade deals with the rest of the world, removing one of Brexit’s main advantages.Although it would not necessarily keep the UK in the customs union, it would make that outcome much more likely.Theres a chance this one could pass, leaving Mrs May weak and defeated.Perhaps the most damaging amendment for the Government’s Brexit plan is a motion to propel Britain into the European Economic Area.The EEA - which includes Norway and Iceland - incorporates the single market, so joining it would force us to continue free movement of people and keep most European laws. That wont fly with most Leavers.Some of the other changes include scrapping Brexit Day altogether (when we will finally exit the bloc), hanging on to EU rights, keeping our borders open to refugees and giving MPs the power to decide what happens if they vote down her final Brexit deal.The Government has also accepted several amendments to the Bill - including that the courts should refer to European Court of Justice judgements when relevant and clarifying the status of retained EU laws after exit dayThe Bill comes back for two days to the House of Commons tomorrow and Wednesday.They are set to have six hours to debate the changes and then vote on whether to accept or reject them.By tomorrow night well know whether these changes have been made.Most of them Mrs May is set to win - as they do have a majority in the House of Commons with the help of her coalition pals - the DUP.Their 10 MPs - who have promised to support her - will secure the votes needed for most of them to pass.But some Tory rebels are threatening to go to the other side and vote against her on some of the changes - like the ones on a vote on our Brexit deal, and the customs union plans.These ones are likely to be much, much closer, and will cause real problems if they are lost.The Government has already put down a number of concessions to plead with the MPs to come back onside, but will it work? Who knows.At the end of last year 11 Tories voted against the PM and issued a damning defeat on her.Its likely the same group could cause trouble again.They include leading Remainers Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, who all want the PM to compromise more.But leading rebel Ken Clarke yesterday admitted that the threat of rebellions was melting away because Tory MPs feared that inflicting government defeats this week would topple Mrs May after the turbulence of last week.Gosh, if only it were that easy.Some of these MPs are incredibly stubborn and think the changes to the Brexit Bill are more important than voting with their own leader and respecting the result of the referendum.Tonight the PM will issue a rallying cry to all Tory MPs to show the public they will deliver on Brexit ahead of the crunch votes tomorrow.She will make a crucial address to a meeting of all 316 Tory MPs in a last ditch bid to stave off a damaging rebellion over the Government’s Brexit plans.Yes, Brexit is still happening, no matter what happens at the end of these votes. Sorry, not sorry, Remainers!But they could totally change what Brexit looks like, and it could mean an utter betrayal of the result for millions of Leave-backers who wanted us to take back control.Staying inside a form of a customs union could mean having to accept thousands more people coming freely into Britain with no checks.Two years after the referendum, plenty of people are unhappy that ministers are STILL squabbling over the ins and outs of what our position is.After these crunch votes are done, some are warning shell face a leadership challenge and another top Tory will swoop in to take her place.If she loses them, a new Prime Minister could come sooner than you might think."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412519451.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kate middleton polo pitch star player kiss","story":"But pictures taken from a different angle at the event in Gloucestershire on Sunday reveal Kate was running to give one of the star players a kiss - and its not who you think it is.Kate attended the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club with Prince George and Princess Charlotte to cheer on the Duke of Cambridge as he played in the match on Sunday June 10.In the photos, Kate can be seen sprinting from the grass bank where she had been sitting with her children and towards the marquees.While it was previously thought she was running with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the photos show Kate was running towards Malcolm Borwick, Prince Williams team mate for the match.After the little princess joins her, Kate turns to Malcolm, who has played for England, and gives him an air-kiss on both sides of his cheek and a warm hug.Malcolm was wearing No3 for the Maserati team, while Prince William played as No4.The pair have previously played together at the 2017 Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy match, and the former England international is friends with both Prince William and Prince Harry.In May last year, Malcolm told The Sun he has offered to teach Meghan Markle how to play polo after she cheered on Harry while he played in Ascot.He told The Sun: “I met Meghan the other day for the first time - she’s a really, really nice person.“She’s not a polo player, but she’s very keen to learn and I’ve offered to teach her.”Also at Sundays match, playful Prince George took aim with a toy gun as he and sister Charlotte — gripped by watchful mum Kate — enjoyed a day in the sun watching dad William play polo.Adorable Princess Charlotte, 3, was seen doing rolly-pollies as she showed off to her giggling mum — and tearing across the fields in her bare feet after her older brother.She was also pictured being cuddled by Kate as the family relaxed on the sidelines.Earlier Kate, 36, comforted tearful George as he became overwhelmed with excitement — but the young prince was soon mucking about once again.The match was all in aid of two charities close to the princes heart — the Royal Marsden Hopsital, which the Duke supports as president, and homeless charity Centrepoint, of which he is patron.Sundays match was part of a series of charitable polo matches that the Duke and Prince Harry will play in this summer.The two brothers have taken part in polo fixtures in support of their charities since 2007, and have continued each year since, raising over £11 million for charitable causes to date."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000405773237.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mcdonalds new toilet rule customers wet themselves","story":"In order to use the bathroom at the fast-food restaurant in Maroochydore, Queensland, customers claim they have to first place their order and use the code on the bottom of the receipt to get access to the toilet - a system in place at multiple McDonalds restaurants in the UK.Numerous people have taken to social media to criticise the policy and claim the amount of extra time it takes to go the bathroom has already caused one “accident” and other near-misses.Maroochydore local Kim McDonald shared a picture of the sign informing customers of the location’s policy.  The sign was attached to the toilet door and read: “Toilets proudly provided for the use of McDonald’s customers. Code on bottom of receipt.”Ms McDonald posted the image to social media after going to the fast food store for lunch with her 90-year-old grandmother.Her grandma has to use a walker to get around and she said this meant it took them about five minutes to walk from the carpark to the toilets, only to realise that they had to walk back and order to get in.  “At least 10 or so minutes would have passed where a near 90-year-old has had to hold their bladder,” Ms McDonald wrote.“They are lucky they didnt need to get out the mop and buckets. And probably lucky I didnt have my kids with me too.” She thought that the locks may have been introduced as a way to stop drunk youths from vandalising the bathrooms late at night but still described it as a “bit of an overkill”.“Why cant the doors be unlocked until a later time like 8pm or something to allow easy access to the bathrooms for kids, pregnant ladies and disabled or elderly people?” Ms McDonald wrote.A couple of weeks earlier another woman, Jo Anne, took to Facebook to complain about the toilet policy claiming her child had an “accident” because of the coded locks.  “Today my child has an accident because you lock the toilets and only put the code on the receipt,” she said.“They WERE customers who were using your facility and had decided (like plenty of other parents) to have a play in the playground before ordering their afternoon ice cream treat.”She added that the store “failed” to meet the standard expected of McDonald’s restaurants.A McDonald’s spokesperson responded to Jo Anne’s criticism saying they would raise the concerns with the Maroochydore location.A spokeswoman for the chain told theABC it is not policy to lock bathroom doors but it was the decision of the store.“The local licensee has made this decision, however, they are able to be opened for anyone who requires them,” she said.A version of this article was originally published on news.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004100417457.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"1960","title":"kim jong un intelligence files school boy switzerland","story":"The analysis carried out for America and South Korea paints a picture of a young Kim which bears striking similarities with his 36-year-old self.A source who spoke to new-site Axios said: “The picture that emerged from literally dozens of interviews bears a striking similarity with the man he has emerged into today,“Gluttonous, prone to fits of anger and swaggering around his classmates. “Kim Jong-un was an [inattentive] student but demanded slavish loyalty from other children in his wake.”The findings came about after compiling and analysing numerous interviews with teachers, students and others who knew him at his prestigious Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in Koeniz, south of Bern.Kim attended from the age of 11 in 1994 and stayed there until 1997.The source even alleged young Kim was something of a hooligan who “frequently” hit other students, didn’t do well in school and was often distracted.But chillingly after games the North Korean would reportedly declare: “Someday you will all remember me.”The alleged revelations comes as the two leaders, both who have very strong personalities, meet in Singapore in a bid to avert war breaking in the Korean peninsula over Kim’s nuclear missile programme.

Wonsan is one of several special economic zones in North Korea. It\u0027s a model similar to the one pioneered by China when it opened up in the late 1970s. In theory, there are several benefits.\"North Korea could conduct special policies and give all kinds of privileges to foreign companies to do business in that area,\" Prof Cheng said.\"Also, the special economic zones could help isolate this area from the other part of North Korea so North Korea could go ahead with some special arrangement with foreign economies.\"But reality - and North Korea\u0027s pursuit of the nuclear part of the Byungjin line - got in the way of the plan. \"You see in the past years North Korea has set up more than 20 special economic areas but they\u0027ve basically failed because of international sanctions - foreign companies aren\u0027t allowed to invest in the country.\"That\u0027s what Mr Kim wants from the summit: not economic aid from the US (North Korean statements have been scathing about that idea) but the opportunity to attract foreign investment. That requires sanctions being lifted.Dandong is a Chinese city on the China-North Korea border on the other side of the Yalu River is Sinuiju, another North Korean special economic zone. A single-lane bridge connects the two countries. Here we saw an uneven flow of trucks, trains and tourist make the journey across.Further along the river, there\u0027s an impressive new bridge. It was completed in 2015. Well, nearly. The North Korean side ends in a field, with no connection to a road. Dandong is primed for North Korean trade but it\u0027s currently on pause. We visited the main fish market, which used to stock plenty of North Korean seafood. Sanctions imposed in 2017 put an end to that, although China is said to have relaxed the ban recently. We were offered North Korean clams, which are prized for their sweetness.Residents are optimistic about the US-North Korean summit - and what it means for their wealth. Zhang Tong, an estate agent working at Moon Island, a complex of soaring towers, says the summit has accelerated sales.She gestures to the North Korean side, in full view from the balcony of one show home. \"In front of us, several years ago, there weren\u0027t too many buildings,\" she said.\"If North Korea develops well, I think the friendship between China and North Korea will go better. And the economy and trade between the two countries will develop better too.\"And Dandong\u0027s economy will develop better too.\"None of that comes without risk, though - not least for Mr Kim himself, both internationally and domestically.Prof Cheng said: \"This time, when North Korea tried to change its gears, to single mindedly focus on economic development - such changes met resistance from other North Korean elites.\"Recently Kim Jong Un sacked three military guys - and that\u0027s the indication it\u0027s not easy for North Korea to change its policy in very dramatic ways.\" Mr Kim\u0027s nuclear arsenal might appear to give him a position of strength but the reality is more precarious. He must deliver economic growth to preserve his rule.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt unveiled a shake-up today after a backlash over the treatment of paediatrician Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba.  She was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death at of six-year-old Jack Adcock after he developed sepsis in 2011.  A tribunal ruled Dr Bawa-Garba, who was working at Leicester Royal Infirmary at the time, should remain on the medical register despite her conviction. But in January the General Medical Council (GMC) had her struck off after taking the case to the High Court.  The GMC\u0027s actions angered campaigning doctors, who said issues like dangerous understaffing, IT failures and inappropriate work conditions were ignored. Now Mr Hunt has announced he has accepted the main findings of a review into the use of gross negligence manslaughter in the NHS. The review, by eminent surgeon Professor Sir Norman Williams, was launched amid fears the fear of criminal proceedings was having a chilling effect. Tory minister Mr Hunt said: When something goes tragically wrong in healthcare, the best apology to grieving families is to guarantee that no-one will experience that same heartache again. I was deeply concerned about the unintended chilling effect on clinicians\u0027 ability to learn from mistakes following recent court rulings. And the actions from this authoritative review will help us promise them that the NHS will support them to learn, rather than seek to blame.  Sir Norman\u0027s report calls for a clearer understanding of when proceedings for gross negligence manslaughter should be brought in healthcare. Medics should be reassured they would apply only in cases of very poor performance and not honest mistakes, the report says. While accepting the findings, Mr Hunt has sought to reassure patients and their families that there will be improved scrutiny of deaths in the NHS, with the roll-out of a system of medical examiners - senior doctors who will look at all patient deaths which are not referred to a coroner. Official said the changes would mean bereaved families would get more information about the circumstances of their loved ones\u0027 deaths while more data would be shared across the NHS to help prevent avoidable deaths.

They\u0027re both men with a short fuse. They\u0027re both suspicious of US media. And they both have their fingers on the nuclear button. But you\u0027d have to be pretty brave to call them both dictators. That\u0027s just what a bungling Fox News host did, however, as the pair landed in Singapore for a first-of-its-kind summit. Abby Huntsman later apologised for her comments on TV as Trump stepped out of Air Force One.  She said during Fox \u0026amp Friends: This is history, we are living history. Regardless of what happens in that meeting between the two dictators, what we are seeing right now, this is history.  Later she admitted: I do want to point out that earlier, as you know on live TV sometimes you don’t always say things perfectly. I called both President Trump and Kim Jong-un a dictator. I did not mean that, my mistake, so I apologise for that.  North Korean media today hailed a new era and Trump tweeted there was excitement in the air! in a heady build-up to the summit in Singapore. The US President is expected to be alone in a room with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for up to two hours when they meet from 2am UK time on Tuesday. Only translators will be present for the meeting at a luxury Singapore resort, a US official said - suggesting there will be no aides or note-takers, a highly unusual move. Officials could then drop in for a further hour but they admitted: We will not be surprised by any scenario.  Trump himself has said he could make a decision in the first minute or spur of the moment - raising the possibility he could make a commitment with no aides or note-takers present. Both leaders were kicking their heels today after arriving more than 24 hours early - while their officials rolled the pitch with two hours of initial talks. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the initial talks, thought to focus on nuclear weapons and sanctions, were moving quite rapidly. We anticipate that they will come to their logical conclusion even more quickly than we anticipated, he added.

The Prime Minister will appeal for support as she addresses a make-or-break meeting of the 1922 Committee - a group for backbench Tories. Her speech in Parliament comes amid fresh questions over her future as the EU Withdrawal Bill reaches its climax. MPs will vote on 15 amendments this week which, if passed, would tear up Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan and leave Britain closer to EU rules. The Prime Minister will tell her MPs: We must be clear that we are united as a party in our determination to deliver on the decision made by the British people. They want us to deliver on Brexit and build a brighter future for Britain as we take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.  The Prime Minister is now caught in a double bind between Remainers and Brexiteers in her own party. On the one hand, she has to persuade Remainers she will listen to their fears about Hard Brexit and stop them rebelling this week. On the other, she has to persuade angry Brexiteers that she\u0027ll make Brexit \u0027hard\u0027 enough to stop them toppling her later on.  A source told the Sunday Times she is “toast” once the Bill finishes its journey through Parliament. Prominent Tories have spent the last day speaking out against the rumours and trying to ensure unity. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd , a Remainer, and Brexit-backing Iain Duncan Smith called on Tories to “march in lockstep” ahead of the crunch Brexit Bill votes tomorrow and Wednesday.  They said a lack of Tory unity could hand power to Labour, warning: “We cannot allow ourselves to become divided and risk losing the precious chance to go on implementing policies that transform lives.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful Hard Brexit-backing European Research Group, called on Brexiteer MPs to show patience but admitted it was not going as fast as he\u0027d like.  Tory MP and former Vote Leave campaigner Theresa Villiers played down any talk of a coup, saying: I think it would be totally the wrong thing to do to any way undermine the prime minister. It comes after a week in which Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to quit and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that US President Donald Trump would be better at negotiating the UK’s EU withdrawal.  Former Chancellor Ken Clarke also called for unity. He said: “We need to rescue the Prime Minister from this terrible treatment she is getting from key members of her Cabinet.” Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer downplayed the votes this week as Labour faces its own split over whether to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which would mean following single market rules. The Norway model refers to countries being members of the European Economic Area (EEA), but not the European Union. Remaining in the EEA would grant Britain all the freedoms of the EU’s internal market - including the free movement of goods and people. Norway is an EEA member, which is why it\u0027s called the Norway model. It means the country is bound by all the EU regulations for those areas, as well as policies on employment, the environment and consumer protection. But, like Norway, it means the country does not have a say in how those policies are formulated. He said: “The idea that this is the last-chance saloon on a single-market deal is misconceived. There will be another chance with those bills.” Mr Davis is currently in Brussels for further talks with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The PM’s deputy, David Lidington , denied talks were doomed. “We have put something on the table. Michel Barnier has responded constructively. “I am not expecting a meltdown.” MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - the law that enacts Brexit. Theresa May wants MPs to overturn 15 amendments, passed by the House of Lords, that would push Britain towards a much softer Brexit. It could make or break her premiership so she\u0027s been pleading for Tory Remain-backers not to vote against the government. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a summary of the original 15 Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they would achieve if they pass.  Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. It could force her back to the negotiating table instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment. (1, 3)  For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of the above will be overturned, some could pass if there\u0027s a Tory rebellion. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through."},{"url":null,"title":"tories deal fresh blow british","story":"NewsTories deal fresh blow to British steel industry as they admit foreign steel will be used to build latest Royal Navy support shipsDefence Minister Guto Bebb confirmed foreign metal would be used for the vessels - and signalled they would be built abroad\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor15:46, 11 JUN 2018NewsThe Fleet Solid Support Ships will perform a vital role resupplying Navy vessels, including the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMinisters dealt another blow to the British steel industry today by admitting they will use foreign metal to build new Royal Navy support ships. The Government also dropped its heaviest hint yet it will build three vital Fleet Solid Support ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in an overseas yard. Defence Minister Guto Bebb said that while warships had to be built in the UK “other ships are open to international competition”.  The Ministry of Defence does not class the RFA ships as warships - despite the fact they could go to war supporting aircraft carriers, destroyers and frigates, and are also armed with guns. And Mr Bebb admitted foreign steel would be used to construct the vessels because British plants to do not make the specific type needed. But under-pressure producers have consistently said they could supply the metal if they were told far enough in advance. Shadow Steel Minister Gill Furniss pressed the Tories to commit to backing UK industry during defence questions in the Commons.  “The Government has often used EU rules as an excuse for not buying British steel for big defence projects,” she said. He called on the Government to “guarantee that post-Brexit Royal navy support ships and similar projects will use 100% British steel”. But Defence Minister Guto Bebb shrugged off the plea, claiming: “I wish I could offer that guarantee but it’s not possible to offer the guarantee because the steel required for parts of the ship that we are building is not currently available from the UK.” Using British steel risked building faults into the vessels, he told MPs. Labour would “be the first to complain if we had defects in our capability as a result of buying incorrect steel”. Calling for the Government to build the ships in Britain, Labour’s former Defence Minister John Spellar fumed that small and medium-sized businesses relied on bigger companies handing them contracts.

Her horrified parents have revealed their daughter is in intensive \u0026shytherapy after \u0026shygetting hooked on the Fortnite game. Over 40 million have \u0026shydownloaded the so-called \u0026shysurvival shooter game since it was launched last July, sparking \u0026shyrecord numbers of digital addiction. Experts fear she is one of many children at risk of developing mental health problems as a \u0026shyresult of over-exposure to the fight-to-the-death scenarios. The obsessed primary school pupil...  Secretly got up in the night and played until dawn Neglected to go to the toilet because she could not bear to leave the screen Hit her father in the face when he tried to confiscate her Xbox gaming console Dozed off in class because of her night-time addiction   The girl’s mum told the Sunday People: “We had no idea, when we let her play the game, of the \u0026shyaddictive nature or the impact it could have on her mental health.  She is in \u0026shytherapy for the addiction after she \u0026shybecame withdrawn, \u0026shyagitated and disturbed from playing up to ten hours a day – sometimes playing until dawn, wetting \u0026shyherself so she didn’t have to leave the screen. “This is a serious issue which is destroying our little girl’s life and someone needs to step in to ban it before it becomes an epidemic.” Fortnite has been endorsed by a multitude of top sport and music stars. The game’s most popular format is the Battle Royale in which 100 players fight each other until one is left standing. Although the game is free to download, its developers make money from hooked users who pay for in-game purchases to boost their performances. Is your child being treated for an addiction? Email webnews@mirror  Mum Carol, 36, said they bought their daughter an Xbox in January and shortly after she downloaded Fortnite. She and her husband Richard, who we are not picturing to protect the identity of their daughter, say it was not until mid-March they noticed \u0026shyworrying signs. Carol said: “We got called in by her head \u0026shyteacher asking if \u0026shyeverything was OK. She had fallen asleep twice in lessons and her grades were slipping. “When we asked our daughter what the \u0026shyproblem was, she became unusually \u0026shyargumentative and aggressive, which we just put down to her hormones.” But soon the sports-mad girl started saying she too tired to go to gym or ballet classes, as well as missing the family visits to church on Sunday mornings. Noticing small but regular payments on their credit card to Microsoft, adding up to over \u0026pound50 a month, they asked if she knew anything about this. The mum said: “Our daughter told us it could be some extras she’d paid for on Fortnite. “Of course we were furious and confiscated her Xbox. But then she lashed out and hit my husband in the face.” Despite limiting their daughter’s time on the game to one hour on school nights and two on weekends, they were still suspicious. Carol said: “My husband saw her light on in the night and found her sitting on a urine-soaked \u0026shycushion playing the game. “I found her backside was red-raw. She was so hooked to the game she wouldn’t even go to the toilet.”   The next morning they sat her down and asked her to tell the truth. The mum said: “Crying, she told us that every night for the past two months she had waited until we were asleep and then got up to play, sometimes until 5am. “We worked out that she could have been playing for up to ten hours a day, and we’d had no idea.” The parents contacted addictions counsellor Steve Pope, who agreed to see the girl for psychotherapy.  Steve told the Sunday People: “Over the last two months I’ve been \u0026shycontacted by dozens of parents with children as young as eight showing signs of addiction to Fortnite. “I’ve been working in this field for three decades and never seen anything like it, how widespread and potentially damaging this is. “I know bright kids who will fail their exams this summer because of Fortnite, kids who are stealing from their parents and friends to pay for the extras, kids who urinate in bottles because they can’t bear to leave the game.”  Experts claim it is the high-profile celebrity \u0026shyendorsements in recent weeks that have fuelled exposure. Steve added: “You see Premier League footballers celebrating goals with Fortnite dances and it’s the biggest possible advert for kids. “It’s the perfect gateway into \u0026shyaddiction and gambling.”  Professional gamers are making up to \u0026pound500,000 a month from live-streaming their Fortnite games for addicted children to watch. The nine-year-old girl in our \u0026shyreport is slowly \u0026shygetting back on track with her sports and schooling.

The Spurs midfielder, who did the game’s “floss dance” to celebrate an FA Cup semi-final goal last month, said: “I think that it’s a great way to relax and rest your body playing \u0026shyPlayStation. “I’d say I am the best \u0026shyFortnite player. I’ve won over 100 games. But a lot of the boys have just started playing it.  “We play in teams so it \u0026shydefinitely brings us together.” Cardiff defender Callum Paterson has made Fortnite celebrations his speciality. And France international Griezmann regularly performs the “Take The L”dance after a goal. In the Fortnite game the dances are performed to celebrate a killing an opponent. Other celebrity fans of the game include Argentinian aces Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero. The obsession with Fortnite even extends to watching others play.  Last month an online video of Canadian rapper Drake playing Fortnite with pro-player Ninja was watched more than 600,000 times. Ninja – real name Tyler Blevins – reportedly makes nearly \u0026pound400,000 a month from live-streaming himself playing the game on Twitch, a live version of YouTube. Fortnite’s makers, Epic Games, have even announced a Fortnite Celebrity Pro-Am which will pair 50 celebrities and 50 pro players. Fear behind fun Internet Matters ambassador and psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos says: “Games can become quite addictive for children because they’re fun in the way that cartoons are fun. “A lot of apps or games act on the brain in the same way that an itch that needs to be scratched.

The family went to watch Prince William play in the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucestershire - and it looks like they had a brilliant day. There are lots of pictures of adorable Prince George and Princess Charlotte running around, rolling in the grass and playing just like normal kids. Royal fans particularly loved one photo of Kate, dressed in a blue \u0026pound39 Zara dress, running across the pitch. But a closer look shows she\u0027s not actually running to meet Wills, but she\u0027s actually rushing to see one of his pals.  Malcolm Borwick played alongside the prince for the charity match, and he\u0027s been good friends with William and Harry for a long time. Kate was then spotted giving Malcolm a kiss on the cheek and a hug.  Malcolm was standing outside a marquee with some of the other players and supporters when Kate ran over. He looked very happy to see her and Princess Charlotte and had a huge smile on his face.  Prince George showed of his impressive artistic skills during the event, and was proudly walking around with a lovely picture of a volcano. However he\u0027s also sparked a huge debate after being spotted playing with a toy gun. Princess Charlotte could be seen running around wearing an adorable patterned dress and sunglasses. It appears the littlest Cambridge Prince Louis stayed at home for the day.   Sunday\u0027s fun day out couldn\u0027t have been more different to Saturday, when the family took centre stage for the Trooping of the Colour parade .  The event, which celebrates the Queen\u0027s official birthday, is one of the most important events in the royal calender and sees the whole gang stand on the Buckingham Palace balcony to wave to well-wishers and see the flypast.

Charlotte Caldwell\u0027s 12-year-old son Billy suffers up to 100 epileptic fits a day. The pair had travelled to Toronto on Thursday to get a six-month supply of cannabis oil to help treat his symptoms but the oil was confiscated by border officials when they tried to re-enter Britain. Ms Caldwell, from Northern Ireland, is scheduled to meet with Home Office Minister Nick Hurd about her son\u0027s medication needs on Monday.  It\u0027s Billy\u0027s anti-epileptic medication that Nick Hurd has taken away, it\u0027s not some sort of joint full of recreational cannabis, she told a press conference. I will just go back to Canada and get more and I will bring it back again because my son has a right to have his anti-epileptic medication in his country, in his own home. Let me tell you something now: we will not stop, we are not going to stop, we are not going to give up, we have love, hope, faith for our kids and we are going to continue. She said Billy was due his next dose at 3.30pm, and warned of the dangers of missing his first treatment in 19 months. The reason they don\u0027t do it is that it can cause really bad side-effects - they wean them down slowly. So what Nick Hurd has just done is most likely signed my son\u0027s death warrant.  She said she would be meeting Mr Hurd at the Home Office on Monday afternoon to plead to him parent to parent to get the oil back. Ms Caldwell, 50, said she was absolutely devastated to have the supply taken away after declaring it to border officials, and claimed one welled up with tears while doing it. They are parents themselves and they were very conflicted about removing the medication from me in fact. one of them had tears in their eyes when he was doing it. They did not want to do it, she said.

The future king was with his sister Princess Charlotte and mum Kate as they watched his dad, the Duke of Cambridge, take part in a polo match.  The four-year-old royal was seen looking down the barrel of the toy as he and other youngsters played with fake weapons and handcuffs during the family day out. At one point George, who has shown an interest in the police, even seemed to jokingly tease his mum by pointing the gun at her chin.  It is understood that George\u0027s toy was a water pistol that wasn\u0027t purchased for the young prince. It was won as a prize at a children\u0027s fair at Sunday\u0027s Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy match. The images sparked a debate on Twitter with anger and disappointment expressed by some, and others saying it was simply a case of \u0027kids being kids\u0027 that wasn\u0027t a big deal. But critics have said fake weapons shouldn\u0027t be seen as fun toys, and George and the other children shouldn\u0027t have been allowed to play with them.    The young prince did play with other toys, including a colourful \u0027slinky\u0027. Some critics argued that the toy guns - dark in colour with an orange plastic ring around the end of the barrel - looked too much like the real thing. One Twitter user wrote: Sad to see George playing with a gun when the whole country has a gun/knife crime situation. Maybe in training for killing wild life in later years. Thought he was a sensitive child. Better if he was seen playing with a toy car or football. Sadly the royals will never change.  This year has seen a surge in violent crime in London, with the Met Police launching at least 74 murder investigations so far. Another tweeted: This isn’t okay anymore... My American side here, biased maybe b/c of everyday #gunviolence in USA, but my British side agrees. No child in this day and age should look at any gun as a fun toy. This looks far too real. (And I LOVE Prince George, don’t get me wrong!). And one wrote: Here’s why the sight of Prince George playing with a toy gun is triggering for some of us. Black mothers in the US have to teach their sons not to play with anything (a toy gun, a cell phone, etc.) a policeman could claim looked like a real gun. Their lives depend on it.  Other Twitter users\u0027 came to George\u0027s defence following the polo event at Beaufort Polo Club, Gloucestershire. One wrote: Can’t believe people are booting off about Prince George playing with a toy gun and handcuffs! He’s a child most likely playing cops and robbers! People are so dramatic. Another added: Prince George was playing with a toy gun? So what! It’s a toy! People get over yourselves and let others parent how they see fit as long as they’re not causing harm or anguish to their kids. Some pointed to the fact that George comes from a family with a military and hunting background.

The royal cousins were seen adorably playing together at a polo match this afternoon, giggling as they relaxed on the grass at Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucstershire. The duo seem inseparable, never straying too far from each other.  But at one point, it all got too much for little George who had a tearful moment and needed to be consoled by his mum, Kate. He seemed to have a sad look on his face as his doting mum took him into a loving embrace, tenderly stroking his cheek with a concerned look on her face.    It comes just one day after the Trooping the Colour celebrations, where sassy Savannah, seven, hilariously put her hand over George\u0027s mouth to shush him during the National Anthem.

Savannah is one of the Queen\u0027s great grandchildren, and her dad Peter Phillips is Princess Anne\u0027s son.  It was held as part of a series of charitable polo matches that Prince Harry and Prince William will play in this summer, to raise money for the Royal Marsden and Centrepoint. The little prince, who is shy and reserved, held a mini mallet as he played in the grass, mimicking his dad, William, who was taking part. He kicked off his shoes and even guided his big cousin, seemingly showing her how it\u0027s done.

Hannah Sandover, 18, had been dating her ex-boyfriend, also 18, for nearly a year when they split. She later told a pal he had spiked her water bottle and forced himself on her in the back of his car during a trip to the Westbury White Horse in Wiltshire. Her worried friend went to police and Sandover gave a statement saying: He became forceful and pinned me down, I kept telling him to stop. I think he had drugged the water I was drinking.  She claimed she got into the back of car to stretch out in an attempt to ease stomach pains, before her former boyfriend jumped on her. Sandover, who was from Southwick, Wiltshire, at the time, said a friend was sitting in the front of the car, but was listening to music through headphones. But when she was taken to a clinic for an intimate examination her story started to change as she admitted she hadn\u0027t been drugged. And when her family began to question the story, Sandover admitted she made it all up and the pair had engaged in consensual sex.  She admitted a charge of wasting police time at Salisbury Magistrates\u0027 Court and was on Friday given a four-month suspended sentence. Sandover was also given a restraining order stopping her from contacting her former lover for two years, ordered to pay \u0026pound200 in compensation and complete up to 15 days of rehabilitation activity requirement. Prosecutor Ryan Seneviratine said: Miss Sandover is extremely lucky that she didn\u0027t get charged with perverting the course of justice, only due to her age and the fact she has no previous convictions. Her ex-boyfriend has said his confidence in approaching girls has been completely ruined.

The paramedic has told how he spotted the youngsters sweating away inside a sealed parked car as temperatures hit 27C. Fearing for their safety, he noted the registration and went inside the store in Lydney, Gloucestershire, to alert the driver. But he claimed he was told by a security guard that the information could not be used because of data protection. Tesco has told him it will investigate the incident. The paramedic returned to the car and was about to call police to tell them he was going to break in to save life when the children\u0027s mother returned. At a starting temperature of 27C, the heat inside a sealed car is likely to exceed 38C within 20 minutes. After half an hour it could be approaching 48C.  He complained about the “awful” experience on Sunday afternoon in a post on Tesco\u0027s Facebook page. He wrote: “My wife, daughter and I popped in for a few bits following a day out. “We parked in one of the parent and child spaces and immediately noticed the black car next to us with two unattended young children in it, sweating away. “The thermometer in our silver car read 27C so I can’t imagine how hot they must have been sealed in that black car.  He added: I immediately went to a member of staff who was in the car park, he took the registration and went to do an announcement for the parent. “We also mentioned it to the security guard. Very worryingly his response was, ‘Oh we can’t do anything about that for data protection reasons\u0027. “He then stopped the other member of staff from taking any action. He then said he would look into it. “I was waiting for an announcement to come out whilst we did our shopping, but nothing ever came.  He wrote: “It turns out the security guard chose to ignore the situation and decided to make no attempt to help the children. “This is incredibly dangerous, the mother should be ashamed of herself but so should the Tesco security guard. The man, who lists his occupation as a paramedic clinical adviser with Care UK, said that as a paramedic he is well aware of how quickly the children could have become unconscious and died.

Esther Taylor, who watched her mum battle the disease, has a gene mutation meaning she is at high risk. She underwent the gruelling nine-hour double mastectomy on March 2 in a preventative operation to beat the scourge of cancer which has haunted her family. Now, Esther believes she can look with optimism to a healthy future despite many thinking she was “too young” to make such a major decision.  The paediatric nurse from Preston, Lancs., has been offered support from Liberty X pop star Michelle Heaton, who also underwent the procedure. Speaking about the thought process behind the operation, the now 25-year-old said: “It was a difficult decision, it is scary, it is painful, it is risky and it is emotional, but ultimately it is brave, it is beautiful and it is life changing. “A lot of people I have told think I’m ‘too young’ to make this sort of decision, but if you knew you were living with a high risk of developing breast cancer and you had a choice to significantly reduce the risk, then why wouldn’t you?”  Blood tests had previously revealed Esther had a rogue unidentified gene, putting her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. It follows several members of her family being diagnosed with cancer including aunties, uncles and her mum Patsy Fenning, who was struck down in her 40s. Esther said: “My mum comes from a big family, I have sadly lost many members of my family to cancer and the majority of aunts and uncles that are still alive have suffered cancer, too.  “It suddenly hit me, there came a time when a cancer diagnosis in the family no longer shocked me. “I think at that point I realised it was a complete injustice to all these family members dying if I didn’t do something about it. “Ultimately, I didn’t want the deaths of those so close to me to be for nothing. I wanted to celebrate them with life.  Having had to watch, care and endure her own mum Patsy’s suffering when she was just eight years old, Esther, says the ‘C’ word was never far from her mind. Esther’s surgery, a nine-hour operation, took place on March 2 at Wythenshawe Hospital. Prior to the op, she had a ‘Bye Bye Boob’ party with colleagues from Royal Blackburn Hospital at a friend\u0027s house.  She admits, while the scars of the surgery are healing, emotionally and mentally she still has a way to go with further big decisions to face at a later date and taking confidence in a look that she still finds a little ‘alien\u0027. She added: “I went for a very like-for-like look, same size boobs and shape. “This for me was never a ‘boob job’ or a cosmetic decision. These aren’t my boobs.

Between April and November last year, she used its website to order goods - mainly clothing - and claimed refunds for a large amount of items, despite not sending them back. The 25-year-old, from Priestfields in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, had denied the charge of fraud by making a false representation but she was found guilty at a trial heard in May.  At sentencing on Thursday, Teesside Magistrates\u0027 Court heard the value of the goods gained fraudulently by O’Gorman was unknown. District Judge Timothy Capstick said: “Not every one was fraudulent but clearly there was a system in place and you knew how this particular shop operated. “It is quite clear there was a degree of sophistication in this offence. “The cost to the store is not clear but must have run into hundreds of pounds.” A report from the probation service said O’Gorman continued to maintain her innocence, insisted she returned the goods and “doesn’t see George as victims”.

Extend your space  No matter how spacious your caravan there\u0027s always going to be the need for a bit more space. With the glorious summer weather there\u0027s no reason not to move outside and create an additional living area, a lounge outdoors if you like.  The Urban Escape Event Shelter , above, has two sides and offers 50+ UPF, which means it filters out up to 98 per cent of UV rays. The water resistance is also capable of seeing off moderate rain too.   Rain or shine a gazebo is a great way to keep you comfortable. They offer shelter if it rains and sun protection if it\u0027s gloriously hot.    While you\u0027re out in the sun enjoying lunch you\u0027ll probably want something to sit on too, so take a look at the Urban Escape Folding Chairs , above, in either black or blue, for \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound20) or treat yourself to the ultimate in luxury with the Urban Escape King Size Moonchair , now just \u0026pound30 (save \u0026pound30).

You won\u0027t want to lug around a massive cooker though, so consider the Halfords Briefcase BBQ , a compact little device that will allow you to cook for a couple of people, or get two for larger families - they\u0027re only \u0026pound10 each (save \u0026pound5).

Pair this with the outdoor chairs we suggested earlier and you\u0027re ready for an outdoor meal with all the comforts of home. If sitting on the floor is more your thing, grab a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (save \u0026pound10) to keep you dry on damp ground.  It\u0027s also important to be able to keep meat, fish and drinks nice and cool when you\u0027re enjoying the outdoor cooking.

Every home convenience  To attain the goal of real luxury you need to be able to relax in your caravan or motorhome and make it a home away from home.

Ed Booker, 37, took part in the sinister ritual to rid a home of evil spirits - but he never realised the horrifying consequences it would have on his life. He claims his health rapidly went downhill and unexplainable things started happening after he participated in the paranormal cleansing. He says \u0027DIE\u0027 was scrawled on the inside of his windows and he even snapped an image showing the menacing circus worker lurking down a darkened corridor.  The final straw for his girlfriend Donna Hall, 31, came when she was attacked and pinned down by a macabre force at their home in Worthing, West Sussex, Ed claims. He said: “This ghost is ruining my life. My ex was attacked and pinned down. I’ve had mediums come in and they’ve been attacked too. “I’ve woken up with painful scratches down my arm. I feel like I’m in real danger.  “It has destroyed my relationship, my health is still suffering quite a lot. “I’m always depressed once I get out of the house I perk up but my mood drops as soon as I go back in. “I don’t know why it seems to want me. People have said it’s not the flat that’s evil, it’s you - it’s attached itself to you.” Ed has always been interested in the supernatural, and he has also taken part in several exorcisms as part of a ghost-hunting group.  The dark tale started when he and a team of paranormal investigators were called to rid a family home of dark forces, which had been tormenting the teenage son and his friends in Horsham, West Sussex. The events of that night were recently chronicled in Channel 4 docudrama True Horror. Ed said: “We didn’t like it as soon as we walked through the front door. Even the sceptics in the group didn’t want to go in. “When it came to do the clearing it just felt wrong. There were a lot of spirits there, all very negative.  “Then this figure came up in the middle of us - I can only describe it as a circus ringmaster, dressed all in black with a big top hat and a shovel on its shoulder. “It was just staring at us with a grin full of dirty, broken teeth. “It was an awful experience really. You never dream of something like this happening but it is real and it can happen.” In the following days, Ed - who takes tour groups around haunted buildings - said friends began seeing a tall, shadowy figure in the background. Ed even snapped some images claiming they show the ghost he claims is ruining his life.

The shocking incident occurred on a motorway in Bangkok on Sunday at around 10:20am. Footage from the scene shows a car travelling on the other side of the motorway, before the huge lorry veers towards the central reservation.  It then smashes into the divider before the lorry crumbles, sending debris across all four lanes on the opposite side of the motorway. The driver is then thrown from the window and hurtles through the air before hitting the bonnet of the approaching car. The unnamed driver of the oncoming car who records the shocking scenes, then pulls over on the hard shoulder. Images of the shocking aftermath show the wrecked lorry straddling both sides of the main road, while rescuers rushed to the driver\u0027s aid.

Gaffer Neil suggested Murray was just trying too hard to shine in front of his fellow-Dundee supporters and was happy with his contribution.The Dee boss is desperate to add more threat to his side and

illness.Although Ethel often visited Dundee she only moved back permanently to Broughty Ferry in February, where she now lives with son Brian.Although Ethel’s hearing is starting to deteriorate at the grand age of 106, she has had no major operations and her memory is second to none as she often reflects on her time playing field hockey as a goalie or her time spent travelling the world competing in Scottish Dancing competitions.She learned to drive while in Canada and only stopped when she was 92.Ethel said: “I have been very lucky to live this long and it is great to still keep in touch with

studio nine years ago when he launched Dundee Music Studios, said his father was president of the Tayside Opera for many years.\u0026#8220There was constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music department, but eventually the must have got a bit of extra cash and got a trombone so I started playing the trombone,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And I did that right thought to near the end of high school.\u0026#8221While he trained and began working as an engineer, he started DJing electronic and hip-hop music, later moving into scratch DJing.\u0026#8220Some of my friends had a band and my best friend had just been asked to be the drummer so he asked if I wanted to come along and do some scratching on top of the music,\u0026#8221 he said.After a few weeks, Tristan asked if they were ok with him bringing along his synthesizers and the band kicked off from there.\u0026#8220It was great, we had a great time doing that and the band was together for about 12 years.\u0026#8221Spending most of his spare time being involved in music and going into so

timing didn\u0026#8217t feel quite right.Then in 2007, both his parents passed away within two months of each other.\u0026#8220It kind of just turned my life on it\u0026#8217s head,\u0026#8221 he said.He quit his job and spent six months travelling around Australia with his future wife, before coming back to DundeeThen in 2009 he was told that a charity studio run by his friend\u0026#8217s dad near the Marketgait was up for sale, and Tristan decided to take the chance.\u0026#8220It was quite a big thing for me, a bit of a massive thing for me actually but at that point in my life it was a risk I was willing to take,\u0026#8221 he said.He launched the studio, a band booked one of his rooms full time and the business began to slowly grow, but it wasn\u0026#8217t until about a year and a half after opening that it began to turn profitable.\u0026#8220I remember six months into it being really really worried about things, that I might not be able to keep running,\u0026#8221 he

He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Monday 11 Jun 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

There always seems to be some excuse which is holding it back.\"Barber Greg Dodds, of For Men Only, was also frustrated at the lack of information.\"It seems ridiculous,\" he said.City centre manager David Haas said talks with the agents were progressing \"constructively\" but declined to comment on a possible start date.\"There are a number of issues relating to permission we are working through with council officials and the agent,\" he said.It has emerged that the council\u0027 principal officer for building conservation and environment, Andrew Puls, has raised concerns on conservation grounds regarding the proposed rebuild.In response to the application for the proposed demolition, he states the proposed replacement building is one storey lower and would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area\".A statement issued by two of the site owners, Mr Ali and Mr Cheng, states that \"regrettably\" unforeseen issues meant the scaffolding would not now be removed in June as originally envisaged.However it also claims that \"a new way forward\" being investigated should ultimately lead to a much speedier rebuild of the fire damaged building as well as allowing the owners to deal with various matters which had arisen from the recent planning application.Monday 11 Jun 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111980.jpg","title":"Pilot helps jet fan take to the skies","story":"\u0026nbspA BOY with a keen fascination for planes saw his dream come true when a pilot took him on a surprise trip in a vintage jet.Inverness teenager Yusuf (14) was known to the pilots at the city airport as \"the threshold lad\" because he would regularly visit the edge of runway five to take photographs of aircraft.The autistic lad, who has asked for his surname not to be published, loves to watch the Jet Provost aircraft in particular and thinks of the airport threshold as his \"happy place\" \u0026ndash convincing his mother, Mhairi, to take him there whenever things in life get tough.She said: \"His love of aviation \u0026ndash civil and military \u0026ndash has been there since he was younger, but has grown over the years into his main hobby.\"Pilot Paul Gibbs found out about Yusuf\u0027 passion for planes after his wife got talking to Mhairi by the runway during an earlier flight for the jet.

But a story like that is so dramatic that surely it would have passed down through the family.\"Mr Newton managed to track down the woman by following clues from sources such as reports of the fire in newspapers including the Inverness Courier, plus help from the family historian at the Highland Archive Centre.Having identified the butchers A\u0026ampD Macdonald, along with the location of the family farm in Glenmoriston, he subsequently discovered the great-granddaughter of Alexander Macdonald had married in Dundee in 2009 but was living in America.\"I do get a bit obsessive when it comes to researching local history,\" he conceded. \"It takes on a life of its own.\"It is like being part historian and part detective. You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful. Other contenders are Mac, Market Molly and Market Morag.A new plaque at the Market will honour the dog which was the only loss of life in the fire described by the Inverness Courier at the time as the most destructive in 40 years, causing estimated losses of \u0026pound12,000 and leaving families homeless.Monday 11 Jun 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109726.jpg","title":"Ugliest buildings in Inverness to be redeveloped and castle converted","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA \"ONCE in a generation\" opportunity for Inverness has been grasped by Highland Council as it has confirmed plans to buy the ugly office blocks in Upper Bridge Street which have blighted the riverside for years.The Inverness Courier revealed exclusively last week how redevelopment of the site will form part of a bigger plan to create a major new tourist attraction at Inverness Castle once the courts transfer to the new justice centre in Longman Road next year.The local authority confirmed\u0026nbspon Monday\u0026nbspthat it has put together an ambitious \"\u0026pound5 million-plus\" bid to buy the office blocks and the public will be consulted over what will go in their place.A deal is about to be signed with property firm Inverness Estates which currently owns the two 1960s buildings and retail outlets underneath.The sale price is commercially sensitive at the moment, but is expected to be disclosed at the end of the month.Highland Council already owns the neighbouring museum block.It has branded the project \"Inverness Castle \u0026ndash spirit of the Highlands\" and it will feature information and stories about the Highlands, with the aim of inspiring people to visit other parts of the region. It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Monday 11 Jun 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

latest figures from April this year from regulator Ofgem show the average available tariff is around £1,138 a year, based on average of dual fuel, direct debit and available paper tariffs from the six large suppliers with the cheapest being around £788 based on typical consumption and dual fuel average of available paperless tariffs paid by direct debit.Current council tax and Scottish Water payments for the remaining band E Woodland Grove apartments are £2,199.69 a year: representing a saving for those moving from F or G band properties in the city of around £490 to just over £1,000.Christine MacDonald, Woodland Grove’s sales advisor, said: “Interestingly, many of the homeowners here are quick to point out just how much of a difference they notice in their utility bills: choosing instead to spend what they’ve saved on themselves their hobbies or even using it towards a holiday.“And that’s easy too because Woodland Grove is close to excellent road, rail, sea and air

being found injured in a stairwell at a block of flats in Aberdeen.Around 4,500 fans – along with most of the Gothenburg Greats – packed the Richard Donald Stand last night as the club paid tribute to the man supporters called a “proper Aberdeen loon” and “a great man”.Applause rang out at the end of the night as 220 red and white balloons were released into the blue sky above Pittodrie, each symbolising the 220 games Cooper played for the club.Earlier in the day his friends and family paid their respects at a private funeral service, but they joined fans at Pittodrie to say goodbye to the popular player.Friends from the footballing world, including Joe Harper, Willie Miller, Craig Brown, Archie Knox and Andy Dornan, shared touching and funny stories about life with Neale, who was known as Tattie.Former Evening Express sports editor Charlie Allan also shared his memories.Son Alex Cooper, nephew Doug Blake, fan Jock Gardiner and childhood friend Paul Alexander also brought tears to the eyes of supporters with their memories of the former Airyhall Primary and Hazlehead Academy pupil.One of the fans in attendance, Iain McDonald, 70, of Bridge of Don, still has his original Gothenburg ticket from May 11 1983.He said: “It’s sad, very sad that he was the youngest and he was the first one to go. I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life. It shows his family a lot of folk are thinking about him.”After the service, fans praised the touching tribute.Duncan Smith, 46, of Heathryfold, said: “It was brilliant. Absolutely superb, and quite emotional.“He was a proper Aberdeen loon.“The Gothenburg Greats were my heroes when I was a kid.”Valerie Donald, 53, of Hardgate, said: “It was just brilliant. It was really emotional, and it was very well organised as well.“There were lots of lovely stories about him, they put a lot of thought into it.”Graham Morrice, 56, from Woodside, said: “It was a great tribute to a great man. Aberdeen thought the world of him, and he thought the world of Aberdeen.”Two fans, Patricia and Ali Anderson, travelled from Elgin to be at the ceremony.Ali said: “It was brilliant.“There’s not many people who would get that.”Patricia, who knew him, added: “It was just exactly him. That’s exactly what he was like.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece.

Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next

15 games on the go at one time and welcome at least 500 football stars of the future, in 59 teams, from across Scotland.Thanks to generous donations, all 30 goals at this year\u0026#8217s festival, for children born between 2006 and 2012, have been sponsored, with £995 being raised.Such was the response to the goal sponsorship that, last Friday, CDJFA decided to extend it to the 15 balls at £20 each. Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dinghy sailors delight at record may weather","story":"It particularly suited sailors at Campbeltown Sailing Club\u0026#8217s (CSC) reinstated Wednesday evening sessions organised by Kintyre Seasports Project\u0026#8217s Sid Gallagher.The action continues this Wednesday, from 7pm and all are welcome, especially total beginners, as all specialist equipment is provided.CSC\u0026#8217s Iain McGlashan said: \u0026#8216It is another good forecast for this Wednesday so some along if you can.\u0026#8216Wednesday evening sailing continues until  28 June.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.  Heather Jarron added: \u0026ldquoMany elderly residents without cars in this village would benefit greatly from having a pharmacy.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.  Steve Burnett found the poplar log at Yellowcraig, near Dirleton, two years ago and recently finished making the instrument.  It was unveiled ahead of World Oceans Day today (Friday) and was played for the first time in the sea at the beach, by musician Thoren Ferguson.  The violin is being endorsed by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) and will be taken to schools and communities as well as being used at events to highlight environmental issues.  The instrument, which Mr Burnett, of Edinburgh, has named Il Mare (Italian for the sea), is inscribed inside with the words, \u0026ldquoA voice from, and for the sea.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.

She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7907461.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"UK must not process Iranian funds until charity worker released     Nobel laureate","story":"              Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being used as a political pawn and the UK must not process any Iranian funds until she is released, a Nobel laureate has said.  Monday marks the British-Iranian charity worker\u0026rsquos 800th day in jail having been accused of spying.  It also marks her four-year-old daughter Gabriella\u0026rsquos fourth birthday and 800 days since she was separated from her parents.  Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe hoped she would be granted temporary release from prison, where she is serving a five-year prison sentence, to celebrate the birthday, but the application was refused.  She is facing a further hearing accused of an unspecified security charge and her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, believes she will be accused of spreading propaganda against Tehran\u0026rsquos Islamist regime.  Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights lawyer, former judge and human rights activist, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for her efforts to promote democracy and human rights, called for the mother-of-one to be released.  She said: \u0026ldquoYes, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being used as a political pawn but it is not just her.  \u0026ldquoThere are currently over 30 dual nationals that are being held in Iran, so pressure must be put on the Iranian government in that regard.  \u0026ldquoAny trade agreements must be conditional on the release of these dual nationals.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe,\u0026nbspfrom Hampstead, north London, was arrested and jailed in 2016.  She has consistently denied all allegations, insisting she was on holiday to introduce her daughter to her family.  The Free Nazanin Campaign has arranged an event outside the Foreign Office on Monday night to mark Gabriella\u0026rsquos fourth birthday, where 800 candles will be lit \u0026ndash one for each day she has been separated from her parents.  There will also be readings from family members and Labour MP Tulip Siddiq,\u0026nbspand a cake with happy birthday sang to Gabriella over Skype.  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was allowed to celebrate her daughter\u0026rsquos birthday with Gabriella in prison after an application for temporary release was refused.  She said: \u0026ldquoI thought that there would be a sense of humanity. But it was too good to be true. Not even for my daughter\u0026rsquos birthday.  \u0026ldquoI remember this day four years ago \u0026ndash that summer eating watermelon with her in our arms, and the first baby baths, feeling we had the most gorgeous child.  \u0026ldquoWill we ever experience that again?

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.

He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

It is understood that TPG and Poundworld\u0026rsquos management rejected offers to buy the business out of a pre-pack administration, and were hoping to sell it as a solvent business.  Other parties named as possible buyers were turnaround specialist Alteri Investors and Poundworld\u0026rsquos founder Chris Edwards.  But a deal could not be struck.  Poundworld\u0026rsquos losses widened in 2016-17 to \u0026pound17.1 million, from \u0026pound5.4 million of losses the year before.  The news came just days after House of Fraser detailed its plans to shut 31 stores, affecting around 6,000 jobs.  House of Fraser is seeking landlord approval for the restructuring plan, which is a form of insolvency known as a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA).  A raft of CVAs have been struck in recent months as retailers struggle amid surging costs, rising business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending.  Other retailers undertaking CVAs in a bid to keep trading include New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright.  Restaurant businesses have also been seeking to cut their costs with store closure programmes, with Carluccio\u0026rsquos, Byron and Prezzo all pushing through CVAs this year.

The Edinburgh parade was part of Processions, a mass participation artwork taking place simultaneously in the capitals of the UK to mark the achievements of the women\u0026rsquos suffrage movement.  The women and girls on the march wore suffragette colours of green, violet and white and were choreographed to appear as a moving suffragette flag.  The Edinburgh participants gathered at the Meadows before heading off through the city, ending by marching down the Royal Mile to the sounds of a piper playing Flower Of Scotland and past the Scottish Parliament.  Those taking part spanned all ages and many carried banners covering a range of causes.  These included embroidered banners thanking the \u0026ldquosister suffragettes, others proclaiming the suffragette slogans \u0026ldquoEquality for Women and \u0026ldquoDeeds Not Words and some simply stating \u0026ldquo100 years.  Modern political causes were also in evidence, with banners for the WASPI women fighting for pension equality.  Political parties were among the groups taking part in the parade, which was open to women and girls and those identifying as such, and other organisations involved included the Girl Guides and the Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Institute.  The event was produced by Artichoke and commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the UK\u0026rsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary.  Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said: \u0026ldquoProcessions is a great opportunity to celebrate the centenary of some women getting the vote, an important milestone in our country\u0026rsquos history.  \u0026ldquoAs we mark this anniversary and while we have come a long way since 1918, this event also offers an occasion for us all to reflect on the challenges and opportunities that still lie ahead.  \u0026ldquoEquality for women is at the heart of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos vision for an equal Scotland and our Programme for Government set out our ambitions, including legislating for gender balance on public sector boards, creating a new Advisory Council on Women and Girls, and piloting a returners project to help women back in to the workplace after a career break.  \u0026ldquoOur goal for all women and girls \u0026ndash in Scotland and around the world \u0026ndash is that they have a fair chance to succeed in life, no matter their gender.

Businessman Arron Banks, the founder of the Leave. EU group, is due to give evidence to the Commons inquiry into \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo this week.  After initially refusing, he has now agreed but says he is the victim of a \u0026ldquowitch hunt.  In his book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, Mr Banks admitted a single meeting with the Russian Ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, in September 2015.  However the Sunday Times and Observer reported an email trail revealing further meetings between the two men and Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore.  At one meeting, in November 2015, the day after the Leave.EU launch, the ambassador introduced Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore to a Russian businessman who offered a potentially highly lucrative business deal involving six Russian goldmines.  Mr Banks also visited Moscow in February 2016, during the referendum campaign.  And in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore met President-elect Donald Trump in New York, they had a lunch with the ambassador.  Mr Banks told the Sunday Times he also handed over phone numbers for members of Mr Trump\u0026rsquos transition team to Russian officials.  Damian Collins, chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said the discovery of the links was \u0026ldquobig news and very relevant to his \u0027fake news\u0026rsquo inquiry.  He told BBC Sunday Politics that the public had a \u0026ldquoright to know the nature of the contacts.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe want to understand more to what extent Mr Banks profited from his relationship with the Russian embassy. Did he make money out of it?  \u0026ldquoDid he use that money to fund campaigns? If he didn\u0027t then that\u0027s fine but given the prominent role he played we\u0027ve got the right to ask these questions.\"  Mr Banks, who gave \u0026pound12m in donations to Ukip and the Leave side, told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. It\u0026rsquos a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.  He later joked to Reuters that he was \u0026ldquostill waiting for the cheque from Moscow.  He said: \"This is just complete, absolute garbage - it is like the Salem witch hunt. They just keep on screaming \u0027witch\u0027, \u0027witch\u0027. They are trying to discredit everyone involved in Brexit.\"  Mr Wigmore said Leave.EU never offered any campaign information to any Russian.  The extent of the links with Russia was revealed in a cache of 40,000 emails shared by Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore with the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote The Bad Boys of Brexit.  She said the two men had been \u0026ldquoshamelessly used by the Russians, but that did not invalidate the judgment of the 17.4m people who voted to leave the EU.  Leave.EU was last month fined \u0026pound70,000 for breaching election law in the EU referendum.  The Electoral Commission said the group, which was separate from the official Vote Leave campaign, failed to report at least \u0026pound77,380 of its spending.  It has also referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police.  Mr Banks called it a \"politically motivated attack\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Harry and Meghan to follow in Charles and Diana   s footsteps on Australia NZ tour","story":"              The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will make an official visit to Australia, Fiji, the Kingdom of Tonga and New Zealand.
